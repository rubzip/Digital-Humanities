#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,"Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon Mary is thirty eight years old and two sons Elizabeth three years old and Pelayo seven years old Mary was orphaned when she was eleven years old and lived with her aunt Pepa her mother 's sister until a few years ago she emancipated Last January her aunt Pepa died for COVID leaving Maria as the sole heir to whom she left the modest house of her village where they lived together until Maria moved to Madrid to look for a better future But Maria today works as an employee in a restaurant charges 1000 euros a month and in the management where the tax matters take her they have told her that if she accepts her aunt 's inheritance she will have to pay 47,000 euros as inheritance tax A house that will inherit that cannot sell until it accepts the inheritance nor can it ask for a loan offering such a house in guarantee to face the payment of inheritance tax If you could sell this house which you can't the town 's real estate company has told you that they wo n't pay you more than 120,000 euros for it although Hacienda assures you and tells you that for the purposes of inheritance tax it has a value of 200,000 euros for those coefficients that they invent in the ministries and that have nothing to do with the reality of the real estate market Mary is faced with the disjunctive of renouncing the inheritance of the one who raised her and continuing with her 1000 euros a month raising two children or accepting the inheritance and paying 47,000 euros she does not have If you ask for a loan it has to be a personal loan to pay the tax and be able to keep your aunt Pepa 's house and it has to be a personal loan up to seven years and it will cost you more than 500 euros a month that is half your salary Not to mention that you will have to pay logically the IBI as well as install an alarm so that you wo n't overwhelm it You progress what would you do if you were Mary Going to the board of directors of an electric right Yeah good Paquita Maria 's neighbor has been hit by the lottery this Christmas she was hit by half a tenth of a player a prize of 200 000 euros a prize in cash for which she has to pay 32,000 euros in taxes Paquita therefore pays less for a lottery prize having cash than Mary for inheriting her aunt 's house than in the best case if she could sell it would receive 120 000 euros although Hacienda assures her that it is worth 200 000 Perhaps that modest house would serve as savings so that Mary 's children could have a future study a career get better training improve their lives Because tuition at the university for the Spanish is not free because the travel grants which are 2000 euros a year do not give for a student to live not three or four months if he is away from home And these are the Spaniards lords of the progressive left feminist ?ista ?ista whom you want to fry at taxes in order to avoid the accumulation of wealth and they say so without squandering The rich to whom you allude continually could be the politicians who go to the governing councils of public societies or to the so called oligopolies who without having given nor plate and only for having the card of the political party of the moment charge hundreds of thousands of euros The John Palomo I eat it I eat it The rich like for example the ministers ministers and 'ministers who constitute societies in tax havens planning their assets so as not to pay taxes and that their children or grandchildren inherit the fruit of the effort of the Spaniards who have worked to keep them comfortably in their armchairs and in their official cars Do we have to pay taxes Yes of course you have to pay taxes of course but they always pay the same the most defenceless the middle classes that you condemn to ostracism and disappearance and the working classes that with this tax system that eschews you for breathing you will never be able to save a euro And this is the sad raw reality Do you really believe that the millionaires to whom you plead tax a lot of money on inheritance and donations Either you are ignorant and live in a parallel world or directly lie I 've been a tax advisor for almost thirty years and I know that reality Their speeches are demagogic and claim rights for the most vulnerable while embracing them with new taxes without eliminating the previous ones and without offering opportunities for people to prosper The fiscal persecution in Spain is like this for the salary you earn you pay IRPF if you buy a house tax on transmissions if we spend and consume VAT if you sell the house surplus value and IRPF and if you die successions And although quality education is the best heritage and the social lift by antonomasia you now with this educational system that you have just implemented deficient and generally approved also intend to deprive the most humble Spaniards of a future of hope In Spain we live an unbearable fiscal hell whose collection is not intended for the welfare of the Spaniards but it feeds every day an ideological and globalist agenda that pushes us to economic and intellectual poverty it leads us to despair it attacks private property and aims to decimate the capacity of citizens to react indoctrinate and lie And for that you already have your media subsidized and busy who do not pay taxes for the subsidies they receive and who are directly engaged in distorting and manipulating the information to the government 's dictate In Spain we have the National Federation against Succession Tax a social and apolitical movement which I imagine you if tomorrow these gentlemen go out to protest will insult them as you did with farmers and truckers those ultra right activists right A federation that brings together the main associations and platforms that have been fighting against the injustice of this cruel tribute for years and that have collected against them more than a million signatures of citizens who do not belong to the elites who are neither rich nor powerful on the contrary they are humble workers and people who are expoliated and who in many cases live real dramas We are facing a tax that violates constitutional rights under articles 14 and 33 and does not fulfil the redistributive function of article 31 of the Spanish Constitution From this tribute we must highlight its scant impact on public resources with a collection of around 27 billion euros And listen said a minister Chiqui if a billion are nothing If 1 billion is nothing twice as much as 1 billion is nothing twice as much as nothing is nothing Do n't you By the way it must be that the minister has a lot of work because the latest collection figures she offers from this tax are 2019 I imagine it will be because of the pandemic or the Putin war The VOX Parliamentary Group in May 2020 presented a bill to eliminate this tax an initiative that was vetoed by the government without an option to debate in this House Once again the Government turned its back on its people ignoring their demands but as perseverance is our guide here we are debating today At a time of crisis when European governments reduce taxes the Spanish Government does not choose to increase the tax burden on the average citizen and if it reduces something as it has done with the price of fuels does it at the expense of whom Of the big millionaire oil tankers No it does so at the expense of the gas station 's pocket which with its effort and scarce resources has to be financed Who do you owe you You see the plumber socialists and 'socialists but well let 's see if it governs We can at once and already the situation improves This text of the bill highlights powerful reasons that justify the arrogation of this tribute This is one of the measures we consider in the Agenda Spain page 22 in case any minister wants to consult it and it is point 46 of the 100 measures of VOX This Agenda Spain which VOX defends for all of Spain without filters or discrimination is to place all Spaniards on an equal footing But as we already know the parliamentary groups that cling to the survival of this tribute precisely those of the rotating doors and boards of directors of the oligopolies ignoring the voice of the people will come up here to tell lies will deal as if this tax is present throughout Europe Lie It does not exist in more than half of the countries of the European Union Which is just progressive and redistributes wealth False It is a tribute given to the autonomous communities and although any of them could eliminate it none does all maintain it At best some improves it such as the Community of Madrid which is the second in collection These differences deepen the deep inequality between the Spaniards becoming confiscatory and precisely a scourge for the working classes not taking into account the real economic capacity of the heir They will say that it is taxed on the real value of inherited real estate Lie The value attributed to the assets subject to taxation is determined by the Administration apart from the reality of the real estate market by a method that leads to an overvaluation of the assets and if you do not agree resort to the courts but first pass by cash and I paid because if not he seized his assets It 's funny because if you offer the Treasury a security right to pay a debt because you have a debt I charge you 100 but if you then have to charge you because we inherit the same good I charge you 200 Same administration even good different standards embarrassing In short this is a tax that generates inequality does not comply with the principle of progressiveity does not contribute to the redistribution of wealth discourages the saving of families represents a minimum contribution to public resources gives up inheritance and finally is questioned by the European institutions Moreover it is a very old tax socialist gentlemen its origin dates from the dates prior to 1812 those remote times that you have removed from history books but which now rescue it if it is to collect taxes right All right Are you progressives of mouth and of package and is it that in the middle of the 21st century when this tax faces numerous problems of social legitimacy being the most controversial tax figure of our tax system do you not embarrass the Spaniards while maintaining a government with 22 ministries other 17 kingdoms of taifas with 21.3 billion for policies of more inequality with a political spending shot that keeps at the expense of suffocating the citizen They 're not ashamed because they should n't have it but I 'm telling you there 's little left for them to keep docking the Spaniards because VOX is already stepping on their heels We are the only hope the only alternative for a future of prosperity for all of Spain Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,24.030903,-3.7000167,28,"thank madam president ladies gentlemen

#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,"I 've seen things you would n't believe Attack ships in flames beyond Orion I 've seen C rays shine in the dark near Tannhäuser Gate I have seen in these strange days I have seen it Mr Rufián defend the family even with jacket and tie I have seen a spokesman of We can deny that he was ever liberal when he was and the other declare that he is when he has never been I have seen the PP defend the nuclear after closing Garoña and having celebrated it I have seen the Minister of Defense say that there were mafias of human trafficking after having called us xenophobes to say the same thing months before I have seen the Minister for Transitional Ecology criticise the European Union for the green classification of nuclear energy by the way without anyone calling it a hydrophobic I have seen the First Vice President of the Economy admit that inflation will be unravelled for months after being for months denying us and touching us by saying what was coming And I have seen I swear to you that I have seen the President of the Government the same one who said that the Ministry of Defence had to close now defend VOX 's old proposal to invest at least 2 of the gross domestic product in the Ministry of Defence assuming one of our own points Yes I have seen things that you would not believe to all who insulted us to assume our postulates with a few months of delay All those moments in which we were criticized will be lost in time like tears in the rain because this debate has served to remind us that in so many things VOX was right Today after seeing what we have all seen some motions for resolutions are debated and voted in this House Ours is necessarily of total rejection it 's called that and that 's how we feel about it I believe that our first obligation is to claim the role of this House the role of the Legislature which is more important than ever because never before had a President of the Government come this far At the request of VOX the Constitutional Court censored that Pedro Sánchez had cancelled control of Congress at the time when the executive had accumulated more power in the history of democracy Never before had a President of the Government so boldly swept the work of the Courts through the abuse of the use of the figure of the royal decree law never before had the activity of this House been so cynically hijacked with the blocking of the processing of more than fifty rules with the rank of law and never before had Congress been subjected to the blackmail to which this Government is subject We remember that for the reception of European funds this government has committed itself in Brussels without even asking here to pass more than sixty rules with a law rank that can only be passed in this House Ladies and gentlemen in democracy respect for the separation of powers is not a whim it is not an option it is not an accident it is a basic foundation of the health of the rule of law and the government without respecting that principle has only one name and that name is that of autocrat That is why this debate on motions for resolutions cannot be held without a previous demand that the role that should never have been lost be returned to this House Ladies and gentlemen Spain is going badly The context is not easy the truth but it is difficult to imagine a Government capable of aggravating things further to put us in a worse political economic social and institutional situation and frankly I find it difficult to imagine such unbelievable unself critical self congratulating and substantial motions for resolutions as have been brought to this Parliament by the parliamentary groups supporting this Government Since VOX we have presented yes a total global and frontal rejection to the direction in which they want to continue to lead our country Spain needs to leave behind the ideological sectarianism that for decades driven by the left and assumed by the right wing so called has turned Spain into a frustrated experiment of the evil so called feminism of the climate religion of relativism and of globalism so that from now on it can begin to attend to what really represent national emergencies We refer to them in our motions for resolutions Ladies and gentlemen Spain cannot continue to be subjected to a continuous and structural blackmail accepted by Pedro Sánchez which has made the governability of our country depend precisely on those who want to end it on those who just a year ago gave a coup d'état in Catalonia or on the political arm of ETA Spain cannot be in the hands of those who want to destroy it ladies and gentlemen That is why as the rest of the Western countries are already doing it is urgent to put an end to a design problem that is structural The Constitution says its article 2 is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation and that unity is being violated ladies and gentlemen In the motions for resolutions of the VOX Group we want to ensure that the Spanish people are equal where they live and refer to different areas in the health field for example by providing a portfolio of common services throughout Spain or in the field of water policy by guaranteeing the supply of water to all Spaniards through the implementation of a national hydrological plan But we must also ensure in other areas that the Spaniards are once again equal before the law as guaranteed by article 14 of our Constitution because ladies and gentlemen gender laws which establish a presumption of truth to a party to the party who denounces erode the procedural guarantees of the defendant trampling on the most elementary principles of the law established more than two thousand years ago The gender laws that preach real equality attack above all this fundamental value that of equality generating different legal consequences in the face of the same acts Gender laws which claim to defend victims leave many victims who have been declared by the left that they appear to deserve less protection women attacked by men who are not their partners or by other women who are mothers or grandmothers abused by their children women attacked by strangers Do n't they deserve the same protection We therefore call for the repeal of gender laws and their replacement by a domestic violence law the abolition of the Ministry of Equality and the end of indoctrination in the classrooms Our third motion for a resolution refers to economic policy or rather to its absence Ladies and gentlemen it 's not Putin it 's not Franco and it's not the virus It is you Pedro Sánchez your Government and your erratic economic policy that explains to a great extent the biggest economic collapse in any country first the delay in recovery then and finally that Spain will be the last OECD country to recover its pre-crisis GDP level which will not reach until 2024 Ladies and gentlemen this government has triggered public debt putting it in a situation of extreme vulnerability From 35 of the debt on GDP that we had in 2017 the debt has increased to 118 in 2021 but it is that the AIReF warns of the consolidation of a structural deficit that would trigger the debt in the medium term up to 140 But the worst is that today there are forty thousand companies less than before the pandemic and on top of that they are now paying more taxes than ever with a greater debt that unfortunately they will not be able to pay and merely trying to survive Nor has this government been able to prevent or at least moderate the impoverishment that is causing inflation which was not a cyclical or transitory phenomenon and which reached 10.2 in June its highest level in thirty seven years The result is that far from recovering the levels of the pandemic with the highest unemployment rate in Europe with a fiscal effort 11 points higher and without reducing political spending we have been placed in a compromised situation which will not be corrected by assaulting the National Institute of Statistics We have been demanding it and we reiterate it today because there is no time to waste the Government must speed up structural reforms stop attacking those who employ and generate wealth and develop a medium and long term fiscal strategy that realistically and crediblely guarantees the sustainability of public accounts But that of course would begin by putting an end to the Government of the twenty two ministries and to the greater political spending of democracy by undoing the client network that has so boldly articulated and by renouncing those thousands of advisers political positions and privileges on which this first government of the coalition of democracy has based He has no authority to demand an income pact that has deployed the greatest political expense in history which in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Civil War has not hesitated to raise its salary and who has turned its day to day into a parade of privileges such as the obscene trip to New York in Falcon of those who said they renounce the privilege of taxi Ladies and gentlemen we have to choose either the welfare state or the welfare of politicians and in VOX we have no doubt That is why we urgently propose to carry out an audit of public expenditure and to eliminate any unnecessary political expenditure in particular for political parties trade unions and employers which should be financed from the funds of their membership quotas We must recover the holy fear of deficit an expression so old that some of you will not even be remembered as you will not remember the last time Spain had a surplus You would all be fired in any company that throws red numbers year after year as its managers continue to squander the money of their shareholders which in this case ladies and gentlemen are the Spaniards Spain must regain the lost confidence and for that in addition to regaining the balance of public accounts it must regain the prestige of its institutions The deterioration to which Pedro Sánchez has been subjected to our institutions the Ministry of Public Prosecutions the Attorney General 's Office the CIS Spanish Radiotelevision the Civil Guard the Court of Auditors the National Market Commission even strategic companies such as Indra but also the Bank of Spain the AIReF or the Constitutional Court itself which they now want to control is unqualified None of them have escaped Pedro Sánchez 's control attempt or his maneuvers to control them But most particularly the assault on the judiciary must be halted The institutions must be shielded from the interference of the Government which is also indeed a national emergency We cannot wait any longer we must reform the system of election of the members of the governing body of judges so that judges are elected by the judges and from among the judges It must be ensured that the investigation of criminal proceedings continues to be conducted by judges and not by the Ministry of Public Prosecutions which we already know is dependent on We must put an end to the politicization of the Constitutional Court and demand that it settle judgements expeditiously not by ten years of delay in some cases And it is that the good functioning of the judicial system is vital for the health of democracy as is the good functioning of the energy market for its economic sustainability Ladies and gentlemen this government 's energy policy is a major waste of money When they brought their climate change law we were the only ones to oppose the self injury assumed in the name of climate religion and the only ones to defend our energy sovereignty and not the progressive ideas that are condemning our homes and our industry to ruin We denounce the unwillingness to give up even to ban the exploitation and exploration of our own resources while China and India fire to infinity their emissions or while we buy from France and Morocco nuclear and coal energy respectively Today once again reason is imposed Today once again VOX was right Spain pays the most expensive electricity in Europe and Europe rectifies and declares gas and nuclear as green energy even if you do not like it But the Spaniards do n't have to pay for their climate dogmatism on the bill for light Therefore we propose to implement urgently a national energy sovereignty plan that prioritizes the interests of Spain and the Spanish because it is common sense Spain 's interest should also have governed our foreign policy but it has not The Government has preferred to devote our foreign action to promoting its ideological dogmas in a feminist foreign policy And what results have we achieved In just four years the Government of Pedro Sánchez has laid waste to a position of more than three hundred years in Gibraltar has handed over Western Sahara to Morocco putting an end to the position maintained by Spain for almost fifty years and leaving in the wrong place one of our largest gas suppliers and has squandered Spain 's position of prestige in relation to Ibero America maintaining a double game with the worst Ibero American dictatorships and abandoning our Cuban Venezuelan or Nicaraguan brothers And when it seemed impossible to go beyond it it has betrayed our allies in the war of Ukraine firing gas purchases to Russia and dragging feet in the shipment of material to Ukraine Spain has to regain its lost international prestige be recognized by our partners as a reliable partner and expressly assert our interests on the world stage And that also implies responsibility That 's why VOX has been defending increasing defence investment for a long time reaching 2 of GDP Once again VOX was alone defending the need to provide our Armed Forces with the necessary resources That is why we are glad today that many of you are right when you rectify This is also the case with immigration For years VOX alone warned about the effects of the migration invasion encouraged for decades which is adding to our neighborhoods which do not dignify to tread the political elites in very dangerous areas Therefore you do not hesitate to propose a massive regularization or to propose the repopulation of Spain abandoned with waves of immigrants That is why its 2050 Plan calls for 250,000 emigrants to be attracted in the coming years And that is why we refuse to see what is happening in the multicultural ghettos which are already a threat to the safety of our citizens in many European cities",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,28.579851,-7.792022,28,"'ve seen things would n't believe attack ships flames beyond orion 've seen c rays shine dark near tannhäuser gate seen strange

#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,"Lords of Citizens they have repeatedly told us that they do not want to be like us Certainly we do not want to be like you either and it seems that there are also many voters who want to be like you judging by the results of the last consultations You tell us that they are unconditionally pro-immigration and that they consider mass emigration to be one of the characteristics of contemporary society I believe that this shows that they put their moral narcissism forward that is their progressive self esteem how multicultural and tolerant I am to the sense of reality and politicians are obliged to attend above all to reality And the reality is that you cannot compare the time when yes certain liberal authors you always claim to be liberal even usurp and monopolize it or try to monopolize it considered immigration law as a fundamental right in the 19th century because the circumstances of the 19th century are not comparable to the current ones In the 19th century it was an intra-Western immigration of Poles who were going to the United States or of Italians who were going to France western populations and therefore there was no cultural shock the clash of civilizations that today occurs with immigrants from civilizations very different from Western ones in values such as for example respect for women The West is an island of respect for women in an ocean of misogynistic civilizations This should be taken into account And who says it and who is measuring the impact of this massive influx of men from Misogynistic countries into Europe is precisely Ayaan Hirsi Ali the author I referred to earlier who is of Somali origin and to whom I do not think they are going to call white supremacist You always boast of liberals for it was a great liberal Milton Friedman who celebrated that you cannot at the same time have a welfare state and open borders To a generous welfare state millions of immigrants will flow simply to receive subsidies not as in the 19th century when one went to the United States to work hard no now many people come with a different mentality I do not say that all much less come to receive subsidies The ease of communication is also not comparable Today it is very easy to move from one country to another even for people who do not have great economic means therefore the number of potential immigrants is simply inimitable Africa has a population of 12 billion twice the European population and it is estimated that by 2050 the African population will be four times the European population The median income of African countries is seventeen times lower than the median income of European countries Therefore we have a continent seventeen times poorer than another one separated by 14 kilometres of sea The situation is potentially explosive and certainly not manageable You who defend the right to immigration in the abstract are willing to receive the four hundred million Africans who according to a Gallup survey of 2018 would like to move to Europe They 're thinking about doing it and they 're saving up to try It 's getting cheaper and cheaper to jump to Europe In recent years the number of nationalizations of foreigners who acquired Spanish citizenship in particular 53 in the last year has grown steadily and in 2020 120 164 foreigners were naturalized I wanted to compare this figure and I finish with another one that seems dramatic to me in 2020 340 000 children were born in Spain It has been an absolute negative record for centuries for centuries there were not so few children born in Spain In addition only 244,000 of them are Spanish mothers The fertility of the Spanish women at this time is 1.25 children per woman This Government supported by progressive consensus has designed a national demographic challenge strategy in which the words family father mother or children do not appear once Then the lines are clear It seems that the elites both from Brussels and the progressive elites here have decided that the solution to our demographic problem is to open the borders to massive immigration from other continents and not to boost national birth Only a few Central European countries which by the way are constantly harassed by Brussels technocrats have made it clear that they have been betting not on immigration but on boosting

#MaríaTeresaLópezÁlvarez,that allows you to respond to the problems the ones that make arguments and on the other hand there are those who scream yes On the one hand we are the ones who understand that politics is the tool that allows us to respond to the problems that citizens have There are groups which when times of difficulty are experienced open up to dialogue and negotiation in order to find the best solutions to our country 's socio-economic problems The first thing I want to do therefore is to thank those groups that make up what has been called the investment block because their gesture of not submitting amendments in full opens up that space and that time necessary to seek agreement on the budgets that are at the heart of the proposal for economic transformation and social protection that the progressive government has set aside and contains the measures that together with these groups we have been adopting here in plenary after plenary Therefore we have the hand to look for that agreement that will allow us to finally achieve the budgets that will make those policies that we have already adopted here a reality On the other hand there are the advertisers of the apocalypse negators of everything and contributors of nothing That 's the reality I 'm not insulting Denialists of everything and contributors of nothing You see these budgets allocate EUR 275 billion to unprecedented social investment in our country EUR 275 billion is dedicated on the one hand to strengthening public services and social protection policies that make sense to our welfare state and on the other to making more of the solidarity network that we have in order to prevent anyone from being abandoned to their fate That is why there are the resources so that our pensions go up with the CPI and our older ones do not lose purchasing power there are the resources for young people to have help to rent a flat and have more scholarships and higher ones to relieve their families and they can continue and complete their training the resources that allow workers to have free transport to their workplace the aids for families without resources to have a minimum living income measures to keep them out of the light the attention that the dependents do not die in the limbo of waiting without the help they deserve by law and the unprecedented investment in primary care and education As I say it is an unprecedented social investment in the history of this country But in addition the budgets contain the resources that will enable Spain to be modernised and begin to update our productive model more than 16 billion in R D+i in real investment 12 000 the great commitment to ecological and digital transformation the destination of European funds aid to self employed people and SMEs It could be what 's left of tomorrow but the minister has already done it these two days with much better precision than I have By the way I have to thank the minister for the effort of budgetary pedagogy which has led to her almost losing her voice Thank you Minister because this saves me from derailing one game after another games that show that this Government is moving forward with a firm step in its three objectives protecting Spanish citizens and not abandoning anyone transforming the country to achieve a greener more digital more competitive strategically autonomous Spain and at the forefront of what is happening today in the world and fairly and equitably distributing public resources and also the costs and burdens of the crisis three objectives protecting transforming and distributing in a fair way which we should all share But no this is where the apocalypse advertisers appear Therefore the first horseman of the Apocalypse they seek to frighten people by constantly repeating that this government is generating an unorbited public debt that will have to be paid by the next generations and the next ones Okay Can you tell me who will pay the 500 billion euros I repeat 500 billion euros of debt generated by Mr Rajoy 's time Are you going to pay for it by cleavage or are we already paying for it this generation and the next Because if you 're going to pay it I 'm quiet but if we 're paying it now and we 're going to keep paying it it 's you who have to shut up Some data to clarify your brilliant management From 2011 to 2018 public debt in Spain increased by 43.63 four times more than in the rest of Europe increased debt its most beloved leader Mr Rajoy However from 2018 to 2021 with Pedro Sánchez the debt in Spain has increased by 17.83 2 more than the European average ConRajoy 43 With Pedro Sánchez 2 But this year moreover the debt is going to fall and next year even more By the way it would be good if we were ever told why your Government so indebted to the Spaniards Because the progressive government with its debt has long supported ERTs that have saved millions of jobs helped families bought vaccines increased social benefits rebuilt public services and helped the productive economy However you cut salaries cut benefits cut services cut investments cut everything that moved raised all taxes and owed us As I said the other day yours is a minor economic miracle There 's nowhere to catch him and they come here bragging about his great contribution to this country So ladies and gentlemen of the PP let us not boast and do not come to the tale that Pedro Sanchezabra the gates of hell of debt because hell is you Second horseman of the Apocalypse Look modern democracies I tell you because they are often forgotten have been built on a social contract based on a reasonable division of capital and labour The benefits ownership and freedom of the market were respected and in return a shared solidarity was required with which to maintain public services and with them a welfare state that guaranteed citizens that they were free from the tyranny of necessity And all this through progressive taxation both for income from work and for capital By the way tomorrow forty years of the great socialist victory that launched the Government that began to build in Spain the welfare state Because although the governments of VOX which are already beginning to make scares and look to the sky and some others believe that Franco did so it was the governments of Felipe González who set up the public health system beyond what was the attention of Social Security making millions of people who were not entitled to enter the system and have the right to health in this country those who put compulsory education up to the age of sixteen and by their hand public education in a country with too much illiteracy inheritance of Francoism and a public pension system that included millions of people especially women who had not been able to contribute because they had exploited them Yes this was done by the governments of Felipe González Franco did what he did was imprison banish and shoot those who later made it possible That was Franco and you your heirs But I return to the social contract because it was unilaterally broken by the neoliberal tide that began in the 1980s with Thatcher and Reagan but which had its maximum expression in the previous crisis when they imposed all of our recipes applied the law of the strongest and abandoned millions of people who ended up in the midst of marginalization and poverty But I have bad news for you ladies and gentlemen of the right your neoliberal project failed and today it is the social democratic project that is rebuilding the social contract and yes once again through taxation of progressive taxation You even though you now hide a lot are adamant enemies of taxation They have said that it is the theft of the state that the government is supplying itself with them that money is better in the pocket of the citizens But this whole verb is nothing but a trap You use citizens but what you really think is that money where it is best in your pockets in yours in those of those who already have them full Because for more than 90 of the population taxes are not a theft they are the health of their family the education of their children the pensions of their elderly the care of dependents the safety of their streets the roads on which they travel the trains on which they travel For more than 90 of Spanish and Spanish people taxes are the guarantee of their freedom and the guarantee of equal opportunity for life Yes because taxes for many are their own life because the vast majority know that they could never pay the 200 000 euros that your child 's education costs from the start to the end of a career they know that they could never pay out of their pocket for the operations or care that a disease can provide for them Ladies and gentlemen of the right the vast majority of Spaniards and Spaniards know that their best investment and the best way to secure their future and cope with the adverse moments of their lives is to pay taxes And you are making an absolutely demagogic speech tremendously anti-pedagogic of the real and profound meaning of taxation as a tool to fight against inequality and country builder and moreover demolishing for the system we have built among all I know you do n't care but the vast majority do n't Stop lying The left is not imposing expropriation taxes The fiscal pressure in Spain and you know it is far less than that of the countries in our environment We are far behind those countries that we then want to look like Stop saying that you defend the popular classes when in Andalusia you have forgiven the wealth tax to the great fortunes with one hand and with the other you ask 1 billion others to solve their problems Stop saying that they defend the popular classes when they are against the big companies who yesterday told us that they had increased their profits by 25 or 29 because of the rise of lashipothecas because of the price of energy that is to say because of the crisis and they bring some of those benefits to those who are having a hard time with the crisis when they use as Moreno Bonilla has already announced the tax on the great fortunes because it bothers them that whoever else has to pay more or when he announces a great fall in taxes in the Community of Madrid which dazzles the world he reduces 80 euros to the incomes that earn 20 000 but 580 euros to the people who earn 90 000 in a range of progressiveness By the way it forgets those who earn less than 20 000 to whom the government of Pedro Sánchez does help with the minimum living income with the electric bonds with the law against evictions with unemployment benefits but that from their governments on the right they receive nothing at all I mean as always you help the poor by lowering taxes on the rich That 's what they do But yes when they govern they raise all taxes especially VAT which is the one that most affects the middle and working classes So ladies and gentlemen of the PP do n't say that Pedro Sánchez opens the doors to fiscal hell because the infernofiscal and above all vital are you Third horseman of the Apocalypse Pensions Pensions are not sustainable they must be lowered You 're always looking for a problem instead of ever providing a solution They always go with the discourse of fear of hopelessness of the broken future for the elderly Updating pensions so that they do not lose purchasing power seems an abomination to them and they do not hesitate to confront grandchildren with grandparents which is the exercise of greater irresponsibility never seen in this country But look Spanish Social Security is the best equity tool we have It is the system that guarantees a dignified life in old age and the truly equal system for all Spanish and Spanish wherever they are live where they live and have worked where they have worked Everyone benefits applying the same rules to everyone and we can proudly say that public pensions are the greatest expression of equality and solidarity of all and of all Spaniards of whom they were of whom they are and of whom they will be And this Government is making a huge effort to make them sustainable to clarify and differentiate the expenses and revenues of those who are not He has announced that in two or three years we will achieve the neutrality of the system that is that expenses and revenues have zero deficits and these budgets for the first time in three years put in the Social Security hut EUR 3 billion to go and fill it that hut from which you took the 60 billion that the evil Zapatero had left you That is with progressive governments there will be public pensions that will be revalued with the CPI and with you there will be private pension plans because this will feed the business of one of your own Ask the pensioners of this country who is hell whether Pedro Sánchez who is committed to the sustainability of the public pension system or Mr Feijóo who is neither expected nor expected And fourth rider The economy The Spanish economy is sinking and inflation is going to devour us But does it hurt them so much to recognize that GDP is growing and inflation is falling in Spain as in no other country in Europe Does it bother you so much that Spain is doing well So deep rooted have you that the worse for Spain the better for me We do not ask them to join fervently in the policies that this Government is implementing and that are working We simply ask you since you are so disgusted to display yourself in that condition a little patriotic sensitivity that you do not go out there and say that Spain is a disaster that you do not go to Brussels and ask that you do not give us European funds that if you are going to take a photo do not make it look bad because they do not give you the reason I know that it must be very hard to come up to this rostrum as Mrs Gamarra said yesterday to make a catastrophic speech about the mismanagement that this government is making of European funds and only a few hours later to see how Brussels tells the European PP to stop plotting that Brussels is disbursing money from the funds to Spain because the objectives are being met They do n't give one And I know ladies and gentlemen of the PP that you have it wrong that you have a big problem because you wanted to see in Liz Truss your salvation your great white conservative hope tax cuts no energy savings no energy price controls no Iberian exceptions Finally yours what you have been telling us for so long brought to practice So of course they quickly launched to tell us that to see if we learned that this was to have the feet on the ground and know what was going on Forty five days later the British economy sinks and the risk premium goes off the debt becomes unsustainable the country makes water everywhere and the fifth conservative leader appears on the stage Yeah I know they 're turning her down now It 's like Barcenas that gentleman passing by Liz Truss is that lady who walked into 10 Downing Street Us Liz Truss who is he Mr. Feijoo has never said that there is a need for drastic reductions Now,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,31.209343,-5.0349207,28,allows

#AndrésAlbertoRodríguezAlmeida,Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen Mrs Muñoz Vidal you are presenting today an initiative that sounds very good in principle a tax deduction precisely for an issue of first necessity such as the payment of the mortgage on habitual housing but I am very surprised at the implementation of your initiative which I understand is not typical of the nature of such initiatives You say that it has to be at least 25 a ceiling of EUR 400 a temporary scope and also an extraordinary character referring to the mortgages subscribed until 1 August I have been reviewing last week 's urgent inquiry the statement of the motion and I have also waited for your intervention today because I hoped that you would in some way explain something about the data on which it has been based for those levels of achievement I mean why are you talking about a ceiling of 400 euros Why not 500 or 300 Why at least 25 of the tax deduction Why not more Why not less And above all it should assess the fiscal scope of this measure How many people are you going to get to How many people can benefit It is an elementary thing that should have been accompanied by a concrete measure in those terms Another thing he has forgotten is to say the impact that this measure would have on the state 's revenues because in order to position ourselves we will have to value the benefit that this tax deduction would bring and how many Spaniards it would reach but we also need to know how it will impact the public accounts and what things are not going to be able to be paid for that income reduction in the public accounts It seems that the liberals on this occasion did not want to throw themselves into the pool or say what will happen to the measure they propose In this they look a bit like the People 's Party which talks a lot about tax cuts but does n't talk about where they 're going to cut spending so that that tax cuts are possible and do n't help increase the public deficit Because these left wing gentlemen have been increasing and increasing the public deficit to levels that are absolutely unsustainable that are tearing down future generations and precisely in a scenario in which the European Central Bank has said that it ends with the programme of incentives for the mass purchase of public debt In that scenario not to mention the counterpart that has to have any reduction in the income of the State is reckless and makes its measure become if I may say so an absolutely populist measure They have left us alone again as in so many other important things because we are the only political party in this Chamber that talks about tax cuts but puts the counterpart saying where public spending is going to be cut Precisely the left always justifies the increase of taxes by the welfare state today it has been said here by several of those who have preceded me in the rostrum of speakers that we must continue to raise taxes under the pretext of the welfare state but it is only their welfare state of which they sit here the state of political welfare and of their chiringuitos There is a lot of co-responsibility in this serious situation and I am referring to the People 's Party I do n't know if this is going to make a second Rajoy failing his promises or get us into an increase in public spending I think we must speak sincerely to the citizens because they deserve it We must be realistic and even if we are left alone by the fifty two Members of VOX we are not concerned because in Spain as in Europe it is the time of the patriots Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,23.391188,-5.2516975,28,thank much madam president ladies gentlemen mrs muñoz vidal presenting today initiative sounds good

#RivoltaErica,"RIVOLTA L SP PSd Az Madam President on the report to Parliament by the President of the Council of Ministers and the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance pursuant to Article 6 the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will vote in favour of the debt claim for a total amount of 14.3 billion for 2022 Most of these resources derive from the increased VAT revenue resulting from the dynamics of imported energy prices and the rise in inflation which is about to exceed as estimated by the International Monetary Fund 6 We are deeply concerned about the fate of Italian citizens our communities their present and their near future More resources must be unlocked without delay to support individuals families and businesses in order to counter the effects of inflation the increase in energy products and the effects of drought and to prevent the country from falling into recession Those who have been careful have heard that practically every Group has repeated the same things the arguments and priorities are the same for everyone It is necessary to reduce the tax burden on labour the real burden that cripples business growth and rising wages therefore cutting the tax wedge is essential There is also a great need for extraordinary fiscal peace a pact with taxpayers that allows the State to recover resources that are otherwise impossible to collect to be allocated to measures to support the income of individuals families municipalities and regions In a few days by 8 August more than 500,000 taxpayers will have to pay all the installments of the break up b for 2021 in order not to lapse from the facilitated definition instead the installments relating to 2022 will have to be paid within four months by 5 December We believe that immediate action is needed through a review of the installment plans so that everyone is in a position not to succumb Just look at the numbers of house sales and auction halls they are a very worrying index which describes very well the dramatic effects on the lives of normal people Another priority is to continue to take action on the transfer of the building tax credit Strong action is needed on energy prices and to counter the effects of drought It is also important to act to support the purchasing power of households and it is essential to zero VAT rates on basic necessities The timing is tight the sharing of the stringed resolution made by all the Groups beyond the necessary distinction on the priorities of each individual Group is the best response of the Senate to the emergencies of the country and to the needs of the population families small medium and large enterprises local authorities who are in a desperate situation in the formation of budgets and of the Regions especially for health for what will be the development of the pandemic in autumn but also for all the structures and for the speech related to the energy efficiency and energy consumption of the buildings of

#CalandriniNicola,Mr President from a decree law that has such a fanciful title cuts prices we would have sincerely expected much more especially for Italian companies and families that are now exhausted Perhaps the measure in our examination tries to do something clearly also with reference to expensive energy and expensive bills but it does so as always in a very mild and temporary way without having a solution in the medium and long term therefore always using buffer solutions You have extended the cut in excise duties on fuels and we are clearly very pleased about that but this does not solve the problem underlying the speculation on prices that exists and is very clear The theme of speculation was not raised by the Brothers of Italy party but your Government and in particular your ministers Cingolani and Patuanelli If you have identified the source of this problem for more than a few months now why do you keep looking Honestly we still can't understand it You have extended from April to June the possibility of indemnifying electricity and gas bills even this is only a palliative intervention because installment certainly does not solve the problem Postponing and delaying a payment does not mean in any way reducing the extent to which the same payment is imposed on Italian households and companies We would also have expected more effective action on this issue It is therefore clear that you know how to put only patches to these interventions without reaching what we have always been asking for since the beginning of the pandemic emergency and the beginning of the conflict structural solutions which are not there and it is not even predictable that they can be there With this decree law allowed to pay the bills in installments with the next intervention you will give 200 euros to pay the bills and do the shopping A measure that costs € 6 billion in public contributions This figure is added to the EUR 7 billion allocated in the budget law to make that ephemeral operation We agree when it comes to reducing taxes but we are talking about EUR 7 billion to reduce the Irpef rates by 2 points and no one has noticed the tax savings you have always talked about It is therefore billions of euros that do not create a multiplier effect and therefore do not allow a bounce of the domestic product What then about the reform of the land register which increases the tax levy on the house Who knows if in the next decree you will introduce the asset so dear to the Italian left With the measure we are considering today we allow the municipalities with the red boxes to raise the additional Irpefs which are burdening our taxpayers Therefore with one hand give and with the other resume What 's the point of all this Someone should probably explain it a little better than you 've done until today We did not expect miracles from this decree because we do not like demagogy However it is clear that the problems we face have distant origins and are the children of an energy policy in the sign of extreme environmentalism the consequence of which has been to make Italy totally not self sufficient and dependent on imports from abroad Someone will have to take responsibility for this Today we hear about the total blockade of Russian oil and gas We fully support the sanctions against Russia but what we do not want is that in order to hit Russia our companies will be affected and perhaps even sunk by them We therefore ask the Government not only to evaluate the possible alternatives to energy supply but also to reverse the trend that has so far seen us take out of our home what we could have from resources that our country is certainly not short of Italy risks paying a very high price indeed it is already paying it considering the families that do not arrive at the end of the third week of the month and will certainly not be able to rely on the umpteenth bonus that with this decree and with the next ones will be given Businesses are on their knees and some as you all know have also stopped production We believe that Europe cannot turn on the other side this time We need to review the policies of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan as we have said and said again and so many of you have said that they could not predict and have not predicted this new crisis due to the increase in raw materials and the war in Ukraine Similarly a new recovery fund is needed an energy recovery fund to support those countries indirectly affected by the consequences of the conflict On this we expect President Mario Draghi to put in place all his authority so that there will be a diplomatic escalation in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine The problem is that in order to deal with this emergency we would need a solid and less heterogeneous Government than there is with a clear vision of the country and the future everything that this Government obviously does not have The political forces that make it up do not agree with anything Just at a time when it would take a sense of responsibility all they do is pick up the Commission 's estate as we have seen today I have heard the President of the Budget Committee and some colleagues have asked if Senator Pesco has gone to the opposition I say this to indicate the holding of this majority As Brothers of Italy we were prophets in saying from the first day that this majority did not have too much way to go because it was and is too different to be together Time is gallant man and unfortunately things are right In conclusion we will continue to denounce everything that is happening as we are doing in recent years particularly with this de facto monocameralism Today we are faced with yet another vote of confidence on yet another decree coming to this House We will always make complaints loudly and we will raise our voice to tell Italy as a whole that while the country is struggling with the worst crisis since the post war period your priority is back to being a proportional electoral reform We are talking about this these days and it seems that the Democratic Party is even willing to bring this reform to the House You do this in order to find a way to guarantee you because only this can serve that armchair you did not want to separate from and that in any case in a few months you will have to leave since the legislature is now coming to an end We as Brothers of Italy do not fear the return to the polls nor strange electoral laws We will continue to call for a return to the vote as soon as possible because Italy deserves a strong government that is up to the situation and not a bunch of parties that are all and the opposite of everything and that not even an authoritative President of the Council has been able to lead,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,24.72286,-9.554105,28,mr president decree law fanciful title cuts prices would sincerely expected much especially italian companies

#CalandriniNicola,Minister this question arises on the basis of some of your statements to the press in recent days in which you have said that the superbonus has worked but it is drugging construction while there are other sectors that need to be followed such as automotive where the switch to electricity risks creating an explosion in terms of employment Certainly the scenario you set out is serious and worthy of attention but we do not quite understand the purpose Until now for twenty years now the car sector has always been used as an ATM by the State Now we seem to understand from his words that the automotive needs support but he cannot receive them because the superbonus has been introduced We do not think that this is the approach to be taken in this case The superbonus was a great opportunity for the construction sector proof of this is that it has favoured the birth of thousands of companies has facilitated the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs and has generated important revenues for the state 's coffers in terms of VAT Irpef Ires and IRAP which have come from those tax payments related to the thousands of yards opened in the past year You see Minister that is not what we say about Brothers of Italy but that is what authoritative studies of the sector and analyses made also by our parliamentary offices in the budget say We would not like his words to reveal the desire to favour a sector that rightly needs attention but to the detriment of another that has worked very well and that apart from the scams that have been there and that undoubtedly must be opposed by all means does not deserve the stop that is being imposed on him in these days since the decree law supports b with the umpteenth retroactive modification that only creates confusion uncertainty and restrains investment by honest entrepreneurs So Minister with this question of ours we ask you whether you can in any way give assurances about the initiatives that the Government intends to take to give certainty to this sector PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Economic Development Mr Giorgetti has the floor to answer the question which has just been put for three minutes,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,23.211023,-8.5441,28,minister question arises basis statements press recent days said superbonus worked drugging construction sectors need followed automotive switch electricity risks creating explosion terms employment certainly scenario set serious worthy attention quite understand purpose twenty years car sector always used atm state seem understand words automotive needs support cannot receive superbonus introduced think approach taken case superbonus great opportunity construction sector proof favoured birth thousands companies facilitated creation hundreds thousands jobs generated important revenues state 's coffers terms vat irpef ires irap come tax payments related thousands yards opened past year see minister say brothers italy authoritative studies sector analyses made also parliamentary offices budget say would like words reveal desire favour sector rightly needs attention detriment another worked well apart scams undoubtedly must opposed means deserve stop imposed days since decree law supports b umpteenth retroactive modification creates confusion uncertainty restrains investment honest entrepreneurs minister question ask whether way give assurances initiatives government intends take give certainty sector president debate minister economic development mr giorgetti floor answer question put three minutes
#CalandriniNicola,"Minister I do not share your answer at all because you refer to people who have EUR 300,000 or EUR 400,000 in income and to those who have the fourth or fifth homes In the meantime it does n't work that way because we stop at the main house and at most at the second house But I can also tell you that we spend EUR 10 billion on citizenship income so demagogy by demagogy let us try to tell ourselves clearly how things are We could use a lot of these sums for the subject we are dealing with today However regardless of these considerations your reply Minister does not convince us We have confidence that as far as the measure of the superbonus is concerned we have given answers to thousands of families and thousands of companies that represent the backbone of our country 's economic system We hope that the measure of the superbonus may no longer be changed since since it was introduced we have had 13 or 14 changes and that we can proceed with an orderly path that allows us to arrive at the natural expiry of these bonuses that as you know are imminent the sismabonus purchases will expire on 30 June while the superbonus of 110 percent will expire on 31 December 2022 for single family houses and 31 December 2023 for condominiums If we want to then it is a question of giving some legal certainty and avoiding the retroactivity of the rule I hope therefore that there will be a further recovery from the issue of superbonus",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,23.644627,-6.603562,28,"minister share answer refer people eur 300,000 eur 400,000 income fourth fifth homes meantime n't work way stop main house second house also tell spend eur 10 billion citizenship income demagogy demagogy let us try tell clearly things could use lot sums subject dealing today however regardless considerations reply minister convince us confidence far measure superbonus concerned given answers thousands families thousands companies represent backbone country 's economic system hope measure superbonus may longer changed since since introduced 13 14 changes proceed orderly path allows us arrive natural expiry bonuses know imminent sismabonus purchases expire 30 june superbonus 110 percent expire 31 december 2022 single family houses 31 december 2023 condominiums want question giving legal certainty avoiding retroactivity rule hope therefore recovery issue superbonus"
#CalandriniNicola,"Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President I would like to say at once that I agree with my colleague in the Budget Committee of the League who preceded me when he said that this DEF is too optimistic and does not actually look at the picture we have at the moment a pandemic that is still going on and a war at the gates of Europe Why do I say that ma'am Because the data contained in this document of economy and finance deviate significantly from reality As well as saying the League and Brothers of Italy the Parliamentary Budget Office which reported in black and white that this DEF which is based on the data of mid-March does not take account of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine believing that it would end in a very short time The social partners in all the hearings we have held these days have also judged this document very far from reality and with far too optimistic data The estimates of this document speak of a GDP growth of 2.9 percent other institutions such as Confindustria which are certainly not of our political side even foresee much smaller figures which are close to 2 There is no reason to doubt this analysis and not to start to fear the spectre of recession We do not like to say we said it because it is not a good thing but our leader Giorgia Meloni always said that the growth of 2021 was the result of a physiological rebound clearly due to a comparison with the year 2020 which was the hardest of the pandemic that our country suffered Today we can say that we were right because in the first three months of 2022 Banca d'Italia tells us that we have already lost half a point of GDP a sign that the policies put in place in recent years by the Governments Count I Count II and Dragons have served little and have been in some way frustrated by everything that has happened not only at the time when the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out but also in the previous months I refer to the dear bills the dear energy and the dear raw materials Clearly they have also been frustrated by the consequences of the conflict that has just broken out You see President the starting point for this DEF was certainly not the best The government put him in black and white in particular through the hearing of Minister Franco a few days ago always on the DEF Therefore in the light of developments related to the ongoing conflict the growth prospects are very weak compared to what was said and thought at the beginning of 2022 Clearly this has been heavily affected as I said earlier by the rise in raw material prices which has led to inflation splashing at almost 7 and this figure could also worsen even further if Russia had to come to a total blockade of natural gas inflows So if we do not solve the issue of commodity increases which is the real problem that we have today in Italy and therefore consequently the increase in inflation the purchasing power of families will be reduced creating additional pockets of poverty So this is the real issue which has not yet been dealt with in the present document The reality in short is that the present document lacks a political vision and an overall view of the country system We are in a difficult socio- economic context in which the pandemic emergency as I said earlier has been accompanied by these stratospheric increases in fuel energy and raw materials as well as last but not least the ongoing conflict The Brothers of Italy Group therefore strongly calls for a change from the recent past We do not talk about the budgetary deviation because we know that it is a very delicate very particular and very difficult deviation because it will produce additional debt but today it is inevitable that there will be another one that can bring lifeblood to the system of Italian companies and families The 10 billion euros released from the document of economy and finance under consideration are already committed because five have already been committed with the decree law that we will approve tomorrow in this House and five will commit them with the next decree- law which will in some way be issued by the government in the coming days The difference is that we commit EUR 10 billion and Germany is allocating EUR 100 billion to give aid to its businesses so that is 10 of what Germany allocates It will therefore be necessary to release additional resources in deficit it is inevitable So in addition to the deviation we will need Europe 's intervention and this will be very important for us Mr President we cannot therefore reason as we are doing because on the one hand we are talking about expensive fuel with a cover until the first days of May and on the system of bills we have reasoned quarterly We need a much broader broader political vision because it must structurally attack the problems we have in Italy today We therefore need a new governance of Europe and we need to review the rules of the game the rules of engagement because they are too opaque and too complex It must therefore be confirmed because it is a very important fact the speech on the safeguard clauses and therefore on the Stability and Growth Pact which is now at its standstill in 2022 We must make an effort and the authority of President Draghi must also serve to enable Europe to make this choice and to extend this period of time because it will be very important Mr President this commitment to go beyond 2022 will not be enough either because we hope that we will arrive at 2026 in order to free up the budgets of the State administration but also of the local authorities As I said this is not all we need but we need to go beyond this objective because we need to reduce the levels of debt not through the increase in taxes as the government wants to do with regard to the reform of the land register or the cut in social expenditure but by maintaining control of public expenditure this will be a matter of fundamental importance I am referring to that famous spending review that has disappeared from the political agenda of successive governments in recent years to magically reappear in this DEF We therefore take note of this and hope that from now on this type of instrument will be central to the policies of the Government In addition to talking about this new governance of Europe there are the increases that weigh heavily on Italian families it is even thought that there is an average of 2,000 euros per family For Italian companies it is estimated an increase of 188 billion euros for the purchase of goods or services All this could lead to a further contraction of national GDP therefore the embargo on Russian gas would be a coup d' grace as I said for our economy and this DEF says it clearly the sanctions already imposed on Russia albeit just weigh heavily on our economy On this we ask President Draghi to exercise all the authority he enjoys in the European institutions to ask for new support that is not in debt but compensate for the losses that countries are suffering indirectly from sanctions In the same way the National Recovery and Resilience Plan must also be revised which must necessarily change its orientation and be directed towards a plan that allows Italy to acquire its energy independence I shall conclude Mr President because I have no other time but I would like to say to President Draghi in particular that the theme is not to choose between peace and the heated air conditioners and from which we would have obviously expected other kinds of considerations the theme is to give the Italians the opportunity to choose between a government that lives in the day and one that has a political vision of the future of this country For this reason Brothers of Italy will abstain on the motion for a resolution on the deviation and instead vote against motion for a resolution No 1 on which the Government has expressed a favourable opinion",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#ArrigoniPaolo,Mr President thank you for the opportunity I 'll try again I said that on the front of energy security and relief from Russian gas the Government and Minister Cingolani are doing so much but on the front of the dear energy in the face of geopolitical events the instability of the markets and the difficulty of supplying gas in these days we also have the stop of supplying Russian gas through the North Stream and the abnormity and the unpredictability of gas price levels the situation is worrying and I fear that for autumn it will become dramatic The industry can't stand it anymore and above all it has no certainty Now the unknowns on the supplyings multiply For a few days some sellers have already informed their customers that given the price levels of electricity from 1 January 2023 they will terminate the supply contracts Added to this is the growing difficulty of large companies in defining gas supply contracts for the next thermal year since the main operators having difficulty finding it on the wholesale markets do not undertake to guarantee the contractual delivery of the gas On the basis of this some business associations I think of Assakarta have launched the alarm for the imminent closure of production facilities a drama for the economy and for employment I shall conclude by saying that we need much more for our energy Premier Draghi announced by the end of the month a new intervention with several billions Well the League is asking for it to be powerful financed also through a budgetary deviation also because it will have to counter the price levels of gas and electricity continuously rising in these days are nine times those of the pre-Covid years Today the single national price of electricity PUN is 446 euros per megawattora and 180 that of gas We are practically at double levels compared to the average prices of the first half of 2022 the quadruple compared to the average of 2021 Therefore if we do not intervene decisively we will have unsustainable costs for families and businesses even in the protected sector affecting the maintenance of the system The League as indicated in the motion that will be discussed next Thursday calls for the following measures to be extended and strengthened throughout the third quarter tax credits for energy purchases by companies obviously without the de minimis regime the cut in excise duties on fuels remember that ends on 2 August the zeroing of excise duties and the cut in VAT on gas for motor vehicles which has alarming prices which put at risk the existence of a supply chain the tax credit for the purchase of diesel and petrol for fishing agriculture and road haulage we also ask that new contributions be made for the municipalities which are in short supply and that at last 5 VAT be provided for indirect gas Premier Draghi is right to insist in Europe on the roof at the price of gas however if he ever succeeds in obtaining it from Europe it will be months longer and in the meantime we increase national gas production without delay to reduce our energy dependence including by amending the Plan for the sustainable energy transition of the suitable areas Pitesai Finally it is true that the superbonus is expensive It was inevitable that it would end this way too ambitious and not sustainable but today there are companies technicians and families that have started work and are stalled They 've been in debt mortgaged property and they 're failing I turn to Prime Minister Draghi and Minister Franco to give legal certainty we must give

#ArrigoniPaolo,Minister thank you for informing this House of the measures that the Government is about to take to secure our energy system more and more I want to start with the data too In 2001 Italy extracted 15 billion cubic metres of gas from national deposits representing 15 of total consumption which was then 71 billion We imported 20 billion cubic metres from Russia 28 percent of the total Twenty years later in 2021 last year zero kilometre gas extracted was reduced to 3.3 billion equivalent to just 4 of total consumption which in the meantime rose to 76 billion and last year we imported 29 billion cubic metres from Russia equivalent to 38 percent of the total These figures summarize the failure of years of Italian and European energy policy set at the bottom of everything No to nuclear was not enough no to coal no to drills no to TAP no to regasifiers no even to biomass and geothermal energy Politics in our country imbued with environmental ideologism has ignored the fundamentals Irregularly the foreign energy dependence of gas has risen in 20 years from 85 to 96 percent Instead of diversifying supplies we did the opposite by increasing imports of Russian gas Moreover in Italy as in Europe the advocates of green deal of push decarbonisation of Net Zero in 2050 have prevailed which has contributed with the ETS to raise energy prices However supporters of the ecological transition without fossils make no distinction between fuel oil coal and gas which is the least polluting of fossils And so for gas infrastructure for several years investments extractions and regasifiers have been blocked Until a few months ago even in the Senate by various political forces gas was considered absolute evil while it is exercising its strategic role of accompanying the ecological transition Yet who would go to fight the expensive bills someone had feared it in due time the League at the Copasir already in September 2020 asking and obtaining a cognitive survey on the energy system always the League during the preparation of the general lines of the PNRR I quote our comments as reflected in the final report on the PNRR proposal approved here in the Senate in March 2021 In a passage in relation to the development of renewables the Government was invited to take into account the following objectives to reduce the dependence of the country in terms of both energy and raw materials and diversify the sources of supply to reduce the cost of electricity and gas bills to strengthen the security and resilience of the country 's energy system with regard to plants networks and strategic reserves Evidently hairs fell into the void Now instead they all speak of energy autonomy of diversification of supplies after the dear energy has fallen like a tsunami that is overwhelming everyone and that risks to frustrate the economic recovery Compared to last year we are at crazy prices of electricity and gas which have increased six times The high level of energy which increasingly has structural characteristics is a phenomenon mainly European but Italy suffers much more because it pays for the questionable choices I have said and for a too small energy mix I remember that last year alone the average price of electricity in Italy was 30 higher than in Germany and 15 higher than in France We acknowledge the government 's intervention in the last few months with five measures allocating more than 17 billion to contain electricity and gas bills until the second quarter of this year But the measures are not enough the situation is unsustainable for many companies Much more needs to be done a budgetary deviation is now inevitable Meanwhile Europe after the Russian Ukrainian war to face the dear energy has updated the toolbox after the half empty one in October The Commission presented the RePower EU Some proposals are appreciable others do not convince us but better late than never Gas and nuclear integration into taxonomy is fine recognition of the role of gas in the transition is good We are now no longer talking about freeing Europe from gas but about freeing it from Russian gas It is the progress of pragmatism Care must be taken to accelerate too much the transition to clean energy with the prevalence of renewables photovoltaics and wind are not programmable because they produce only when there are sun and wind and represent a strong limit to the safety of the energy system and storage systems are far from being technologically ready developed and distributed on the territory I am concerned about the stability of the energy system in Sardinia where the Capacity market auction was assigned to a 500 megawatt accumulator The Government 's recipes for the gas emergency are positive both measures to increase short term security and measures to reduce and eliminate the dependence of imports from Russia as you indicated earlier Minister it contrasts speculation and pursues the withdrawal if there are extra profits of gas as already done for plants with renewable sources As a League always attentive to the issues of dear energy or the security of the energy system we ask you and the Government to do more I reiterate the need for a significant budgetary deviation to contain the dear bills It is not enough to extract more gas from authorized deposits alone We know that there is the Pitesai with too many constraints but we cannot continue to give our gas to Croatia or Greece We need to look for new gas fields at zero kilometres to increase our energy autonomy including to protect the environment since with the import one we emit many more climatic substances For the diversification of the supplyings we resume the plan of the EastMed gas pipeline able to bring to Italy natural gas from Israel We extend the energy mix to all renewables It is necessary to develop not only photovoltaic and wind they have strong limits of programmability but also geothermal biomass and especially hydropower which needs investment through demonstrations of public interest and not mere extensions that would for the third time be pallinated by the Constitutional Court We need more technological autonomy let us not close to the development of the latest generation of clean and safe nuclear power We must open a serious scientific and unprejudiced debate on the energy of the atom and reopen research on fission If by 2050 we want to seriously combat climate change and reduce CO2 emissions to zero if we want to respond to the growing demand for electrification if we have to deliver energy in a stable and continuous way and if we want to produce hydrogen at very low emissions to overcome gas know ladies and gentlemen that nuclear technology is the only one that will allow it Now we must also face the expensive fuels dear Minister As if the dear energy were not enough the crisis in Ukraine is exacerbating the expensive fuels that represent a further energy shock The critical situation on the international commodity markets has driven the prices of petrol and diesel which for several days have exceeded EUR 2.3 per litre With these unsustainable prices the field of road haulage is put in crisis it determines the block of numerous productive activities it will determine an ulterior increase of the prices of detail for many products of wide consumption creating a heavy damage to the economy of our Country There is no doubt that these prices are leading to a significant outcast for the state 's coffers estimated this year at over EUR 2 billion At this point it becomes necessary and the League has filed a motion to this effect for the Government to act as done by other European countries such as France Ireland Belgium and Poland who have deliberated measures to return tax extra-introductions bringing immediate benefits to citizenship We strongly call here in Parliament and in hundreds of municipal councils to intervene with an urgent temporary measure for the non-application of excise duty perhaps according to the so called mobile excise duty criterion or by introducing a reduced rate of VAT on fuel Minister Cingolani this

#ArrigoniPaolo,Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to thank Minister Cingolani for his comprehensive report in anticipation of the forthcoming meeting of the Energy and Environment Ministers of the G7 countries convened to establish a global alliance on ecological transition and sustainability We understand that the German Presidency intends to promote further emission reduction commitments compared to those already adopted at Cop26 in Glasgow Well if the anticipations are these there is a little to worry about especially if we are the only EU countries that are responsible for only 9 of CO2 emissions while China and India continue to be the major polluters I say this because we are well aware of the failure of years of the Italian European energy policy based on hyper challenging objectives and on the no to almost everything no to nuclear no to regasifiers no to drills no to TAP no to the thermo-energy plant in Rome In Europe and Italy in recent years for example we have disinvested in oil and gas thinking of protecting the environment instead we have made a disaster Gas consumption has remained similar prices have skyrocketed due to the surge in global gas demand and we pollute more because by importing gas more emissions are created Thus natural gas has overpowered its strategic role as a source of energy and as an accompaniment to the ecological transition and is sold dearly Compared to the pre-Covid period we are at crazy levels of gas prices and consequently electricity they have increased five times The high level of energy which increasingly has structural characteristics is a European phenomenon in particular But Italy suffers much more because it pays for the questionable choices I said above it pays for inefficiencies never resolved and for an energy mix too reduced High energy is also slowing down the ecological transition more coal is burning in Europe especially in Germany which would like to morale about emissions and not about nuclear power Against expensive energy we acknowledge that the Government has intervened in recent months with seven measures allocating a total of about 24 billion to contain bills of light and gas and expensive fuels Measures after the Russian Ukrainian crisis for gas emergency and measures to increase short term security and to reduce and eliminate the dependence of imports from Russia are also positive It wo n't be easy anyway I come to Europe and to the very recent Repower EU plan After the successful incorporation of gas and nuclear into taxonomy at the end of last year pragmatism in Brussels has made some progress In fact the role of gas in the transition has begun to be recognised Now we are no longer talking about freeing Europe from gas considered for too long the dark evil because it is a fossil but about freeing it from Russian gas After the Russian Ukrainian war in order to cope with expensive energy and to free itself from coal oil and Russian gas Brussels updated the toolbox after the half empty one in October and so the Commission last week presented the Repower EU plan The new objectives which have been raised compared to those already challenging and which are not acceptable to us in the Fit for 55 package leave us very perplexed We take note of the need to prolong the lives of coal and nuclear power stations and environmentalists will take it into account Illusory is instead the doubling of the objective of green hydrogen from 5 to 10 million tons per year There 's nothing yet There is no hydrogen market and above all there is little renewable electricity to produce it Too much emphasis then on the new 2030 energy efficiency target raised from 9 to 13 percent Question who pays the investment on existing buildings If we were to do it only with the superbonus the state would go bankrupt There is still too much emphasis on renewable energy with a target raised from 40 to 45 on final energy consumption We reiterate that the development of photovoltaics and wind they are not programmable and represent a strong limit to the security of the energy system will not be without the adaptation of the Terna transmission network and the development of the storage capacity which is still not available at an industrial level for which research is needed to develop technologies that do not make use of lithium in order to avoid tying us even more hands and feet to China With this in mind it is difficult to combine three energy policy objectives such as reducing emissions ensuring security of gas supply from other suppliers and containing energy prices There is a need for substantial investment A total economic support of 220 billion by 2027 is being envisaged in Europe with a loan mechanism such as the one created in response to Covid but how much would it be worth to Italy We know that Italy like Romania and Greece is among the countries that have already drawn on all the funds available for the National Recovery and Resilience Plan so we risk remaining dry Minister as a League always attentive to energy issues we make proposals that we ask you and the Government to take into account First of all it should be remembered that all the measures taken so far to contain expensive energy and expensive fuels are covered until 30 June on 8 July the excise duty on fuels and this is a big problem because the dear energy aggravated by the war has structural characteristics the Government will have to take another full measure within a month that will extend to the third quarter the measures to protect citizens businesses and economic recovery in the penalty of the crisis It will take several billions and it is likely that we will need a new intervention in debt a budgetary deviation that is a Community intervention in which Europe is called to play its part As far as gas is concerned all supply diversification measures are good for freeing themselves from Russia But above all we must reduce our high energy dependence also because Algeria Mozambique Angola Congo and Qatar themselves are not champions of democracy It is therefore okay to produce more biomethane but above all it is necessary to increase national gas production exploiting our deposits which Minister means more investment more employment more royalty for the territories and more environmental protection On sustainable mobility and decarbonisation of transport to combat climate change the enemy is CO2 not internal combustion cars The G7's objective of having all the new electric vehicles cars and zero emissions vans within the next decade is profoundly wrong Minister enforce the principle of technological neutrality All technologies contributing to decarbonisation including Euro 6 and Euro 7 must be supported We continue to develop biofuels synthetic fuels and LNG liquefied natural gas supply chains for heavy transport in addition to biomethane and hydrogen It is not only a question of protecting our automotive industry but also of protecting the environment as there is not all green energy Where is the charging infrastructure The electricity grid however cannot be easily adapted and then there will be no batteries or there will be another dependence on Asia with enormous geopolitical risks The circular economy must be closed in accordance with the principle of self sufficiency and territorial proximity Next then with the thermo-energy plant in Rome and with similar plants that are necessary The previous ones are measures for the short and medium term while we must have a view on the medium to long term So if we have to decarbonise in 2050 respond to the growing demand for electricity if we have to deliver energy continuously if we have to produce very low emission hydrogen considered a central element to overcome gas and if we have to reduce energy dependence we cannot avoid the development of the latest generation of clean and safe nuclear power Minister Cingolani and I have concluded we believe that these proposals of ours are important for the maintenance of the economic system of our country in a period of deep crisis and international instability Evaluate and

#PazzagliniGiuliano,"Minister with the Fit for 55 package formalized by the European Commission on 14 July 2021 with the aim of revising much of the current legislation on climate and energy the European Union has set itself the ambitious target of reducing emissions of newly registered cars by 55 by 2030 compared to 2021 and 100 by 2035 On the occasion of the information presented in Parliament with a view to the meeting of Energy and Environment Ministers of the G7 in Berlin last May Minister Cingolani reported on a strong commitment of the G7 countries to support decarbonisation in the transport sector as a significant contribution to the reduction of emissions in order to maintain the increase of the temperature within the degree and half centigrade The Minister reiterated the Italian position in favour of a rapid decarbonisation of the automotive sector but highlighted the need to identify diversified timing between light vehicles and heavy vehicles in order to allow an ambitious but just transition to national specificities regarding the development of the necessary infrastructure the adaptation of the production system to new technologies the importance of focusing also on other sustainable fuels and innovative technologies However with regard to the Fit for 55 package of measures the European Parliament at its recent meeting on 8 June 2022 approved the ban on the sale of internal combustion cars from 2035 as a priority contribution to the 55 reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 with a view to achieving the Union 's climate neutrality by 2050 as dictated by the European Green Deal Roadmap This will mean that in the immediate future only the sale of electric cars in Europe will be allowed considered by the EU a virtually exclusive solution to the sustainable transport of the Union demonstrating an ideological and demagogic approach to the ecological transition Given that the Italian automotive sector is worth 5.6 percent of national GDP and employs over 250,000 employees representing an excellence on the world scene also in terms of avant garde and technological innovation and therefore of environmental sustainability it is clear that the measure will result in an important alteration in the sector and in the economies of the countries Europe is still far from being independent of non-EU economies as regards the availability of raw materials their ability to transform and create all the components necessary for the construction of the vehicle Since I believe that my time is running out I come directly to the question It is asked to know which measures the Minister in address intends to put in place at national and European level to counter the ideological approach undertaken by the EU to achieve climate neutrality through drastic and utopian measures in the field of electric automotive one of the main national excellences and to promote a true sustainable ecological transition in the short and long term allowing with a gradual approach the holding of the country 's economic system in achieving the ambitious goals of climate neutrality of the EU responding to the commitment of the Minister

#PazzagliniGiuliano,"Mr Minister I agree with everything you have said partly because I have said the same things several times in the past but I cannot say that I am completely satisfied with the answer because on the point that was a priority for me that is to say the employment and rescue of our national industry in fact it did not say anything at all Previously when I spoke of 5,6 of GDP I was obviously only referring to what comes directly from the sector then if we were to talk about induced we would get higher figures This clearly can only be a priority With regard to the criterion of technological neutrality I claim its birthright in the political debate because as soon as the Draghi Government was born in the Environment Commission I pointed out that being a very heterogeneous majority the only common sense approach not dogmatic nor ideological but exclusively of common sense was precisely technological neutrality an approach that in reality did not exist In our intentions yes we all probably share it but then in reality especially in European politics that is not the case I would therefore ask you again Minister since you have just said that you share this suggestion that I had allowed myself to move forward to the Environment Commission a year and a half ago to continue strongly to support it because as you said earlier there are technological alternatives but we will not save the environment by preventing the possibility of science which is proving that precisely these alternatives are there Let us put the problem as a policy but let us leave it to science to find the answer only in this way can we be sure that we will do what we can to improve the situation",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,24.983643,-12.468624,28,"mr minister agree everything said partly said things several times past cannot say completely satisfied answer point priority say employment rescue national industry fact say anything previously spoke 5,6 gdp obviously referring comes directly sector talk induced would get higher figures clearly priority regard criterion technological neutrality claim birthright political debate soon draghi government born environment commission pointed heterogeneous majority common sense approach dogmatic ideological exclusively common sense precisely technological neutrality approach reality exist intentions yes probably share reality especially european politics case would therefore ask minister since said share suggestion allowed move forward environment commission year half ago continue strongly support said earlier technological alternatives save environment preventing possibility science proving precisely alternatives let us put problem policy let us leave science find answer way sure improve situation"
#PepePasquale,Mr President undersecretary Gava ladies and gentlemen the high prices in this case the high prices relating to the cost of energy and gas are making itself felt heavily on Italian households and at the same time is holding back growth On the one hand it puts families in difficulty and on the other it prevents those who do business from moving forward growing and developing Yesterday 's forecast by the International Monetary Fund that GDP in Italy in the current year will be around 2.3 unlike last year when it stood at 6.6 One of the causes that determines this discrasia in negative is the energy dependence of Italy from other countries This is an issue as happens in other areas which policy must address as is happening from two points of view firstly from the point of view of contingency and secondly from the perspective and the future What has been done about contingency A measure has been taken to limit the increase in the cost of energy and gas for households businesses and local authorities with an important allocation As far as we are concerned it is likely that if we need another budget this Government and this Parliament will only be able to act in this direction On the other hand what should be done in perspective We must speak frankly and radically change the approach to what has been until recently Enough with ideology enough with no enough with senseless fears enough with irresponsible attitudes We must move forward with common sense and pragmatism in the interests of our country first and foremost We must exploit natural resources where there are we must have common sense and the responsible approach to taking advantage of the discoveries of science and technology at the same time we must have the courage to diversify sources Renewable Yes absolutely yes but we need to accompany the energy transition Europe says so not just us bad ligistics with the latest generation of gas and nuclear power This is an inevitable route except that someone does not want to imagine that instead of our beautiful country there is the wonderful panorama of Heidi and the grandfather of Heidi There is also another important aspect It has been considered the forecast of the import of gas but as far as we are concerned certainly noteworthy attention must also be given to the production of gas within our own country What is achieved by this pragmatic responsible and common sense approach We support families who can grow and be founded with serenity and safety because if we rely on technology we do not put at risk either the health of people or the health of the environment around us Businesses are supported which can benefit from a new shift in pace and pace thanks to the prospect of a new technology We must also give concrete support here too to the municipalities because if they are not supported from the point of view of the cost of energy gas and not only they will inevitably have to struggle for a lower quality of services and there will be an inevitable increase in taxes on citizens And we cannot and must not allow that today I would like to make another reflection on renewable energy We know I know from direct experience that there are countless disputes between those who have put up renewable energy plants and the GSE in some cases and the Revenue Agency in other cases A hypothesis that cannot be overlooked is to look carefully at these disputes and to consider putting in place a measure that either suspends them or cancels them completely or at least revises the chapter of sanctions and interests In fact we have already existing plants which are blocked by these disputes and which could so much give Italy in terms of lower costs and greater renewable energy Then we have the bureaucracy With this decree law an important step forward has been taken there has been an acceleration but it is not enough We know that in some ways Italy attracts investment from the point of view of renewable energies but at the same time what blocks them or even rejects them is the length of the technical administrative procedures of our country It is a field challenge and is the most important if you really want to move on Today what is happening in Puglia and specifically in Taranto The first offshore wind power plant is inaugurated which is authorized and whose tape is cut sixteen years after the project is presented it is something unacceptable and incomprehensible especially at a time like this Some regions need to be given a look at There are some that have natural resources they already have opportunities for the hands on which they have direct ownership and on some events they do not even have to wait for the intervention of the state I urge these regions to immediately make available to their citizens economic resources or natural resources such as gas because people cannot and must no longer wait What has happened in these two years The world has changed because there has been a pandemic because there is a war going on at the gates of Europe and because priorities have changed and politics must live up to this change that there has been so abruptly Politics cannot give up it must not fall back on itself but it must re-launch in our view on the basis of two essential aspects On the one hand the mistakes of the past must no longer be committed One of these mistakes is that obtuse populist irresponsible and senseless environmentalism that has stopped the country for too long We can no longer repeat these mistakes To be clear it is that environmentalism that it is an example of many is manifesting itself in the Adriatic Sea where from the same basin there is Croatia pulling gas and Italy that for this ideology does not pull anything On the other hand the strength is the courage of new ideas avant garde ideas and concrete actions Today is the birthday of Rome and to this city I address I imagine on behalf of all a deep and heartfelt wish Yesterday the mayor of Rome Gualtieri debunked this taboo of obtuse environmentalism senseless and irresponsible and announced that by 2025 he will realize a thermo-valuer for the city of Rome It took a huge pile of waste and perhaps the energy crisis to convince the mayor to do this We learn this news so favorably also because I want to remember that there is no greater victory than seeing your adversary 's mouth shine your truth This happened today in Rome and we hope that it will happen throughout the country with courage with vision with responsibility in the interest of all Italians after having definitively archived an ideology that has never had a sense of existence and that today even more has no sense that it continues to

#deBertoldiAndrea,Mr. Minister unfortunately I must declare the absolute dissatisfaction with an answer that I feared but that I hoped could change There is no objective reason and I say this again Minister to persevere in error You are persevering and you are doing this in front of 60 million Italians in the error of predicting limitations to the sale of the credit which are of no use because in the superbonus 110 fraud is practically reduced to zero At a time when there is a visa of conformity where the professionals who apply it are insured and therefore liable to the State there is no risk of fraud The limits to the sale of credits lead to a single result Minister to paralyse the market Today the ceiling is sold out Poste buys only from private individuals and the main national banks have exhausted the tax capacity and do not buy I 'm asking you to really think For the good of the Italians put an end to the absurd limitation in the transfer of tax credits,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,22.06661,-10.638748,28,mr. minister unfortunately must declare absolute dissatisfaction answer feared hoped could change objective reason say minister persevere error persevering front 60 million italians error predicting limitations sale credit use superbonus 110 fraud practically reduced zero time visa conformity professionals apply insured therefore liable state risk fraud limits sale credits lead single result minister paralyse market today ceiling sold poste buys private individuals main national banks exhausted tax capacity buy 'm asking really think good italians put end absurd limitation transfer tax credits
#CirianiLuca,CIRIANI FdI Mr President I am speaking on Amendment No 1.12 because for many weeks now Parliament and the Government have been engaged in the debate on tax delegation We have read dozens of very demanding and very hard statements from representatives of the majority parties who said that the house is not touched because it is the fruit of the sacrifice and savings of the Italians It has been clearly stated that any hypothesis even theoretical of increasing cadastral values is not acceptable and not even conceivable It has been said and pointed out on our part Mr President that the increase in cadastral values and the reform of the land register do not only affect the value of housing but are likely to exclude hundreds of thousands of families from the social benefits linked to the values of the ISEE Clearly in fact if a person or a family has the misfortune because this is the case of having a house owned the result of many sacrifices the cadastral revaluation also produces an increase for the purposes of ISEE in addition to the damage the mockery In the end however the moment of truth always comes in life and also in politics Mr President ladies and gentlemen this is exactly the moment of truth We have the opportunity not to announce to the newspapers but to vote pragmatically now at this time in this House a commitment to the government to cancel that reform from the political programme we also have the possibility to say that that reform is a scam that we cannot say that we are doing the reform but we will not apply it because not even a child believes it So now we of Brothers of Italy have made a commitment to call to accountability and transparent decisions all parties There is no possibility of escape either we vote in favour or we vote against Everyone will then assume their responsibilities,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,22.348307,-4.431615,28,ciriani fdi mr president speaking amendment 1.12 many weeks parliament government engaged debate tax delegation read dozens demanding hard statements representatives majority parties said house touched fruit sacrifice savings italians clearly stated hypothesis even theoretical increasing cadastral values acceptable even conceivable said pointed part mr president increase cadastral values reform land register affect value housing likely exclude hundreds thousands families social benefits linked values isee clearly fact person family misfortune case house owned result many sacrifices cadastral revaluation also produces increase purposes isee addition damage mockery end however moment truth always comes life also politics mr president ladies gentlemen exactly moment truth opportunity announce newspapers vote pragmatically time house commitment government cancel reform political programme also possibility say reform scam cannot say reform apply even child believes brothers italy made commitment call accountability transparent decisions parties possibility escape either vote favour vote everyone assume responsibilities
#TosatoPaolo,Mr President I would like to thank the Minister for his reply The interrogators and the League Group are pleased with the Government 's response Thank you and unlike those who preceded me I did not catch propaganda in his words but concrete answers useful for the common good The manufacturing and industrial sector is fundamental for the growth and well being of a country as you said in a previous intervention Companies located in mountain and foothill territories must be defended representing a fundamental outlet for the employment of young people in those territories The alternative is the abandonment of one 's own land in search of fortune elsewhere starting from big cities or abroad for those who have the opportunity The effects of the pandemic the dear energy and the lack of raw materials are seriously jeopardising the maintenance of Italy 's production system already in crisis in many sectors for reasons of competitiveness The Government and Parliament have a duty to deal with this difficult situation with great commitment and unity of intent We are pleased that in the case of the historic company in Belluno the Minister is succeeding in achieving the comforting results because the salvation of every single job means saving a family from deep economic social and personal crises The task assigned to you is burdensome but we are sure that the Ministry of Economic Development is in very good hands The League Group will always be at your side and that of the Government in the front line to defend companies and jobs We still believe that Italy belongs to the culture of work we are convinced that Italy cannot abandon its vocation as an industrialised country Each of us must play our part in this direction At this difficult stage we could not stand on the sidelines and watch and criticize what others did or did not do it would only be a convenient position Others have made this choice we have chosen a more difficult path for us but more useful to the country We thank you Minister and we are pleased that the families of ACC Compressor workers can look to the future with greater hope,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,23.224037,-8.734213,28,mr president would like thank minister reply interrogators league group pleased government 's response thank unlike preceded catch propaganda words concrete answers useful common good manufacturing industrial sector fundamental growth well country said previous intervention companies located mountain foothill territories must defended representing fundamental outlet employment young people territories alternative abandonment one 's land search fortune elsewhere starting big cities abroad opportunity effects pandemic dear energy lack raw materials seriously jeopardising maintenance italy 's production system already crisis many sectors reasons competitiveness government parliament duty deal difficult situation great commitment unity intent pleased case historic company belluno minister succeeding achieving comforting results salvation every single job means saving family deep economic social personal crises task assigned burdensome sure ministry economic development good hands league group always side government front line defend companies jobs still believe italy belongs culture work convinced italy cannot abandon vocation industrialised country us must play part direction difficult stage could stand sidelines watch criticize others would convenient position others made choice chosen difficult path us useful country thank minister pleased families acc compressor workers look future greater hope
#TosatoPaolo,Mr President the document on economics and finance is certainly an important step towards the end of year budgetary law It is an important step because it analyzes the health situation of the public accounts analyses macroeconomic data and basically sets out the path of our country to arrive to define a fiscal law that is useful to the growth of our economy in a period of great concern of great stagnation and of great difficulty I believe that it is difficult to define a DEF this year as a reliable forecast because there are many elements of uncertainty that obviously affect these forecasts All of us have spoken in this debate and we are repeating the same concerns well or badly we are talking about energy costs the cost of raw materials and also the difficulty of finding raw materials to feed our production system we are talking about the cost of fuels and also about the crisis in finding food resources which is not yet so obvious but which could be real in the coming months Then there is the trend of war which is absolutely unpredictable and the consequences it will have on the economy of Italy Europe and the whole world It must also be considered the most worrying figure of this beginning of the year which is inflation an inflation out of control never so high that does not even appear so credible in the estimates of ISTAT which seem optimistic compared to the reality lived by our families by our country system We therefore believe that the DEF in question inevitably makes not necessarily reliable forecasts and in our view also quite optimistic We understand that the government should not give rise to concern in public opinion in families with respect to the productive system that must have confidence to continue producing working investing and spending This is right but we hope that the Government will have the perception of the gravity of the situation because this debate does not seem to be related to the reality that our country is experiencing There 's a bigger economic emergency than the one caused by Covid Europe has reacted quickly and effectively in the management of that emergency today it seems slower more uncertain again divided for example in establishing a roof at the price of gas Let us return to the interests of the individual nations that make up the European Union Even on the use of the measure of budgetary deviation it is obvious that if Italy used it autonomously the spread would grow and there would be a negative impact on the credibility of the Italian public accounts with serious consequences We need joint action from Europe but it is not yet coming The government is asking for great sacrifices in these months to the Italian people in order to face the emergency that we are experiencing but it must face this crisis with the same courage and determination It seems to us that our government is not quick and quick in decisions There is not enough money for a few billion to slow down the increase in energy and fuel costs They are palliative they seem to be good intentions but they do not face the gravity of the moment in a structural way It is clear that the economic situation is dramatic that the costs are unsustainable for families and for productive activities despite the almost 20 billion allocated by the Government These are important and enormous appropriations and we appreciate the effort made by the Commission and the majority united in supporting these measures That 's a lot a lot of 20 billion but alas it 's absolutely not enough There are very worrying signs When there are steel mills paper mills and strategic sectors of our industrial system that suspend production it is not just a wake up call it is a situation that risks degenerating because the entire production chain suffers from these industrial production suspensions Unfortunately the Government has been able to and has been able to give only partial answers with substantial appropriations in the amount but absolutely insufficient and inadequate to be effective We therefore ask the Government not to lower its guard and to intervene more decisively The budgetary deviation today is not an option but a necessity and of course this decision must be taken at European level it cannot be Italy alone that takes on this responsibility We therefore ask the Government to succeed in obtaining a chance in this direction before the system jumps because the time factor is also crucial if we wait too long companies and activities will close one after the other without the possibility of reopening once the crisis ceases Today we need a similar reaction to what Europe was able to put on the ground when the Covid emergency occurred with important appropriations The danger of a social crisis as many colleagues have said is at the door There is a fire under the ashes there is a situation of apparent calm in the country but the suffering of many and too many Italian families who are unable to pay and honor their debts is at the limit People and families who have always been good taxpayers today are no longer able to do so because the energy gas and fuel costs as we have said are so high that even medium sized salaries are absolutely inadequate to withstand this collapse So let 's be careful because if the fire hatches under the ashes the fire could flare up at any moment the social rebellion could rise at any moment This debate risks being surreal too far from the very serious reality that our country is experiencing The effects of the war were devastating highlighting first of all the wrong choices made by Italy in the past Energy dependence and strategic sectors have made us weak and fragile Maybe we all thought that the opposition and the cold war were behind us and in this we were probably wrong just as we were wrong in thinking that there was a global market for which the surplus of production of certain goods in some areas of the planet could feed our industry and our needs With regard to war which is a very delicate subject on which many reflections can be made the faults are clear and evident those of Putin who wanted to open this conflict However we must ask ourselves whether this conflict could be avoided what role has the European Community played and what role Italy has played especially what role it wants to play today We are convinced that it is wrong to throw gasoline on the fire It is wrong for world leaders to feed this conflict with their own words It is necessary to seek a way of peace because only at the end of this war can we return to normal The return to the Cold War is certainly not good for Europe and it is not good for Italy We must be protagonists at European level in the healing of ongoing conflicts and in returning to a normal situation involving the removal of those walls and barriers A normality that has allowed us to have greater peace on our planet and also the possibility of positive trade for all world economies This must be our objective beyond all other considerations Therefore we hope that the Government will be clear about the seriousness of the situation and that it will allocate the resources necessary to avoid an economic collapse which risks being devastating and cannot be overcome by our economy and Italian

#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President this amendment by Brothers of Italy proposes the introduction of tax treatment to the family in proportion to the number of its members with modulations for the spouse the first the second and the third children This is what is known as a family quotient The birth rate has been steadily falling for thirteen years during which a negative record has been recorded each year for a number of reasons that are not just economic Where you can intervene is here We really need a jump and a strong change in this respect Small measurements or even facades are not enough We have already seen that the famous universal single family allowance beautiful thing especially in the title is not actually universal and in many cases we speak of hundreds of thousands of families perhaps millions means having less than before We need strong measures not these measures Today a family a couple or even single parents with children receive from the State in terms of deductions and benefits much less than what they have to pay in terms of VAT alone on what they have to buy for children It must also be considered that a family with children needs a bigger car also because not all Italians live in the ZTL where maybe everything is within reach of a short walk and a larger house which is then calculated to establish the income ISEE Therefore one risks getting out of these parameters because having a family composed for example of four instead of two people one needs larger spaces It can not be said that there is no money because as Senator Pillon said well if we lack resources for our future i.e. children who are the adults of tomorrow why should we use them for other things Is it more right to support families with children or find billions to give Benetton for the highway business Just in these days the Ministry of Sustainable Infrastructure and Mobility has signed a document with which Autostrade for Italy is refunded to 100 of the missed collections cause Covid while we know very well that thousands of companies have received 6 1 or 10 percent Is it better to find money for children or for the income of citizenship with all its crooks such as the incentive not to work Is it better to find 5 or 10 euros a day even less with a family quotient for families or find 200 euros a day for children who are taken away from families and given to family homes In many cases these are justified acts but in many others we see the consequences in phenomena such as that of the Bible Unfortunately there is not only Biblical but there are hundreds thousands of cases that the parliamentary committees also deal with If you do n't find the money for these things and find them for much more it means that our future is not what we would like Instead Brothers of Italy wants our future to be based on families who have children and who can raise them in serenity and not in narrowness Today the difference between those who have children and those who do not have children with a low average income is between living discreetly and having really enormous difficulties to get to the end of the month This can not be tolerated,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#BalboniAlberto,"Balboni FdI Madam President Madam Minister the situation of justice in Italy is dramatic It is not from today and it is certainly not because of its responsibility but the inefficiency and delays of justice as we all know you too have made a brief mention of it cost in economic terms Just think that if the duration of Italian justice were comparable to the European average it is estimated that this would produce 130,000 more jobs and we know how important it would be for Italy to have more opportunities for work But above all this would be an important driver for investment from abroad because we know that unfortunately the issue of justice is one of the main obstacles to investment from abroad in Italy you mentioned that too However the situation is now as dramatic as it was a year ago Minister Of course there have been difficult moments due to the emergency from Covid 19 but the situation is still the same more than 1.5 million criminal trials and more than 3.1 million pending civil trials We even have a spending on unjust detention that exceeds EUR 27 million per year a thousand people every year end up in prison as innocent people in protective custody A third of the inmates are awaiting trial We rightly complain about overcrowding in prisons but one out of every three prisoners in prison today is not a convicted person These are issues Minister which you must deal with more decisively I understand that yours is such a large majority that it contains everything and the opposite of everything and unfortunately this often and willingly brings down compromises The reforms you mentioned in your report are down Minister You are a jurist and you cannot help but realize that in order to keep everything together and the opposite of everything in the end you can find absolutely inadequate solutions You made a reference and I do n't want to subtract On the reform of the prescription you to please this and that have created a hybrid that there is only in Italy you have put together a substantial institute like the prescription up to the judgment in the first degree and then in order not to displease the 5 Stars you have invented the procedural prescription But this Minister will have an effect contrary to what you wish It is clear in fact that a judge of first instance who knows that he has for example seven and a half years to issue a judgment for fraud does not pose the problem of allowing the judge of second or third degree to conclude the trial in the time of the prescription because in appeal the prescription is no longer there there will simply be imprecedibility So on the one hand you will lengthen the times of the first degree of judgment and on the other hand you will encourage the appeal because everyone will appeal in the hope of benefiting then from the procedural prescription that is from impeccability Here is an example for which the compromise for a sort of heterogeneous purpose produces the opposite result to what you say you want to pursue The same applies in the civil process Minister you who are a jurist are well aware that putting too early foreclosures and insurmountable barriers violates the principle of contradictory because it prevents the question of the parties to be completely distorted you also know however that when two parties end up before a judge they do not have to solve just one issue matters are becoming increasingly complicated As the United Chambers Supreme Court has also pointed out foreclosures too early prevent the bringing into that process all the issues involving those parties This means that you earn three four or five months in that trial but you will often force those same parties to a second a third or a fourth trial to resolve all the events that exist between them Do you see how sometimes unfortunately not having a cohesive majority that goes all in the same direction leads to paradoxical results such as these Certainly in the reforms that we have made there are also positive aspects of course There has been talk from several parts of the family court we have supported it and there was indeed our proposal for a law in this sense to which you have drawn widely and we are happy and satisfied with this As for the criminal I think of the presumption of innocence alive God finally Finally there are criteria for referral back to court which refer not to the justification of the trial but to the reasonable prediction of conviction less bad But then unfortunately the situation of justice in Italy has resulted and leads to a fall in the confidence of the Italians in the administration of justice because there is not only an economic issue about which I have already briefly spoken but there is also a theme of feeling of justice which today is regularly trampled on There have been dramatic examples in this House unworthy of a civilized country like ours of people who after ten years and after an acquittal at first instance are condemned on the basis of the same identical evidence for which they had been acquitted and who in order to save their honour see no other way out than suicide This is also today unfortunately justice in Italy Minister you rightly said in a passage from your speech that we must rebuild the confidence of Italians in justice and then if you want to do so do so Reformed as the CSM should this electoral system of multiple preferences with decreasing weight will be the triumph of currents and not their elimination We need the draw at extreme evils extreme remedies if we want to eradicate completely the current degeneration which has emerged from the scandals that everyone is unfortunately talking about Then we must intervene upstream or downstream but we find the system we need the draw Enough with the revolving doors between the judiciary and politics and finally take the courage to get to the separation of careers Madam Minister there is a medieval privilege unworthy of a rule of law for which judges have absolute immunity I refer to the civil liability of judges We should rather talk about irresponsibility because even in the extreme case in which a magistrate gets to answer for the damages he caused with malice or gross negligence although all Italians respond with their assets from the damage they cause the magistrate only responds within the limit of six months of his salary Is n't that a shame Minister how can the Italians think of being protected if the judge is immune and enjoys a medieval privilege There would obviously be many other things to talk about such as the honorary judiciary trampled on and humiliated with an amendment that not all political forces have shared We have not shared this and the blackmail must remain in the minutes so that an honorary magistrate who submits an application for stabilisation shameful because you equalize them with the administrative staff at the time when he submits the application must renounce all claims relating to rights which have been trampled on in the ten twenty or thirty years of exercise of his profession If a private entrepreneur did it with one of his workers the next day he would be on trial for extortion and you put him in a law",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,19.63612,-9.995268,28,"balboni fdi madam president madam

#AlessandriniValeria,Minister I am not satisfied with your reply and I explain why It is the duty of politics to intervene when the money of the Italians is spent which should be invested in a moment of crisis like this one to give answers Good morning can be seen from the morning Definitely this platform started with an intent but it started late almost at the end of the pandemic and certainly did not prove to be up to the Italian sector of culture which is a world excellence There have been and have emerged as you said before of the naiveties let us call them so management Of course the offer was n't competitive and did n't even include an agreement with RaiPlay on the cost of the films We are seeing what the Italian situation is there will be some restrictions in the autumn with the cinemas that continue to close and that are forced to fire their employees with artists and underpaid workers I find this unacceptable because the serious thing is that millions of euros of Italian taxpayers have been wasted unnecessarily We will continue to watch hoping there will be a reversal of the march As it has been managed so far I would ask you to consider closing the platform and using the funds to give answers and act as an economic flywheel for the cultural and tourism sectors because we know that they often have little money at their disposal,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,19.83603,-8.704841,28,minister satisfied reply explain duty politics intervene money italians spent invested moment crisis like one give answers good morning seen morning definitely platform started intent started late almost end pandemic certainly prove italian sector culture world excellence emerged said naiveties let us call management course offer n't competitive n't even include agreement raiplay cost films seeing italian situation restrictions autumn cinemas continue close forced fire employees artists underpaid workers find unacceptable serious thing millions euros italian taxpayers wasted unnecessarily continue watch hoping reversal march managed far would ask consider closing platform using funds give answers act economic flywheel cultural tourism sectors know often little money disposal
#AlessandriniValeria,ALESSANDRINI L- SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen Senators Minister the bill that we are going to vote on which delegates to the Government for the support and enhancement of the family provides for the adoption of measures to support parenthood and aims to help families and young couples who want to move away from the original core to build their own life plan to start flying with their wings towards the future A future that politics has a duty to protect and support It is a starting point which emphasizes the family theme We need to do much more and it is essential to work in this direction to achieve measures that really improve the lives of families In Italy the family theme is central both from a cultural and social point of view We are in fact one of the countries in which this aspect is stronger and more distinctive The family is the fundamental social nucleus and is the basis of our educational and training system the Constitution itself affirms its value and the need for protection Despite the centrality recognized culturally socially and constitutionally to the early social formation in which the individual develops the family in recent years has been debased by a unique thought which someone has tried to impose A unique thought that tried to distort it and make it less and less central In Italy the legislation that protection is completely inadequate and our feeling often runs counter to a legal system that does not support it as it should We consider this measure to be a first step in trying to adapt legislation to the social changes that have been going on for a long time The family itself has changed over the years along with society Unfortunately legislation has not been updated and has remained anchored to a self managing family model where roles were well defined The present family has different needs and its members have legitimate aspirations far from those of the past and politics has the task of intervening in favor of its development We here have a duty to do so a duty which is dictated to us by Article 31 of the Constitution when it states The Republic shall facilitate with economic measures and other provisions the training of the family and the performance of the related tasks with particular regard to large families It protects motherhood childhood and youth encouraging the institutions necessary for this purpose The draft law in question the so called family act includes measures that are part of the reforms provided for by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan intended for families with children and in order to promote the parenthood and the social and educational function of families to combat denatality to enhance the harmonious growth of girls and children promoting the financial autonomy of young people and the reconciliation of family life with work in particular women It is only the first step in a path that we hope will lead to measures that really help households Denatality amplified in an exponential way also by the Covid epidemic is a problem that can no longer be neglected It is a phenomenon that for the dimensions reached needs a clear and concrete intervention from the Government That is what we expect and ask We must put young people in a position to have children and we have a duty to ensure that their family desire is not opposed by the uncertainty of tomorrow We must do so by means of rules that allow working mothers to continue to work so that they no longer have to choose between the desire to become mothers and the desire to become mothers professionally Unfortunately reconciling work with the care of children involves a review of the times a reorganization of one 's life and priorities and this is difficult Not rarely does a high percentage of women leave their jobs after giving birth to a child Policies are needed to reconcile these two aspects of a woman 's life flexible leave and work organization measures which encourage women to return to work after maternity We cannot allow a new mom to be forced to give up her job This must be one of our objectives and our action must be aimed at achieving it It is essential for us to create a path of rules that really and concretely help young people who want to create their own family facilitating their economic and social independence We believe that it is the task of the State to intervene by providing services that can help parents to face the phase after the birth of a child which represents a radical change in the life of a man and a woman Contributions are needed to cover the costs to be borne by new parents for kindergartens and infancy schools We also hope that the services that support families with home services will be activated for those who have children or children under six years of age Both parents must be placed in a position to continue working and cannot be restrained in their aspirations by the construction of their dream of life We consider the birthday a great defeat for our country and we have always fought to support parenting Action is also needed to promote greater equality within the family Family roles must be complementary and interchangeable This would allow the mother to continue her work and not give up her legitimate career expectations The rules must change together with society and the needs of the people to whom they are addressed What has been done so far with the universal single cheque is a first approach to solving the problem but it is not enough The universal single grant on the one hand simplifies the procedure of access to the measure deburring it making it more streamlined and simplified on the other hand however it does not fully satisfy families especially the larger ones It is therefore only the beginning of a path in which the League wants to be an active part We believe that the direction taken is the right one but much more needs to be done The family act contains a series of provisions that try to respond to needs in a broad and integrated way grasping the necessarily complex and multidimensional aspects of the problems that affect our country related to the denatality and ability of families to support their children The negative trend must be reversed as soon as possible with incisive interventions aimed at combining parenthood with the working prospects of both parents We must allow couples to bring forth children without fear of the future Some of the measures included in the text go in this direction On this occasion too I would like to stress that our objective is to protect all families with children not excluded We hope that there will be no more serious families and families of series b and that all workers regardless of the activities they carry out will have access to the facilities provided for those who bring a child into the world Common sense therefore invites us to extend the rules on parental leave also to self employed workers with specific measures that assess the needs and peculiarities of the various professions giving them the same opportunities and the same protection as employees It is also desirable to encourage employers involved in the implementation of policies that harmonise private and professional life and promote the conjugation of these two aspects which are equally important and fundamental to the lives of each individual Using the instrument of flexible work agile work teleworking and smart working for mothers and fathers in the post birth period and in the first months and years of the child 's life is definitely a good start to meet the needs of those who want to create a family As a Group we agree with the Government which has already expressed its support by accepting an agenda which is shared by the whole Commission I would like to thank our President and rapporteur Mrs Matrisciano for this and also for the way in which she has carried out the work We agree on the opening of a technical working table on the drafting of the implementing decrees in order to ensure the widest possible involvement of the institutional actors concerned so that the rules are balanced on the real needs of the users of the measures and facilities The table is a useful means of comparison that we hope will give substance and concreteness to the intentions of the extensors of the bill in question The measures contained in this measure are urgent Senator Pillon has already spoken about the issue of the ISEE and the current calculation mechanism which is not appropriate Because of a sense of responsibility towards Italians towards those in clear economic difficulty and towards what we are here to represent it is certainly necessary to proceed quickly and as happened in the House we also show in this House that we really care about the needs of citizens and their future For all these reasons I announce the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Group

#LunesuMichelina,"LUNESU L SP PSd Az Mr President today in this House we are going to take that long awaited step forward the third reading of the bill of popular initiative so that islands such as Sardinia and Sicily can be recognised as the natural disadvantage of insularity and introduce the necessary measures to ensure effective equality and real enjoyment of inalienable individual rights which was eliminated in 2001 as has already been said with the reform of Title V I would like to thank the President of the Senate 's Committee on Constitutional Affairs Senator Parrini and his members for giving a favourable opinion on the text Today 's vote which I hope will be unanimous will follow the last passage to the House that if it happens within the summer will soon lead us to the expected finish line Dear President kind senators you cannot imagine how important it is for us Sardinians to approve this bill which adds the following paragraph to Article 119 The Republic recognises the peculiarity of the Islands and promotes the measures necessary to remove the disadvantages of insularity There are several essential points I would like to mention Among these I quote the extension to all territorial authorities and not only to the Regions as currently envisaged the autonomy of income and expenditure so that they enjoy autonomous resources and can fix and apply their own taxes and revenues the application for state law the establishment of an equalisation fund absent in the previous text is consistent with the logic of fiscal decentralisation in which the territories are responsible in the choices of expenditure and in the related decisions for their financing intervention of support of territories in which revenues are not adequate and is therefore a reason for less development less growth measured by the lower fiscal capacity and not by the administrative inefficiency of the territorial body additional state resources special interventions in favour of those entities in order to pursue one of the following aims to promote economic development cohesion and social solidarity to renew economic imbalances and to promote the exercise of the rights of persons It is precisely the existence of the geographical condition the insularity which constitutes its specialty which is reflected in the sectors of the economy in the way we do business in the cost of transport and at a time when digital innovation is applied everywhere to new technologies for a strong propensity to change it is not easy believe me for us This is why it is urgent to intervene and this law will be an excellent tool an excellent measure that will necessarily have to be filled with content The State will then have to be the bearer of this project The Sardinian citizens have understood that a new scenario will open for the islands that has involved in addition to institutional representatives municipalities universities trade unions and professional associations schools migrant circles and that provides for equal opportunities especially in the world of work where they will compete on equal terms of departure It is a battle in synergy with Sicily the concept is a conscious insularity where the protection of the landscape civic uses language and culture can have an adequate recognition I would like to point out that from this important initiative born about five years ago with a strong proposal and decided through the collection of 200,000 signatures the promotion of a referendum the committee led by the late Mr Frongia the scientific committee led by Professor Mongiu the establishment of a special regional committee chaired by Mr Michele Costa and the continuation of the parliamentary process of the constitutional bill have included numerous legislative initiatives by the Regional Council and the Sardinian parliamentarians of all political groups which have decisively strengthened the need to fill the gap due to the serious natural disadvantage with a compactness that is rarely found As a parliamentary representative I cannot tolerate a productive island having to leave with a huge deficit like it has today There is the energy problem primarily due to the lack of methane and the transport of energy at very high costs which also applies to waste and its management At a time like this when the expensive bills bring Italy to its knees and not only families and businesses are affected the high energy also affects the local authorities with the risk of cuts for services Let us imagine the consequences for those who are disadvantaged In the island territories we have no possibility to bridge the territorial discontinuity with infrastructural interventions We need immaterial interventions that take their nature into account The State aid scheme is often ineffective and is not able to support companies Targeted legal arrangements and specific European regulations are needed to steer future policy towards the transport and long term energy sector For these reasons the recognition of the principle of insularity in the Constitution has gathered the consent of all civil society and not only It represents a transversal political and social battle It combines all Sardinian political groups cultural associations businesses the world of volunteering culture and sport Therefore on behalf of my Group I am so proud to vote in favour",#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,18.834116,-4.553656,28,"lunesu l sp psd az mr president today house going

#IannoneAntonio,IANNONE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister the measure before us today is the result of a work of unification of several legislative proposals the Brothers of Italy Group had also presented one to the House and the Senate with the aim of reorganizing the system of higher technical education and training also in the light of the objectives of the PNRR which has allocated a considerable amount to this system Higher technical institutes have existed for more than ten years represent training and high technological specialisation are closely integrated with the economic and productive world and have been born to enhance both human capital and the production system of the territories to compensate for the lack of specialised technicians in certain sectors Unfortunately in Italy however this system of higher technical education and training has remained largely unknown as its potential to become a tool to deal more easily with entry into the world of work If we analyse European data it is easy to grasp the delays of our tertiary training system and the lack of attraction towards it considering that only 0.01 of young people between 18 and 25 choose the higher technical institutes for continuing training Often this is little known by students families and teachers in charge of guidance All this is paradoxical in the light of the fact that in Italy youth unemployment is high and this type of direction is to be considered a real fundamental resource It is an important opportunity in order to interact the school community with the business system as it can provide through well calibrated paths an experiential didactic center on direct action and experimentation of the tasks and roles functional to those of the working reality both in terms of knowledge skills and strategies This is in order to address future challenges in a globalised and constantly changing world Moreover according to the latest data 80 of the graduates who chose this path found employment and 90 of them found employment in an area consistent with their own curriculum Therefore the role played by the information and guidance of young people and the communication to families about the nature and potential of this training channel which should not be considered a second choice compared to university is fundamental Another dysfunction that this system has shown is linked to the vision that these institutions must adapt to already defined professional profiles On the other hand there is no idea that they can create new roles new trades and new high quality professions thanks to the extension of further guidelines taking into account the specificity and vocations of our territories In this direction aimed at the expansion of the addresses and the enhancement of Made in Italy the proposal of the Fratelli d'Italia Group went to include itineraries in the ITS also referring to the high artistic craftsmanship which represents a peculiarity of our nation We are pleased with the work done in the Commission and I would of course like to thank President Nencini who is also rapporteur for the measure my colleagues and officials who have demonstrated many times the ability to work in a practical way and on the basis of the measures We have fired many bills in the Commission united by this spirit and we believe that even on this important option which is being put in place there can be a finalization of the large resource that is being destined In fact we are well aware that Italy has an identity heritage in its ability to propose quality of which there is hunger in the world and that it must find an instrument capable of not losing this identity and the possibilities of realization of many young people They must know that there is a real possibility of realization in these areas too and not only in that of intellectual performance I conclude by announcing the positive vote of the Brothers of Italy Group and pointing out that our efforts as always have been to improve the text Our patriotic and never preliminary opposition has always been marked by the proposal and we have fought so that this instrument can have an adherence to the vocations of the territory and the institutions of the same also with reference to the Regions noting also the failure which for the past undoubtedly there has been of a vocational training too often designed for the trainers and not for the formants Minister we hope that this instrument will be a real possibility and in this spirit we shall be voting in favour of the

#IannoneAntonio,IANNONE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government I will not dwell on the cultural and evocative power of our cinema this has already been done very well by my previous colleagues to whom I join Today however even with this debate here in the Chamber and in the discussion with the Government we have the opportunity to give a concrete witness to the attention that must be paid to the production of this cultural enterprise which is also a moral work The cinemas as indicated by the National Association of Cinema Exhibitors ANEC have been experiencing a situation of extreme difficulty since February 23 2020 when the entertainment sector was undermined with initial losses of more than 75 80 percent At European level receipts as can be easily seen have fallen by around 61 in Italy compared with 50 in Germany 38 in France 36 in Spain and 19 in the United Kingdom The motion presented by the Fratelli d'Italia Group n. 496 is the response of the patriotic opposition to the crisis of cinemas that arose from the comparison with all categories of the audiovisual sector We need to help cinemas in practice and allow cinemas to win back spectators we support a sector of our cultural industry In our motion we had indicated within a hundred and five days the window of exploitation of films both national and international We must say that thanks to the intercourse with the Government in particular with the Undersecretary Borgonzoni we are satisfied with the wording that is proposed which speaks and I also say this in detail of what President Nencini said of at least ninety days For us it is an important moment for the transposition of a wait In the same way we believe it is important that the Government has expressed a favourable opinion on another set of points summarized in the commitments of our motion and that they can certainly represent the polar star for the regulatory activity that must be put in place if we want to intervene concretely in support of this world I should like to mention many of the commitments that we consider to be fundamental on which we have been given a favourable opinion but unfortunately the limited time limits do not allow us to enter specifically and so I preferred to deal with the nodal aspect of the windows In any case Brothers of Italy will vote in favour of the motion that he presented and all the others because the moment of fall and meeting that there was certainly represents an important starting point for protecting this world,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,20.097506,-7.5261583,28,iannone fdi mr president ladies gentlemen representatives government dwell cultural evocative power cinema already done well previous colleagues join today however even debate chamber discussion government opportunity give concrete witness attention must paid production cultural enterprise also moral work cinemas indicated national association cinema exhibitors anec experiencing situation extreme difficulty since february 23 2020 entertainment sector undermined initial losses 75 80 percent european level receipts easily seen fallen around 61 italy compared 50 germany 38 france 36 spain 19 united kingdom motion presented fratelli d'italia group n. 496 response patriotic opposition crisis cinemas arose comparison categories audiovisual sector need help cinemas practice allow cinemas win back spectators support sector cultural industry motion indicated within hundred five days window exploitation films national international must say thanks intercourse government particular undersecretary borgonzoni satisfied wording proposed speaks also say detail president nencini said least ninety days us important moment transposition wait way believe important government expressed favourable opinion another set points summarized commitments motion certainly represent polar star regulatory activity must put place want intervene concretely support world like mention many commitments consider fundamental given favourable opinion unfortunately limited time limits allow us enter specifically preferred deal nodal aspect windows case brothers italy vote favour motion presented others moment fall meeting certainly represents important starting point protecting world
#SaponaraMaria,Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government when it comes to crisis and therefore the protection of cinemas we in the Lega Group believe that it is essential to analyse the phenomenon in its entirety and not just to fossilise ourselves on the need to help the operators of the sector which is certainly important and necessary but which must be included in a broader context We have therefore decided to concentrate mainly on three points which I would like to explain to this House If on the one hand we have the film and audiovisual production sector that despite the pandemic crisis and also thanks to the response of the State is experiencing a moment of particular growth on the other hand we have the cinemas and therefore the cinema distribution that live a situation of objective difficulties in which the performances of 2019 still appear far away unlike what happens instead in other countries This is also borne out by the fact that if 180 production companies applied for tax credits in 2019 493 were produced in 2021 Different things happen on the opposite front that of film distribution In fact if we compare the data of the first quarter of 2022 to those of 2019 we have negative values equal to at least 62.2 percent values that do not match absolutely those of the other countries which record data certainly less than us 34.2 percent for Germany 39.3 percent for Great Britain and 26.4 percent for Spain Even with regard to the collections we see a big difference Referring to the first four months of 2022 we note that Italy has decreased by less 7 percent while different things happen also in this case in the other countries of Europe such as France Great Britain Germany expose +47 +75 +20 and +45 percent It is therefore clear that there is a need for objective aid to film distribution operators but we must not stop here In fact the second point I would like to discuss with my colleagues in this House is the social and inclusive value of cinemas As has been said by the President of the Republic cinemas require attention and cannot be neglected precisely because of the social role they play both in large cities and in small centres as they are centres of aggregation In our country the crisis in cinemas is certainly higher than in other countries I would add that since childhood going to the cinema has always been a moment of great sociality not only for what happened before i.e. phone calls to get along but also for what could possibly happen after i.e. chats pizza and more In this sense cinemas are certainly an instrument of great sociality In short cinemas are a valuable cultural and social garrison in many territories and precisely for this reason we must do everything to preserve them and support them with effective tools that can encourage new ways of involving and encouraging viewers to go to the cinema adapted to the context and to the new habits of viewing cinematographic works Finally and this is the last point that I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate we must consider the system of windows that is the time between the first release of a film in a cinema and

Germany have a similar system to ours which provides windows only for national state funded films while for the UK there are no windows The data as it turns out are basically similar whether there is legislation on windows or there is n't To sum up and I should like to conclude Mr President in order to raise cinemas from the crisis it is important to consider mainly the factors I have just listed firstly by giving objective support to the sector by increasing substantially the resources for this purpose and in particular by strengthening aid for small and medium sized enterprises But surely we must also review the social role of cinemas it is necessary to encourage new strategies and methods of positioning cinemas on the market in terms of socio-cultural offer We must consider not only those who run the cinemas but also the viewers With regard to this Mr President I would like to point out that an investigation is being carried out by the Department of Culture precisely to see what are the new habits of viewers In short the windows should also be removable for both foreign and Italian films with the obligation of ninety days and no more as we are asked by the managers of the

#SaponaraMaria,SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to thank Minister Franceschini for the commitment he is making on this day in support of the cinemas and above all because he recognizes their social value because as such they must be absolutely supported in all their aspects I also thank you for the synthesis that has been found among the various motions presented by the various parliamentary groups especially on the point concerning windows which I think are an instrument as are the contributions and economic support given to cinema operators but which are not the only thing we have to look at Just because of the social value I was talking about earlier the cinemas as some previous colleagues have said must above all be rethought We need to rethink the culture of cinema we need to rethink how to use these rooms which must not only be simple containers where people the viewers go to see a film but something more precisely because of the changed habits and modes which however are different from the past Precisely for this reason precisely because we have to put new ideas in place to rethink the rooms bring back the spectators and make them live as an experience I would like to remember an experience that has been made I take this opportunity to thank the Undersecretary Lucia Borgonzoni who helped us find a synthesis for the motions This is an idea that was put on the field in 2019 by our undersecretary Lucia Borgonzoni Moviement from 1 May to 29 August 2019 made 140 million euros cash in the cinemas of our country This is to say that with new ideas proper promotion and collaboration between the entire film system and the institutions important results can be achieved So let 's think about the cinemas and put new ideas in the field precisely to restore dignity to a place that must be of sociality first of all but that must still represent a flagship for our culture and for the film production that our country has and has always had over time,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,19.888277,-7.0795975,28,saponara l sp psd az mr president would like thank minister franceschini commitment making day support cinemas recognizes social value must absolutely supported aspects also thank synthesis found among various motions presented various parliamentary groups especially point concerning windows think instrument contributions economic support given cinema operators thing look social value talking earlier cinemas previous colleagues said must rethought need rethink culture cinema need rethink use rooms must simple containers people viewers go see film something precisely changed habits modes however different past precisely reason precisely put new ideas place rethink rooms bring back spectators make live experience would like remember experience made take opportunity thank undersecretary lucia borgonzoni helped us find synthesis motions idea put field 2019 undersecretary lucia borgonzoni moviement 1 may 29 august 2019 made 140 million euros cash cinemas country say new ideas proper promotion collaboration entire film system institutions important results achieved let 's think cinemas put new ideas field precisely restore dignity place must sociality first must still represent flagship culture film production country always time
#BriziarelliLuca,"Mr President I would like to make three fundamental points among the many results that we have brought home together The first I thank my colleague Marti who is here next to me because we have brought him home together is the extension until 30 September of the outdoor spaces for bars restaurants and public establishments which will be able to take advantage of the summer season of course after payment but they will be jobs they will have entered for the companies I think it is a way to support a production system towards restarting We were asked from all over Italy especially from the tourist resorts and art cities Another important result that looks to the future is that it will finally allow the Italian airfields there are more than 600 to create fuel distributors this can on the one hand reduce the impact of the costs of the fuel on the other allow to have greater safety but above all to develop a sector that abroad especially in Germany and Spain produces important repercussions on the territory The third result that I would like to stress out of respect I say that it has been signed by colleagues from all the parliamentary groups by majority and opposition with strong support also from the Government concerns the national system of environmental protection It was born in 2017 it is not the sum of individual bodies and regional environmental agencies but it is something more a network system Well there were two basic twists the first of which was on staff When people went to block public employment and recruitment of course we were not there it was done in a linear way and the municipalities know something about it Well the assumption of ARPAs has been blocked Now they can assume 25 more and go to fill up with fundamental figures such as engineers and specialized technicians what is needed to protect the environment safety health and to complete the PNRR given all the competences we have given to the ARPA doing so in a concrete way because to defend the environment it is not enough to insert it Constitution I would like a minute more time to highlight something that is not right despite the fact that the entire Parliament and the entire Government were in favour for a surreal interpretation of the State Accounting I ask the Presidency to listen carefully Under Law No. 68 of 2015 environmental crimes have been introduced in defense of all Well an important task has been given to ARPAs who have completed it there are many sanctions imposed despite the shortage of staff The ARPA imposed fines and collected them we speak of 3,177,000 euros in 2017 5,402,000 euros in 2018 4,489,000 euros in 2019 3,772,000 euros in 2020 2021 is missing but we speak in all of almost 20 million euros but they cannot spend because it says that the ARPA does the fines and collects them but it does n't say that the ARPA can spend There are therefore EUR 20 million that we could devote to environmental protection just as ASL collects safety fines on workers from those who do not respect safety and can spend them on the basis of Legislative Decree No. 758 of 1994 the same cannot be done by ARPAs There is still money and it is someone 's responsibility if we cannot spend money on health and environmental protection so let us also solve the issue of this second part of the amendment signed by everyone and which the State Accounting Office did not want us to approve on a purely interpretative issue",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,26.38971,-10.799191,28,"mr president

#LaPietraPatrizioGiacomo,"THE PIETRA FdI Mr President members of the Government fellow senators we are at the third reading of this measure of popular initiative which leads us to the amendment of Article 119 of the Constitution including a very important concept the right of all citizens living on the islands to have the same possibilities and conditions of life as citizens living on the Continent I can only basically reiterate what we said at the first reading in this House in November 2021 This is an important act which recognizes to these citizens the difficulty of living in these territories albeit beautiful I therefore think that the measure under discussion can in fact establish the equal rights they must have such as education health and above all the right to carry out their work and life as other citizens We know that there are still strong elements of substantial discrimination against the communities of the islands but we must also stress that there are different conditions within these island communities I am referring to those who live in the major islands such as Sicily and Sardinia compared to the citizens who live in the smaller islands We know what are the most frequently proposed problems which I think are well known to all transport water supply health care education housing conditions and waste disposal hydrogeological disruption and even population desertification just to mention the most striking If therefore this process of desertification of our islands is to be stopped I am referring in particular to the smaller ones but nevertheless there are difficulties especially for young people even for the larger islands we must implement direct concrete measures In this respect I wonder for example what happened to the framework law on islands which was adopted in the Commission and which I still do not think has been implemented in practice Therefore the amendment to Article 119 of the Constitution certainly goes in this direction but we must be effective in drawing up administrative acts that help all citizens living in these islands and therefore prepare concrete actions to relaunch the economy This ladies and gentlemen must not be considered a privilege for these citizens but the only remedy to compensate for the difficulties of those living in the islands where production costs are much higher than in the rest of Europe because of the lack of infrastructure therefore within these territories an infrastructure design plan must also be implemented I would also like to reiterate one aspect that I mentioned earlier I believe that intellectual honesty must be shown that within the insularity there are differences between those who live on the two major islands I have heard my colleagues from Sardinia and Sicily talking with emphasis about this but we must also think about those who live in the smaller islands We are talking about about about 150,000 inhabitants scattered in about 40 islands because this is the geographical configuration of our nation From this point of view we must have further consideration because very often in the smaller islands there is also a lack of essential services schools hospitals first aid and drinking water networks I believe that also thanks to this measure perhaps there will be greater attention but it must be put into concrete actions with investments and resources that go in these directions Having said that Mr President I am voting in favour of the Group of Brothers of Italy",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#BergesioGiorgioMaria,Mr President the issue we are dealing with today is of considerable economic importance but above all on the repercussions it can have on the entire Italian country system We know that hundreds of Italian companies have survived the pandemic despite the huge declines in turnover today they risk to end up on their knees permanently because of the consequences of the war in Ukraine One in three statistical data and prospects for hand if it is not supported and helped in the various sectors risks closing The Government has already put in place concrete measures to support businesses workers and families I am referring first of all to energy price control measures against expensive bills allocating more than France and more than Germany For the benefit of companies operating agricultural and fishing activities the important contribution of the tax credit for the purchase of fuels in the first quarter of 2022 has been recognised we want to extend it so that prices do not return to the reference average for 2021 We must take a further step forward however and we cannot stand by and watch We need concrete measures up to the level with an extra budget deviation We need to review the National Recovery and Resilience Plan tear down all accounting records for five years and carry out important sectoral interventions starting precisely from agriculture the primary sector let 's never forget that if you lose agriculture lose food lose the future of our country We have a challenge ahead of us Through the maneuvers of public finance we have come to the challenge of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan which itself has a considerable investment programme both public and private In front of us however we have two orders of problems The first is linked to the implementation times of the interventions in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan which will be long Above all there is still no shadow of simplification We have bureaucratic regulations that engulf the speed of implementation of the Plan On the other hand there is the need as we have repeatedly said to re-determine the development objectives in the light of the increase in energy and raw materials costs which are unsustainable for the primary sector It has also been said by the rapporteurs that for the current year we have available a margin of 0.5 percentage points of Gross Domestic Product amounting to approximately € 9.5 billion which will be directed to actions to contain the price of fuels and the cost of energy to cover the increase in the prices of public works to increase the funds for credit guarantees and more generally to alleviate the economic impact of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine According to a study by Intesa Sanpaolo the war will on average cost 2000 euros more to the family and a total increase of expenditure of 188 billion euros for the purchase of goods and services by Italian companies compared to the pre-conflict period We know very well what the tax burden in our country is we are close to almost 50 With regard to the agricultural sector in addition to the measures in favour of the whole energy and energy sector we also called for the support of research and together to strengthen the training system for young farmers in order to facilitate the introduction of new technologies and thus promote this process of ecological transition so important for our country We have also called for measures to be taken to cut back to calm down to contain prices and to provide for the necessary controls Here too checks are necessary The guarantee authorities must do their job both on fuels and on the entire energy phase of our country An important issue concerns the mutual fund relating to natural disasters and meteoclimatic disasters which is of vital importance to our country I would remind this House that many of our farmers have already been frozen at the beginning of the year and hailed on crops which were not insured because the insurance companies could not and wanted to ensure causes the risk Let us remember the approval also in the Commission of our requests to maintain protection including in favour of fragile workers and to extend them for as long as necessary We have expressed the need for some important measures for the primary sector We have entered the government above all in the spirit of not cutting taxes and we do not want this important element to be flooded with other choices These are choices that we do not share and therefore we will always work and monitor to ensure constant and concrete support for the productive sectors and families in order to try to hang up that recovery that seems lost to date,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#BagnaiAlberto,Mr President I take advantage of the general debate on this measure extending the state of emergency and we hope that we can assume that it is the last for both legal and epidemiological reasons to leave a few brief remarks in the minutes The pandemic comes to an end wherever in Europe the restrictive measures taken or not taken are abandoned The rapporteur herself pointed out that the decree law but I should say the decree- law since Decree Law No 229 of 2021 has merged as an amendment in No 221 in question has now surpassed the events Everywhere in Europe we conform to the wise words attributed to Keynes When the facts change I change my opinions What would you do These words however Keynes never said Samuelson said them but they have a sense of themselves Forgive me the emphasis on the paternity of the quotation which is not only an excess of erudite fetishism but it is also a way to enter into the heart of a theme that I feel I must and I know I can bring to your attention the worrying cultural regression which risks being one of the heaviest and most persistent legacy of this pandemic a regression that has taken the worrying forms of the compression of every free debate in this and in all other forums for the benefit of a totalizing and totalitarian appeal to the principle of authority to the ipse ixit When what is said becomes less important than those who say it it is easy for us to start on roads without exit especially considering that in the Middle Ages ipse was Aristotle and today it is the Scientific Technical Committee in which forgive me all those involved I cannot see a huge progress if I must evaluate the contribution of this organism in the light of the instruments that my scientific training offers me to judge colleagues of unfamiliar discipline the validity of the forecasts and the internal coherence of the affirmations The journalists had fun and I do n't want to bore you with the repertoire of pirouettes and false predictions that this body has provided us I 'm going back to my concern I am concerned about the analogy between the use a certain policy has made of science and what it has been doing with Europe since ancient times Europe first and science then have become the means by which a political class has shunned its responsibilities among other things making these means an always curiously asymmetrical use Science has been used to close but it recalcits to use it to open science has been used to impose obligations that have proved to be scientifically unfounded but still do not want to take note of it Unfortunately and I am also referring to Mr Cantù 's remarks the first result of the high alpha and omega of our debate also political this paradoxical faith in science because I believe in science is an oxymoron science should be doubt investigation was that many citizens have lost confidence in the science and institutions that have taken refuge in it in order to escape their responsibilities A similar asymmetry again in the context of the measure we are analysing applies to the so called Europe which it is worth remembering would be the European Union The Covid 19 pass was born with EU Regulation 2021/953 as a tool to facilitate freedom of movement and avoid hateful discrimination it is in that spirit that I personally voted in favour of this House on 16 June 2021 at the time it seemed necessary to promote the free movement of European citizens in order not to kill the tourist season The application that has been made however has gone in another direction and we must tell us the instrument has been used to limit the circulation of Italian citizens and has given rise to a series of hatefully discriminatory behaviours and continuous intolerable violations of privacy including criminalization of citizens who were simply exercising their own right Among other things this has caused considerable damage which has been mentioned in this general discussion to many economic activities My colleague Mr Antonio Rinaldi 's question about how the Commission intends to intervene to combat these discriminatory behaviours has remained unresolved The European regulations apply when they are used for example with the bail in to clear the savings of Italian citizens they are interpreted when they are used to defend their freedom This is a curious asymmetry We must re-appropriate because we are capable of doing so our ability to judge the measures from their results From this point of view I must say that it is very difficult even in an international comparative perspective to give a positive judgment of the green pass in the version we have experienced in Italy with its set of obligations on whose dubious constitutional legitimacy Professor Alessandro Mangia spreads authoritatively in one of his last speeches The amendments which the League has tabled here and which it will present on the occasion of the next many deadlines of similar decrees are designed to make this instrument less vexatory What the League has however authoritatively asked at the mouth of its leaders is that it be definitively abandoned with the end of the state of emergency because we are concerned that our life is entrusted to a digital pass in a country that has not yet posed the theme of transposing into the Constitution the protection of the digital identity of the person the subject of a bill deposited by Mr Morelli to the House A country in which even that minimum right is not protected which is the ability to make and receive electronic payments and does not avoid condemning to civil death those who for some reason see themselves rejecting the opening of an account from a banking institution as Senator Siri asks for a long time with a bill of pure common sense on which we still await the opinion of the Government In theory passwords are digital and inclusive but then in practice the entire digital infrastructure is used to exclude and that worries us We are concerned to entrust our existence or digital pass in a country where there are no strong legislative garrisons against the possibility of seeing our digital identity crippled or reset but also in a country whose computer infrastructures have proven to be very permeable Here in Lazio always to remain on the subject of health it was demonstrated last summer with collapse due to an attack of hackers the infrastructure of the regional health with all the problems that then have been achieved So although it certainly will not be the intention because the intentions will certainly be excellent but we are concerned about an instrument that could be in fact the Viatico or the assumption of a capitalism of Chinese control If we want to regain competitiveness towards this important and to some extent worrying competitor we must not pursue it on its own path that of the system of social credits but we must continue to affirm our path towards progress which is the protection always and in every place of freedom Freedom not repression has guaranteed Europe its excellence and has made possible the many scientific and technological revolutions that today provide us with unthinkable levels of well being even a century ago Let us continue on the path of freedom,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

demolished from an ideological point of view can continue to play its role from a social point of view It does n't work that way once the family is destroyed and demolished it is forever and you can't think that the birth rate is filled with other resources The birth rate is filled with the family and nothing different My thoughts today go to the 20 million Italian families to the 20 million dads and moms who woke up this morning accompanied their children to school went to work prepared breakfast for them lunch for when they return I think about the everyday life of this work that is very often left without resources help and support The first major drawback of this measure is that we have once again wanted to link the policies that are said to be familiar but in reality they are social to the question of the ISEE we cannot link family policies to the ISEE because this is a tool for measuring wealth and it is fine if we want to use it for policies to fight poverty so that families people who must be helped out of poverty have a reliable measurer But at a time when we want to make family policies we have to get out of this kind of ISEE loop because the ISEE is not primarily made for family policies Excuse me we give indiscriminately the bonus facades we have the money for the bonus earthquake as is right that it is without considering the ISEE and in the face of an emergency such as that of the birthday we link the policies of support for birth to the ISEE You know this is crazy We have the money to give the bonus facades to all Italians and instead we limit the policies of support to the birth with the tool of the ISEE This is in itself the first of the great problems The second of the great problems is that the ISEE moreover is an unfair instrument that misjudges wealth It is an instrument that for example measures gross wealth But how do you calculate the ISEE on the basis of gross income So we force Italians who already pay taxes to pay them twice because they also find their wealth indicator based not on net income as it would be right but on gross income as it happens today Again we have repeatedly pointed out the need to remove the family home from the basket of the ISEE because it does not produce any income for the family that lives in it The family home is the minimum union that we have to recognize to the family in order to be able to raise their children in order to do what the Constitution requires to do Let us not forget that maintaining educating and educating children is not a habit that Italian families have but it is a duty that the Constitution imposes on them We cannot therefore tax that part of the income that families use for their constitutionally established duty precisely which is to maintain educate and educate the offspring Minister we must make a decisive change of pace We have to decide whether we really want to invest in this country and the family or whether we want to keep telling each other about it We can tell it for the next centuries but the result unfortunately Istat tells us will invariably be the same and that is a painful demographic decline of our country that from the present about 60 million inhabitants will soon reach 30 35 million inhabitants without considering the effects of denatality on the social balance Currently the generation that is holding the weight of the elderly and people who are no longer self sufficient because of the age is still a large slice because they are the so called baby boomers born between the fifties and sixties But when baby boomers retire underneath there will be no one paying those pensions instead of a demographic pyramid we will have a demographic fungus in which the part of the active population will be so small that it will no longer be able to bear the burden This is not about making ideological policies but simply about having common sense about investing in the future of our country about the most important good that we have that is our families Families Minister are mother and father with children it is not difficult It 's been like this forever since there 's the world Let us forget the ideologies and invest in the true primary good of our country the natural family the one that our Constitution contemplates At this point I would like to thank Mr Bonetti for listening to Parliament and all the political forces who unanimously called for the opening of a table for the reform of the ISEE It is certainly a very important step and I am very pleased with that because it is a result of all the political forces in Parliament But we must go beyond the reform of the ISEE we must have the courage to say that the ISEE cannot be applied to family policies We must have the courage to say that in addition to parental leave in addition to kindergartens they are for goodness sake a commendable policy contained in this provision we must finally arrive at a family friendly tax Let 's call it flat tax let 's call it family factor let 's call it whatever you want the concept is very simple everything the family earns and spends to raise children cannot be taxed cannot be touched by tax It 's very simple Minister This is what we have to get to the rest for goodness sake are interesting ideas they are proposals animated by the best interest but they will not solve the problem All this to say that this is a measure on which we will certainly as will be said later in the debate and in the explanation of vote will not fail to support us However we ask you for courageous policies and a courageous change of pace We can no longer hear ourselves say in this Parliament that there is no money If there 's no money for our kids then there 's no money for anything else You tell me what it 's like to build motorways what 's the point of building railways what 's the point of investing in who knows what infrastructure if those infrastructures are n't used by anyone why are n't our children using them anymore Might as well reverse the trend We might as well finally have the courage to say that today who brings a child into the world is a hero and the State must put itself at the

#PirovanoDaisy,Mr Minister I am pleased with your words but of course I will be able to say that I am satisfied when I see the facts that there will be a radical change in the management of migration If it is true that there is the big problem of redistribution we know that we we have to think about our country everyone will think about his can act really doing what he just said about limited numbers because the greater the mass arrivals the more difficult it will be to manage integration I also say this as mayor of a small municipality where immigrants are not considered foreigners but have a name a surname a face but we cannot continue to leave all the weight of integration on schools especially at this time when young people already have so many problems due to the pandemic the DAD and what follows One cannot leave all the weight of integration on municipalities or volunteering When they arrive on our territory immigrants need not only to receive a bed and something to eat but when they make their citizenship journey to feel truly Italian citizens I confer citizenships but I know perfectly well that there are enormous problems of cultural clashes and if at home the first generation family that has not had an integration gives teachings not in line with our values obviously the boy will never understand what the right line to follow at school one thing is taught at home they teach him maybe another not all because there are also integrated families So you have to act quickly because these episodes are the tip of an iceberg Even in our small centers we notice disturbing phenomena that make us understand that these people do not feel at home and the only way to respect the rules is to feel at home and love the country in which we are located We must therefore help those who arrive in our country to integrate even by limiting arrivals,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,24.76371,-1.2284571,28,mr minister pleased words course able say satisfied see facts radical change management migration true big problem redistribution know think country everyone think act really said limited numbers greater mass arrivals difficult manage integration also say mayor small municipality immigrants considered foreigners name surname face cannot continue leave weight integration schools especially time young people already many problems due pandemic dad follows one cannot leave weight integration municipalities volunteering arrive territory immigrants need receive bed something eat make citizenship journey feel truly italian citizens confer citizenships know perfectly well enormous problems cultural clashes home first generation family integration gives teachings line values obviously boy never understand right line follow school one thing taught home teach maybe another also integrated families act quickly episodes tip iceberg even small centers notice disturbing phenomena make us understand people feel home way respect rules feel home love country located must therefore help arrive country integrate even limiting arrivals
#NastriGaetano,Mr President the measure before us should have been a genuine strategy for the economy of our nation especially to protect two people businesses and citizens This decree law should have looked yes to our generation but above all to the future ones which will find in their hands instead a bad legacy left by this Government You are very unbelievable and the demonstration lies above all in the issues you are dealing with which in your opinion are the priorities We are talking about the mandatory POS with penalties for those who do not adapt the lottery of receipts the obligation of electronic invoicing for those who even fall under the flat rate scheme Instead of working to solve the problems of citizens and businesses the last Council of Ministers decides well to postpone to a date which we do not know therefore not well defined the energy interventions Well I think you can't do worse than that Italian companies as we all know Brothers of Italy does not say are in great trouble 30 percent have reduced their production and within very few according to all the associations of category the damage will be incalculable Apart from all the measures you are taking even in a very forced way from our point of view practicality and a strategy continue to be lacking and we will never stop saying so In the measure that we are about to vote on the worst thing is that nothing is simplified the serious obstacle to innovation and also to investment continues which we should somehow attract Today that is those who come to invest in Italy find a mountain to climb and this acts as a disincentive Of course we of Brothers of Italy are not and will never be for a consumption of wild soil but we cannot remain hostage We must say that there has been great scientific progress in recent years including with regard to innovative materials and this could enable us to govern the process of energy transition in our territories and also in our cities We know perfectly well that there is no zero impact What is lacking in this measure is clear namely a reference to fuels which nowadays certainly represent one of the highest costs that both companies and citizens have to face So this is certainly a problem and the government has done little or even nothing to date Let us not forget that inflation rose to 6.7 percent in March The transport sector which is certainly a very important sector with regard to our country especially the rubber sector plays a primary role and is also a key sector with regard to the employment front so the objective would be to immediately reduce the excise duty of 40 as we have repeatedly proposed in all the various Commissions We must also intervene on VAT and not create disparities as many industry associations denounce An entire chain risks being brought to its knees because of this Government which has created a real competition between fuels It is clear that this situation has become unsustainable both for operators in the sector and especially for users The process of ecological transition of which so much is spoken and as I prefer to define it of ecological conversion because in fact they are all conversions is irreversible and crucial and must lead Italy towards the definitive abandonment of fossil sources and adopt more sustainable energy sources as I said before Mr President we know perfectly well that nothing has a zero impact but we must also get used to the idea that we can no longer procrastinate and that we also need sensible and courageous choices In this measure as I said before I see no simplification at all Unfortunately this decree law creates additional bureaucracy and above all confusion That same bureaucracy perhaps represents the worst limit for achieving the decarbonisation objectives so much desired These limits of course will never allow us continuing with this step to achieve what our country needs namely energy independence The real nightmare especially in recent years is the construction of RES plants renewable energy sources but the lack of streamlined procedures discourages investments in our country Let 's not forget that Germany has started running also launching an important plan to install 20 gigawatts per year for the next three years which will accelerate to increase to 40 gigawatts until 2035 Same thing France is doing What about Italy Nothing and this is definitely your demerit The aim is to avoid losing the great opportunities that are provided to us as we have always said in this House by the PNRR We must remind all of us that it will be our children and also grandchildren who will repay the debt Therefore it should also be implemented in a strategic way What is lacking today is not only strategy but also foresight You have not approved any solution regarding the promotion of self production and self consumption of energy for households and businesses The energy efficiency of buildings must be encouraged Let us not forget that a large part of the public administration offices is old and obsolete And I want to denounce in this House also the waste of heating in public facilities of which no one is talking and which represent a real slap to all those families that today are struggling to reach the end of the month and who do not know how to pay energy bills No mention of the Made in Italy and the incentives to re-launch the national production of the sector and also of the induced We have completely forgotten the territories that have been affected by the earthquake More could and had to be done for the implementation of centralized systems for production and distribution in the community The laws should include some measures but they have not done so for a long time and this is certainly a big problem When the left was a social left he said that there was an obvious problem of development model He does n't say anything anymore The need to supply gas especially during this period certainly exists but we cannot and must not make the same mistake that we have made with Russia and that Brothers of Italy has always remarked Self sufficiency is certainly important to us and it is clear that going to Qatar today rather than to Algeria serves Self sufficiency however involves a serious battle and nothing is said about this in the provision before our examination This decree law does not even mention the energy transition plan In conclusion Mr President we are also genuinely concerned about the superficiality with which such a sensitive matter is being dealt with This is a situation as I said before which is certainly unsustainable and cannot and must not be put on the subject of Italian energy shortages on individual citizens and on individual families because this would bring our businesses to their knees The Italians look at you they hear you Definitely without strategy this country will have nothing This is an empty decree- law which as I said before lacks strategy and foresight But the Italians are there they hear you and they will surely take them into account,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,23.953608,-10.199034,28,mr president measure us

#NastriGaetano,Minister with this question the Brothers of Italy Group once again asks for clarity on the strategic vision of the Government if it exists with regard to the issue of energy It is clear to everyone that the Ukrainian Russian conflict and Europe 's strong dependence on Russian gas have imposed on the Presidents of the European Union a change of strategy on energy policy also in order to reduce dependence on Russia All this is made even more evident by the enormous increase in energy costs in Italy with serious social and employment repercussions both for families and for businesses The Government has launched a dialogue with several foreign states in order to conclude new agreements aimed at increasing the supply of gas from relatively safer countries also because it is news today there has been a 40 reduction in supply However the Italian Government does not seem to want to continue along the path of national energy independence According to recent data the need for natural gas in Italy is about 70 billion cubic meters and of these only 4.5 less than 6 is extracted in Italy that as we all know is also rich in methane deposits but are unused precisely because of limits and prohibitions deriving from the moratorium of the blockade to drilling and extractions and also as regards bureaucracy The recognition of natural gas as an energy source towards the ecological transition would certainly be a historic opportunity for our national deposits Yet just a few days ago Minister MEPs of the 5 Star Movement and the Democratic Party opposed the Commission 's proposal to include gas in the taxonomic list of renewable energy sources For this reason we are asking you Minister at the same time what your opinion is supported in European terms by Members representing certain parties of your majority on this subject and especially if the Government intends to increase national gas production by renewing authorisations,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,27.255323,-9.61832,28,minister question brothers italy group asks clarity strategic vision government exists regard issue energy clear everyone ukrainian russian conflict europe 's strong dependence russian gas imposed presidents european union change strategy energy policy also order reduce dependence russia made even evident enormous increase energy costs italy serious social employment repercussions families businesses government launched dialogue several foreign states order conclude new agreements aimed increasing supply gas relatively safer countries also news today 40 reduction supply however italian government seem want continue along path national energy independence according recent data need natural gas italy 70 billion cubic meters 4.5 less 6 extracted italy know also rich methane deposits unused precisely limits prohibitions deriving moratorium blockade drilling extractions also regards bureaucracy recognition natural gas energy source towards ecological transition would certainly historic opportunity national deposits yet days ago minister meps 5 star movement democratic party opposed commission 's proposal include gas taxonomic list renewable energy sources reason asking minister time opinion supported european terms members representing certain parties majority subject especially government intends increase national gas production renewing authorisations
#NastriGaetano,Minister in the light of your answers we continue to be perplexed because promises are not enough we have been waiting for you for too many months now but real and concrete legislative measures are needed to remove the ideological stop to the extractions We know that Italy is heavily dependent on the import of gas as you said before but thanks to its resources dependence could be reduced You see Minister families and businesses are paying a very high price so that many companies risk closure and failure thus creating further unemployment Instead we must note that this Government moves in perfect continuity I would say also in perfect harmony with the precedents because it is clearly slave to an ideological drift as we saw in the vote a few days ago even if you did not want to say something more it was obvious because the PD and the Movimento 5 Stars voted against This is definitely not good You have also claimed the name of the Government of the Best but day after day we realize that instead you are the Government of the Bestists Therefore it must be removed Minister the illogical stop to the new extractions that lead precisely to the upper Adriatic And then you did not say anything Minister about an absurd situation that of Croatia which takes advantage of our immobility and manages to do everything We are not satisfied with your answer because Minister the difference between us and the rest of the world is in our opinion the priority given to defending the interests of Italians So we will continue this battle because if the answers are given in this way we will clearly never be satisfied,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,23.315994,-9.3559265,28,minister light answers continue perplexed promises enough waiting many months real concrete legislative measures needed remove ideological stop extractions know italy heavily dependent import gas said thanks resources dependence could reduced see minister families businesses paying high price many companies risk closure failure thus creating unemployment instead must note government moves perfect continuity would say also perfect harmony precedents clearly slave ideological drift saw vote days ago even want say something obvious pd movimento 5 stars voted definitely good also claimed name government best day day realize instead government bestists therefore must removed minister illogical stop new extractions lead precisely upper adriatic say anything minister absurd situation croatia takes advantage immobility manages everything satisfied answer minister difference us rest world opinion priority given defending interests italians continue battle answers given way clearly never satisfied
#PizzolNadia,"Madam President ladies and gentlemen Government this measure has the task of combating the obvious demographic crisis of Italians and tidying up the various rules to support parenthood In my opinion it is very important to find solutions to the problems faced by working women in reconciling the desire for motherhood with work and the need to secure certain income in order to guarantee the new life what it needs If they do not have economic security Italian couples suppress the desire for parenthood because they fear that they cannot manage it or that they cannot manage the child when they do not have the grandparents to whom they can entrust him if he gets sick Let 's think of a self employed woman forced to close the store for example Currently there are no kindergartens although they are provided for by the PNRR they are not enough now One of the problems lies also in the ISEE parameters adopted for the payment of the single cheque which penalise too much those who create income and contribute to Italian GDP I think for example that a monthly single allowance of EUR 50 is too small for dependent children at ISEE equal to or greater than EUR 40,000 In other European countries which have our own problem of birth they give about 200 a month regardless of income This seems to me to be a fairer and more suitable measure for stimulating births It certainly does not encourage the sum of 50 euros per month three times lower than old family allowances given the high costs that couples would have to meet with a young child Far from speaking for those who are deprived of income or have insufficient income to be able to afford a substantial number of children as unfortunately happens in the many families of immigrants present in Italy and constantly arriving At a time like this when our pensioners do not know how to pay the bills and they also give up the indispensable such as non-refundable medicines or heating it seems to me too much to give measures to welfare everyone indistinguishably also because for each child you grant a cheque of at least 175 euros for the lower bands Plato in the fourth century before Christ admonished the Athenians by telling them that when a citizen accepts that whoever happens to them in the house can acquire the same rights as those who built it and were born there when the leaders tolerate all this in order to gain vows and consents in the name of freedom that devours and corrupts every rule so democracy dies for abuse of itself and before blood dies in ridicule It seems to me that in Italy there is now this way of acting It is right to be unselfish but without exaggerating I think that the universal single cheque as we have come to determine is too costly a measure to put on the shoulders of our future generations In fact at this rate forced to support the children of all I doubt there could be future generations able to pay the public debt I think that the Italian parliamentarians must first solve the problems of their fellow citizens because there will be no future generations if we condemn that of now to keep the children of all If at a time of generosity we have given too much now I think it is time to take a step back without prejudice to the aid to all the mothers and children who come from Ukraine In addition to removing the ISEE I believe that the dependent child allowance should be linked to all workers regardless of whether they are in compliance with the payment of contributions as it was before the single allowance We are the only country that has these rich measures of indiscriminate welfare and the one with the largest public debt In other European countries subsidies are given to non-EU foreigners only if they are political refugees or have obtained international protection Since reading some articles of the draft delegation I have had the feeling that I am faced with too ambitious and costly projects Where are the resources to do all these beautiful things while we are so insensitive to the many fellow citizens who do not know how to get to the end of the month I think it 's essential to be on the

#PizzolNadia,Madam President fellow Senators Government following a bill of popular initiative today we amend Article 119 of the Constitution adding a paragraph by which the Italian Republic recognises the peculiarity of the islands and promotes the measures necessary to remove the disadvantages resulting from insularity This is not a constitutional reform of a merely compensation nature In fact it will allow to look at the large and small islands as a heritage to be valued not only from the tourist point of view but also in its cultural linguistic and biodiversity peculiarities therefore in everything that constitutes an element of richness and diversity of our country The integration of this constitutional principle and the subsequent legislative instruments will allow us to have the means to bridge the gap or at least part of it that separates things and people of the major and minor islands of our country from the rest of the Italian citizens We think of Sicily and Sardinia and of the serious difficulties of connections with the mainland with increased costs of the transport of people goods and services that guarantee the territorial continuity There are also problems in the water supply housing conditions and waste disposal not to mention the weight of health emergencies or fires where the speed of intervention determines its effectiveness Even Venice where I live with the many islands and islets addresses many of the problems mentioned There are indeed so many difficulties in the daily lives of the inhabitants such as to penalise them Last but not least there is the time factor which with transports expands considerably in the fulfillment of the normal daily chores that are done on land in half time There are often other types of discomfort in island territories such as higher rates of ageing of the resident population as fewer economic opportunities encourage young people to move to the mainland This results in reduced employment rates and lower labour force skills as well as unemployment and depopulation which are also stimulated by infrastructure shortages and high transport costs The Italian Republic is finally called to recognize

#MaffoniGianpietro,"MAFFONI FdI Mr President Minister Bonetti ladies and gentlemen I am speaking here today first of all with some data on which we should all bitterly reflect 1.3 children per woman is the average today in Italy with a first child who is on average at the age of thirty one The demographic dynamic of 2021 continues to be negative and the natural balance of the population is always strongly negative as of December 31 2021 I report some Istat data the population resident in Italy amounted to almost 59 million units 250,000 less than the same date of 2020 This is certainly due to the dramatic excess of mortality caused by the Covid to the strong contraction of migratory movements but even more to the decrease of births which coming below the threshold of 400,000 has recorded a new historical minimum by the unity of Italy The non-enviable record which does not reach 400,000 units and the high number of deaths more than 700,000 continue to aggravate a negative natural dynamic that characterizes our country for several years However and here we must focus ladies and gentlemen this is not a European and Western theme we cannot hide behind these figures behind the screen of modern society which focuses on economic growth at the expense of demographic and social growth Of course it is noted that for decades our modern society has been less focused on the needs of the family But some European data lead us to think that the demographic crisis in Italy is more serious than in other countries If in our borders we have said that a woman does not reach the average of 1.3 children in countries like Germany and France we approach the two units for each woman France in particular is characterised by fertility rates which have always been much higher than in the rest of the European Union In 2009 this index was equal to two children per woman and despite a decrease the average number of children per mother remains high Why is this happening Why is this figure recorded in France while in Italy we are witnessing a continuous contraction of births Where does this problem come from if not from the shy policies that have been adopted in recent years on such a sensitive subject I want to be clear from the outset Senator colleagues and fellow Senators in declaring that Brothers of Italy has always and unequivocally fought for everything that can be of support to the growth of the birth rate in this country Brothers of Italy was available and always will be to sit at tables that can help the family which as Pope John XXIII said is the first essential cell of human society We have been available and will always be in implementing policies that inspired by other nations are able to offer free educational services or to promote cooperation between the private and the public in implementing policies to support the growth of the birth We have always been in favour of implementing policies of leave for paternity and motherhood that are more significant than those that are now recognised both in terms of numbers and in terms of economics Our battle Minister Bonetti is to offer unique checks for dependent children to all and not just to some From our point of view in fact the right to have a child must not see distinctions of social class or geographical areas However ladies and gentlemen despite the closeness to this issue and the sensitivity with which we want to address it we are obliged to announce our abstention on this measure This is a grievous abstention but not because we are opposed to some of the decisions taken by the draft law in question but because we believed and we still believe this that something more could be done and must be done Minister we were expecting more courage from you on this issue We expected more reliable times in which to study and build this measure we expected more resources and funds to counter a hemorrhage of births which in the future could have devastating consequences for our society and for our country The Brothers of Italy Group as already announced in the Chamber of Deputies has been voted against a series of changes that is right such as the promotion of part time as a choice for mothers There has been a vote against aid to enterprises for the recruitment of new mothers or young women or against the gratuitousness of childcare which we find essential for both the child and the family Minister we expected something more about the recalculation of the ISEE which is an essential instrument for the application of aid to young families We expected more courage on paternity leave or early retirement for working mothers with three children Finally we expected some intervention for international adoptions which are unfortunately today a road that can now be travelled by a few who want to assure small often unlucky a better future That is why Minister our vote today will be abstention We do not want to be complicit in any way in a measure that does not find the answers we were looking for just as we do not want to be complicit in a series of decisions that do not have the strength to implement the policies that our country needs today We certainly recognize Mr Bonetti especially you and many of your colleagues in the majority that we have tried to improve this measure We recognise with the usual intellectual honesty that distinguishes us that there have been some significant agendas in the Commission and we have been assured that we will re-evaluate the criteria for the ISEE parameters However Mr President in conclusion the Brothers of Italy Group on a sensitive issue such as this we had very different expectations We of the Brothers of Italy Group have always been at the side of the family and of all those who fight for it with strength and determination That is why Minister Bonetti I say to you and to all the Members of the Assembly that on this theme Brothers of Italy as well as it will not do discounts from the opposition desks will never escape from constructive tables where we can fight to carry out noble battles such as those aimed at the contrast of the birthday or at the side of the family The interest of the Italians and the Nation is for us primary and certainly will not be lacking today or in the future",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,23.13254,-2.5050504,28,"maffoni fdi mr president

#DoriaCarlo,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen today is a very important day because the measure concerning the inclusion of the principle of insularity in the Constitution is back in the Chamber and it is therefore the Sicilian and Sardinian Members who have always lived the insularity and also suffered If on the one hand the insularity and its remoteness from the continent as we use to say was in my opinion an opportunity for Sardinia to be a laboratory of genetics that selected genomes that gave our land the epithet of the centenarians recognized all over the world on the other hand today this condition of insularity is lived as a disadvantage and a ball at the foot of the economic development of Sardinian society It is also enough to read today 's newspapers which highlight the problem of maritime and air transport caused by the uncertainty of carriers engaged in a territorial continuity sui generis which has nothing to do with that of other European regions as well as the high price increases for both passengers and goods this is a decisive factor in limiting and preventing the long awaited growth There are clear responsibilities that must be sought in a stepmother attitude by the Italian State and the European institutions which continue to trample on the rights of a people as well as its special autonomy as a Region unlike many others even Italian Today does not want to be the moment of recriminations but the moment of awareness and the fight for the recognition of inalienable rights For completeness I mention only two still unresolved points that must represent our battle horses for the next political struggles and that will allow our islands to compete in equal arms with the other regions of Europe the inclusion of Sardinia and Sicily in the list of poor European regions and the recognition for Sardinia of the linguistic minority that is the Sardinian language spoken by more than one million Italians and with it of the parliamentary representation by default as happens for other realities such as the Val d'Aosta or the Trentino Alto Adige not succubi of the only barrier of 3 percent When the European Economic Community was set up in writing the Treaties those who preceded us thought well of protecting the regions which for geographical reasons of insularity could be disadvantaged compared to the continental ones and for which there were derogations both for State aid and for the rules of maritime and air transport allowing for a certain deregulation Too bad that while for many European countries we have been able to list the regions that we might call uncomfortable the Azores for Portugal Corsica and also the overseas territories for France the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands for Spain the Faroe Islands for Denmark Italy has not indicated any region Therefore we in Sardinia for example live that state of perennial disadvantage compared to our neighbour Corsica which translates into a less productive capacity and social well being and which pushes our fellow countrymen to seek it by emigrate The political rise of President Draghi has illuded us that his international prestige could be put at the service of our cause but perhaps representing with our 1,600,000 inhabitants the size of two large Roman districts we do not represent a sufficient critical mass and worthy of respect Today however it wants to be a good day to allow us to add a new piece to improve our Constitution and try to make it fairer and more supportive We are convinced that we will support this measure Thank you and Fortza

#FregolentSonia,"FREGOLENT L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government first of all we should also like to thank Senator Binetti and all the members of the Health Commission for the unitary agenda we are preparing to vote on The themes have been extensively illustrated in the various interventions that have followed and I would like to focus on paediatric tumors sharing a reflection that starts from the love of a parent for his child an unconditional love which cannot be explained but can only be lived You know him when you 're lucky enough to see that baby in your arms for the first time and stays forever That is why it is said that there is no more painful thing for a parent than to lose a child Here is the anomaly the increase of cancers in paediatric and adolescent age The Italian association registers tumors estimates that in the five years 2016 2020 in Italy 7,000 cancers have been diagnosed among children and 4,000 among adolescents between the fifteen and nineteen years in line with the previous five years When you meet one of those parents who have transformed such pain into the mission of a life to help other young lives the question that comes spontaneously is what are the priorities of this country How important is our daily running in the face of the suffering of certain people But most importantly are we doing everything we can on health and research issues We as a group believe not We are convinced that more and better could be done if we were all honest in recognising priorities and working with strict rules to marginalize inappropriateness because every mismanaged resource is a failure to respond to one of our fellow citizens Some of the things we ask for are so basic that it surprises us to have to repeat them In particular I am referring to the correct and uniform treatment of the paediatric oncology patient promoting at territorial level the multidisciplinary approach and teamwork with the presence of several specialists and with the aim of ensuring and improving the psychophysical well being of the patient and his family A survey conducted in Italy by the Soleterre ONLUS Foundation and the Trauma Research Unit of the Catholic University of Milan from November 2019 to September 2021 on adolescents between the ages of twelve and twenty three years at the pediatric oncoematology unit of the Policlinico San Matteo di Pavia showed clinically significant anxiety and depression How could it be otherwise It is already difficult when such oncologic diseases affect as adults let us imagine when one is in the prime of the years The psychological assistance of paediatric patients and their families in the medical oncology departments carried out by qualified graduates in psychology is crucial It is necessary and fundamental however that our country through the action of the Government undertakes to support scientific research The rare disease law is a first step but we need to do more for the development of new therapies allocate funds for innovative paediatric cancer drugs activate experimental treatment protocols and develop clinical trials through a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach In addition it is necessary to provide for the allocation of funds for the economic support of low income households taking into account the costs to be incurred in the case of admissions to care centres away from their residence This last aspect inevitably leads us to the issue of fairness in access to care no one should have a greater or lesser chance of curing himself on the basis of where he is born Parliament therefore has the task of identifying certain rules of accountability and proper use of resources to ensure that all regions offer efficient responses to their fellow citizens without lowering the bar of effectiveness of responses and claiming that the whole chain from the executive summit to the I shall conclude Mr President It must be demanded that the whole chain from the executive summit to the individual socio health worker OSS works in all regions towards a single objective that of guaranteeing the health of each of us For all these reasons I announce the vote in favour of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione on this agenda",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini
