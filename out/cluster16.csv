#PazzagliniGiuliano,Crazy people L SP PSd Az Mr President of course I welcome the call for a time limit to allow the final vote on the measure before the suspension but I do not think that I have a written statement to leave to the proceedings I should like to start by starting from the point of view that I have been given some inaccuracies which I have heard from some of my colleagues who have spoken earlier The process of the measure under consideration began during the Government Count 1 also participated by the League then developed in three further passages with changes introduced first in the reading of the Chamber of Deputies then again in the reading of the Senate and this has meant the lengthening of the times until today Thus four passages have been made in the parliamentary assemblies today's is the fourth and three different governments Having said that I think it is understandable to understand why there is already a deadline in the measure for which I presented an agenda to the Commission inviting the Government to remedy as soon as the measure is approved The agenda has also been signed by many other colleagues from the Commission 's territory environment environmental goods perhaps by everyone and will therefore ensure that as soon as the measure is enacted action can be taken to update this deadline Having undertaken to contract the time I will not go into the substance of the measure but I want to make some explicit references I am thinking for example of what is expressly indicated in Article 1 we are talking about the restoration of the marine ecosystem the promotion of the economy virtuous behavioral models and it is this last point that I think I should go into with a little reflection These measures are important to me because Article 1 expressly indicates an objective which has been achieved in part in mountain areas where the symbiosis man-territory has always developed making it clear that the uses traditions virtuous behaviours even regulated in acts which for example involved the obligation for the frontists to clean up the riverbed had to be replicated also in the waters including rivers since it is true that the provision is called saving the sea but also includes in it what happens on rivers lakes and indeed sea This allows me to reply to some of my colleagues who have regretted the lack of incentives for this which we would obviously have appreciated too but I do not know a farmer or operator who does not make improvements in the workplace or on his own ground if it is those who make agriculture Therefore to move from a system that implicitly first brought fishermen to put back into the sea the collected waste because it was special waste to a system that instead allows it to give them for disposal free of charge and without administrative difficulties because they are equated to ordinary waste like the waste of the ships I would say that it is a huge improvement I therefore would have appreciated if there had been contributions in this regard but as a person who comes from the mountain and knows that the care of his garden let 's call it improperly is responsibility before every person who carries out that activity but above all it is something that he does voluntarily in my opinion already in itself this justifies the fact that he hopes to be able to leave a better world to future generations as someone said with this measure In this sense I allow myself to open a small personal parenthesis because on the day of the completion of the eighteen years of my oldest daughter for me it is a pleasure as a father to be able to approve a measure that will help to create the possibility of leaving for her in fact a better world In compliance with the commitment to contract the times I start with the conclusions declaring the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Group Party of Action because we are aware that we are not trying a measure that alone will solve all the problems of the sea but this is called decree law and not magic wand or something that is not in our possibilities therefore pragmatically as a concrete person I recognize that there are limits and that it would have been possible to improve it further as is always possible for any measure but I believe that the innovation introduced with this measure with what will be possible to do after we have approved it alone justifies the fact that our vote will be favorable 11:49 a.m,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-21.991646,-0.23451656,16,crazy people l sp psd az mr

#CalderoliRoberto,The general debate is closed The Presidency has also deepened the issues raised by Senator De Petris in relation to time limits Article 138 of the Constitution states in the first paragraph that the laws of revision of the Constitution and other constitutional laws shall be adopted by two successive deliberations at an interval not less than three months Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure states that the second resolution provided for in Article 138 may be adopted only after three months after the adoption of the draft law in the same text transmitted or subsequently approved by the Chamber of Deputies In this respect the following paragraph 2 expressly states that the three months shall be counted in accordance with the common timetable The regulatory provision is therefore in perfect harmony with the principles on the calculation of the time limits in force in the general order that are explicit in Article 2963 of the Civil Code This provision stipulates in particular that the limitation periods provided for in this Code and in the other laws shall be calculated in accordance with the common timetable In addition in accordance with the principle that dies a quo non accountuur dies ad quem accountuur the second paragraph specifies that the day on which the initial time of the deadline falls is not calculated and the limitation occurs with the expiry of the last moment of the final day In particular with regard to the deadlines fixed on a monthly basis the fourth paragraph of Article 2963 states that The limitation to months shall occur in the month of expiry and on the day of the expiry corresponding to the day of the initial month and the last subparagraph shall specify that If that day is missing in the month of expiry the deadline shall be completed with the last day of the same month see paragraph 4 above The general nature of this principle is confirmed by the content of Article 155 of the Code of Civil Procedure Article 14 of the Criminal Code and Article 172 of the Code of Criminal Procedure based on the same principles The precedents we have found three of the Council of State and one of the Court of Cassation go in this direction as well as the three previous approvals of constitutional reforms were voted in second resolution on the day following the three months The Presidency will therefore after giving the floor to the rapporteur and the representative of the Government if they think they can speak postpone the explanations of vote and the final vote to the first useful sitting because it would make no sense for twenty four hours to see a dream that has seen us all so united and convinced As the rapporteur does not wish to speak I call the representative of the Government,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-20.86641,0.98227566,16,general debate closed presidency also deepened issues raised senator de petris relation time limits article 138 constitution states first paragraph laws revision constitution constitutional laws shall adopted two successive deliberations interval less three months rule 122 rules procedure states second resolution provided article 138 may adopted three months adoption draft law text transmitted subsequently approved chamber deputies respect following paragraph 2 expressly states three months shall counted accordance common timetable regulatory provision therefore perfect harmony principles calculation time limits force general order explicit article 2963 civil code provision stipulates particular limitation periods provided code laws shall calculated accordance common timetable addition accordance principle dies quo non accountuur dies ad quem accountuur second paragraph specifies day initial time deadline falls calculated limitation occurs expiry last moment final day particular regard deadlines fixed monthly basis fourth paragraph article 2963 states limitation months shall occur month expiry day expiry corresponding day initial month last subparagraph shall specify day missing month expiry deadline shall completed last day month see paragraph 4 general nature principle confirmed content article 155 code civil procedure article 14 criminal code article 172 code criminal procedure based principles precedents found three council state one court cassation go direction well three previous approvals constitutional reforms voted second resolution day following three months presidency therefore giving floor rapporteur representative government think speak postpone explanations vote final vote first useful sitting would make sense twenty four hours see dream seen us united convinced rapporteur wish speak call representative government
