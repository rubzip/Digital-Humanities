#MireiaBorrásPabón,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Mr Echenique I imagine that from the coat of vision is said by your former advisor Podemos Cristóbal Gallego Councillor of Enagas who has charged almost 70,000 euros in just six months I guess he says so for him Turning to the question today we are discussing a proposal for a law of the communist group of the House which like any communist initiative is limited to urging state control of anything in this case of hydroelectric plants to create a public energy company called Spanish energy production I wish this government could move the water through Spain with the same looseness with which the water dances to the communists separatists and bildutaras in order to keep itself at all costs in power But as we have explained more often a public energy company is not the solution to high energy prices In their proposal for a law they state that direct management of the hydroelectric fleet through a public undertaking could solve the high price of the electricity bill That is literally what they say in their proposal Well this is simply a lie Perhaps it was the solution to put your friends and family in another little chiringuito I do n't doubt that but certainly not to lower the electric bill to the Spaniards Besides we have numerous examples it 's not something that says VOX We have many examples such as that of Italy with its public company paying an average price higher than in Spain or that of France where the Government has just announced a recapitalisation for more than EUR 2 billion due precisely to the economic difficulties of its public energy company or that of Mexico with very high electricity prices four blackouts in the last three years and its public energy company in technical bankruptcy But without going so far the public electricity of his fellow Kichi in Cadiz Eléctrica de Cadiz has been forced like any other private company to raise prices in order to avoid incurring losses Ladies and gentlemen the only difference between a public and a private enterprise is that the public is subject to the interests of politicians and the private to the interests of the market which we are all citizens of this country In addition a public energy company only ensures that costs and risks are borne by the money of all Spaniards and does not offer any added advantage to private management If today there was a public company composed of all the hydroelectric plants in Spain the price of energy would continue to set historical peaks every day Why Very simple because it would continue to operate in a regulated European market with the same rules for everyone regardless of whether management is public or private So gentlemen of Podemos stop diverting attention from the real problem which is you your political decisions and those of this government Those are the ones that have caused and continue to cause an increase in the price of energy and not the ownership of the companies that manage it Ladies and gentlemen what would happen if we had right now operating the nuclear power plants shut down by bipartisanism What would happen if we could continue to count in this energy crisis with the coal thermal power plants that you so hastened to shut down Do you think we'd be in this situation Well surely not And surely the reservoirs would not have been emptied by high electricity prices either The decision of the electricians to empty the reservoirs in summer has caused the water reserves to be already less than half when the average in the last ten years for these dates has always been more than 60 This is particularly worrying in southern Spain in communities such as Andalusia where they are only 30 or in Murcia 22 This situation is also exacerbated by the lack of infrastructure necessary to bring water to all regions and to co-ordinate the nation indeed by the repeal by the PSOE of the transfer of the Ebro in the National Hydrological Plan We know that companies have economic interests it is true which sometimes leads to neglect of other issues relating to the common good such as the environmental impact or economic activity and the way of life of the regions especially in rural Spain But what are the politicians for ladies and gentlemen Who is directly responsible for these reservoirs Who has allowed companies to empty them even if they can avoid it Hydrographic confederations And on whom do hydrographic confederations depend Lords of Podemos and Government Of the same public administration that for example authorized the emptying of reservoirs such as that of Ricobayo in Zamora or that of Valdecañas in Cáceres And we still have to listen to the government and the minister of energy ruin and demographic hell complaining about something that depends on their own ministry Amazing If the Administration is not even able to properly manage this irregular use so that companies do not exploit the reservoirs to this point how will they be able to ensure their optimal and efficient management They apply the same hypocrisy to everything as they sink this country They regret the unorthodox prices of energy while practicing a suicidal energy policy that attacks our energy sovereignty They close nuclear and coal plants in Spain and then import nuclear and coal energy from countries such as France and Morocco It would only be necessary for you gentlemen of the Government to talk about human rights by negotiating with terrorists Oh no I 'm sorry they 're already doing this They are the face of an unbearable cynicism with a president of the government who lands in Ciudad Real in a Super Puma helicopter which spends an average of 600 litres of kerosene at the hour to demand a green and renewable energy consumption from citizens who impoverish and ruin every day to supposedly combat climate change I 'm running out of adjectives for you ladies and gentlemen There is plenty of water for all the provinces in Spain and what we must do is to ensure that every drop reaches every corner of the country through a national hydrological plan Not only do we have to make sure that the wifi which comes too but it must first reach all regions In addition it should be reconsidered whether with the current energy mix water should continue to be devoted to electricity generation or whether it has greater value for other uses such as human agricultural tourism etc. which have no substitution and of course energy storage Make it clear and I will finish Madam President that in VOX we will not allow the rights of the Spaniards to be restricted by invoking their false and globalist Agenda 2030 We will promote through the interconnection of all the basins a green and prosperous Spain that guarantees industrial development compatible with the environmental sustainability and well being of all Spaniards",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,44.797115,-4.4344673,34,"good afternoon ladies gentlemen mr echenique

#MireiaBorrásPabón,Thank you President Good afternoon deputies This government has already managed to make us here today in this Chamber part of 10 of the Spaniards who can afford to have their home at a more or less decent temperature at a temperature comparable to that which we also have in this Chamber about 27 degrees 27 comfortable degrees which allow us to be here today in this Chamber practically in short sleeves We can be here practically in short sleeves while millions of Spaniards in their homes can't turn on the heating That is why you legislate as you legislate because you do not suffer the consequences of your ideological and sectarian policies it is the Spaniards who bear them Ladies and gentlemen we have gas deposits in Spain for over 40 years we have the world 's second largest uranium reserves we have in the Canary Islands the world 's largest deposits of telurium a key mineral for solar energy but what is the government doing The Government prohibited by law the exploitation of that gas the Government prohibited by law the exploitation of that uranium for nuclear energy and the Government de facto handed over the canary deposits to Moroccan expansionism How long does the megawatt hour have to come gentlemen of the government for you to react at once And by the way the gas that Spain will receive from the United States is the result of fracking which is forbidden in Spain also for you The energy we receive from France and Morocco produced with nuclear and coal is generated with the same power stations that you here today close and demonize every day And says the PSOE spokesman that we have to abandon fossil fuels as soon as possible Yeah to make a difference of course They want to abandon them to import them because they do not think enough of the energy dependence that we have already suffered in Spain 75 a tremendously high energy dependence and that because of this government we will be able to increase and worsen a dependence that impoverishes us and weakens us as a nation We are beating all the records ladies and gentlemen including the index of misery in the developed world where we already occupy the first place because with this government we have the highest inflation in our history the highest public debt in our history the most expensive bill of light in our history By the way are you also going to put all this in Pedro Sánchez 's new Netflix series I 'm sure you do are n't you But let 's talk about energy do n't let me sleep here with the summery temperature we have in the Chamber It is good to facilitate the development of hydrogen in Spain of course it improves and diversifys our energy sovereignty Making the most of all our resources strengthens us as a nation and it is also vital to put them at the service of Spain and the Spaniards to defend ours Because if we were to depend on our own ladies and gentlemen we would not be so foolish as to be the only country that by law prohibits the exploitation and research of its own resources wasting enormous productive potential causing a possible shortage of raw materials for industry and causing even more misery to all Spaniards If we depended on it this government would not be flying thermal power plants in the midst of an energy crisis to kneel down to climate fanaticism which threatens our rural world and our industry Sidef Let 's say ours ladies and gentlemen it will not give more than EUR 20 billion to its gender ideology while giving 20 cents per litre to our transporters who just want to work And above all we would not have reached this situation of national crisis to which all of you have led us How many demonstrations with almost half a million people need to start working and offer solutions to the Spaniards But of course all the protesters are now of the far right ladies and gentlemen now if you fight for your children 's bread this government points you to the ultra and the facha Do you know what kind of ultras we are in VOX We are ultras in demanding urgent solutions to the misery that you provoke we are ultras in demanding an immediate reduction of taxes on electricity and hydrocarbons and we are ultras in advancing our energy sovereignty and in ensuring the transparency of every public euro invested as we have already proposed in our amendments to which of course as VOX puts it you will vote against even if you are of full common sense And finally ladies and gentlemen the only shock plan that works in this country is for you to resign as a bloc and do it now Call for general elections now Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,45.276085,-1.4406514,34,thank president good afternoon deputies government already managed make us today chamber part 10 spaniards afford home

#MireiaBorrásPabón,Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen minister Madam Minister I wish you were able to control the price of energy with the same eagerness that Pedro Sánchez wants to control Indra Post Offices the INE the CIS I wish but unfortunately it 's not After all the political verborrhea that you have released us here given it kills story I will sum up your energy policy in two minutes 165 euros fill an average tank of petrol 76 euros the average bill of light in June already applied its wonderful Iberian exception 10 higher than the month of May without its wonderful Iberian exception 3 euros per litre the price of the fuel to which we will surely arrive this summer 500 gas stations that have already had to close and hundreds that are already on the verge of bankruptcy because their government has forced them to act as banks 10.2 the rate of inflation fulminating any measure that they have been able to apply to date 2000 million euros increases their collection for each percentage point that rises in inflation and 14 billion euros is paid to this government only with the increase of electricity and revenues for CO2 emissions And how much does this government give back to the Spanish Zero zero euros And how much do they aim to alleviate the effects of their disastrous energy policy Not half of everything they collect with the rise of the energy bill nor with their tax reduction policies which we have been told here today nor with their subsidy to diesel This is the X -ray of the looting of this government 's energy policy The ruined Spaniards broken because of their policies and you 're breaking all the collection records Thus this government can afford to promise millions of euros for video games millions of euros to renew trade union seats to encourage illegal immigration or to target more than 20 billion euros to keep gender bars come on measures buy votes to try to curb this government 's debacle And in the meantime we continue to lead the countries with the greatest deficit the highest public debt higher inflation and the highest unemployment rate in the European Union That 's what you call a very chulsian scenario for the Spaniards Minister you know you can still lower the price bill much more they have much more room to keep going down Why do n't they Wait because he does n't leave Europe We could not lower the VAT on electricity because it did not leave Europe but it was enough an unprecedented electoral defeat in Andalusia so that it did not take them 24 hours to announce the reduction of VAT which they supposedly could not do And now they intend to apply effective measures such as raising taxes to electricity when they know that this is not going to solve the problem of the millions of households and companies that cannot simply pay their bill for light Of course the electrics must tie their shoulders and they must be part of the solution of course we can even discuss whether this measure can be more or less just but ladies and gentlemen does it tackle the problem Is the electric bill reduced to the Spanish No no Who benefits from this measure To you to this government only to you Is your anti-crisis package a package of measures to save the Spanish or to save Sánchez the autocrat Ladies and gentlemen the light has been out of control as you know for over a year now long before Putin began to invade Ukraine The electric bill began to cover press headlines in the middle of Filomena Do you remember minister Do you remember that it 's a temporary and short term fact Do you remember as we warned you over and over again from VOX about the risks and the risks we were faced with with their ideological policies It was January 2021 and since then the price has not stopped rising as this government looked elsewhere VOX wants to be the voice of common sense in this House We are against their climate policies which we call climate fanaticism because only a fanatic is capable of harming their country at all costs applying measures in the name of the survival of the planet without any coherent or technical basis This should be heard in particular by those Members ladies and gentlemen who came to this rostrum yesterday before the motion we tabled from my group and again gave a false and distorted message of what VOX is defending Because in VOX we have the humility enough to know that we do not have all the answers to the climate change debate or to the temperature change on the planet But you know what That you do n't have them either We just refuse to accept inconsistent policies hypocritical and sectarian policies which is very different from what you said in this rostrum yesterday VOX wants to preserve and conserve the environment of course certainly more than you do but its ideological policies do not apply ecology they use it to empty our pockets In VOX we believe yes in a Europe that defends the interests of the Spanish even if the globalists call this anti-Europeanism And yes we are critical of any sectarian policy that goes against the interests of the Spanish We try to apply common sense and from what we see every day in this House there is only VOX left to denounce the absence of this sense in the crazy policies that the Government implements And if not explain to me here today what criterion is behind banning research and exploitation of our resources to import them more expensive than other countries Explain to me Minister what technical criterion is behind a hasty shutdown of nuclear power plants in Spain knowing that it is a firm and clean technology and on which we depend What logical criterion is behind flying thermal power plants in Spain to buy coal energy from other countries such as Morocco You have spoken about fundamental problems but this Government has tried to solve all energy problems without going to the fundamental problem which is nothing other than its own climate and ideological policies The result the gasoline becoming more expensive and the bill of light constantly rising This Government instead of attacking the origin of the problem is dedicated to intervening in the outcome Go to the origin minister and listen to me well pay attention to me which then says we do n't propose anything They demand first of all to curb the speculative market for CO2 emissions which greatly increases the energy bill And until they do they start returning to the Spaniards every euro of the millions of euros that the government is pocketing with CO2 allowances or dedicate themselves directly to lowering the bill The tonnage of CO2 has increased from EUR 7 in 2012 to more than EUR 80 in 2022 which is causing for example that our thermal power plants are not profitable and that for this reason we have to import energy from coal plants from Morocco because of course they do not pay CO2 To all the climate change gurus present in this House I ask what happens if the emissions are emitted by Morocco do not affect the atmosphere Explain it to me Is it so hard to understand that we can't get rid of technologies that we depend on At least let 's do it until we stop depending on them Is it so hard to understand What we must ask Europe Minister is not to limit the price of gas but an urgent reform in the wholesale electricity pricing market the design of which causes us to be paying these astronomical prices in the electricity bill It is not a question of applying games of trilers such as their Iberian exception it is a question of demanding and proposing a structural reform that will stop condemning our country to ruin and energy misery Why do they not propose for example to take the gas completely out of the marginalist market It would be a much more effective ambitious and efficient measure that would indeed significantly lower the bill Another issue is to have all our strategic resources and a balanced energy mix that offers low prices security and firmness Minister one out of every five times that the light is on in Spain nuclear energy is consumed and you not only suffocate the nuclear sector but in turn cause a diplomatic crisis with our main gas supplier Algeria or give the Sahara to Morocco damaging our claims on numerous millionaire natural resources such as the Tropic underwater volcano which has fifty thousand times more tellurium than there is usually in the deposits of this metal on land Minister I 'm not surprised that you do n't look at me and that you only know how to look down when I speak to you because no one who has done to Spain the damage that you are doing to you can look to another place other than the ground Minister One last curiosity On the NATO dinner menu we saw olives red tuna mustard brochettes

#MireiaBorrásPabón,Thank you President Minister your lifesaver does n't work either to save you or the Spaniards Moreover as has already been said they are sinking into sectors as important as cogeneration which has fallen by 50 even though it is an essential technology for industry In case it were not enough the sticks on the wheels and the constant attacks that this Government is receiving they are now also attacking its main power source which is also one of the most efficient In just two weeks since the application of its wonderful Iberian exception they have stopped producing 5 of electricity in Spain The problem does not have it with me Minister and spokesman of the Socialist Party they have it with the reality of the data that we have been telling them here by the various Members that we are going through arguing one by one why their measures do not work They have n't reduced the bill for the light They lied promising a 20 discount Where 's that discount Stop telling stories stop telling us stories here Where 's the discount they promised us Where is he It 's not it 's just not By the way to the socialist deputy upset because he mentioned the diet of the 2030 Agenda it can be seen that he would have preferred worms right to ceviche and prawns I would also like to say to the Socialist Party of course that we know what congestion rents are Even if you 're very smart the rest of us also know in fact we talked about it last week You must be more attentive to what is said in this rostrum that you are being beaten by your minister 's bad education But it is also that once the congestion rents have been discounted which is what we say according to the data the French system continues to pay almost half a million euros a day Spanish consumers in fact are subsidizing energy in France and Portugal Electrical interconnections with French territory are operating from the start of its energy island to the maximum of its capacity Portugal has also decreased national production of gas based electricity because it is supplying it with the energy that imports from Spain avoiding its consumers paying the compensation of the gas companies because we already pay all the Spanish It 's the first time I 've seen ladies and gentlemen I have to admit how a discount increases the final price To solve the problem is to have a 200 increase in the wholesale price of electricity compared to a year ago Is that solving the problem You however as you have indicated are very satisfied with your measures and I am not surprised because considering that you have a President of the Government who considers it a good result to have thirty seven corpses in the Melilla fence which is a well solved one I am not surprised that it seems a good result to you If thirty seven corpses according to your government is a good result I do n't know what would have been fifty corpses magnificent sensational If they had protected the southern border as we have been warning them for years our civilian guards would not be assaulted on a daily basis and we would not have to regret massive flows of illegal immigration that lead to death You know it and you do n't do anything Once again VOX was right just as we warned them You have caused the biggest energy economic and social crisis in our country with consequences that all Spaniards suffer while you continue to comfortably depreciate our resources and stifle nuclear power With a completely outdated PIC which you mentioned based on an electric power park with a gas at 20 euros when today it is over 100 and a shutdown of the nuclear park in the midst of this energy crisis that we simply cannot afford They also despise science and innovation and the mini-nuclears already planned by the way all over the planet except in Spain Three hundred micro-reactors planned in the United States until 2050 others in China France the United Kingdom Canada Do you know Minister that Morocco is also investing in nuclear energy Rejoice because within a time Moroccans will also be able to sell us the nuclear energy they generate in their power plants much more expensive than we would because we will have closed them already Rejoice minister because it seems that this government wants to destroy every productive sector of this country from oranges to grain and even fuel itself In Spain we do not even study mononuclears we paralyze million dollar farms of natural resources and we do not allow gas to be removed from our soils because for what if we can already buy it much more expensive to Americans French or Moroccans In addition I will tell you one last thing and I finish Spain is the third country in Europe with more mining resources but they are not exploited by ecological pressures,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,46.380028,-1.386634,34,thank president minister lifesaver n't work either save spaniards moreover already said sinking sectors important cogeneration

#MireiaBorrásPabón,Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen minister We are here by a royal decree that they present with a title full of grandiose words such as promoting electric mobility or promoting self consumption in short the constant political verborrea to which this Government has accustomed us But first of all I would like to ask you whether you see it normal to mix in the same royal decree questions on the energy sector the Cooperatives Act the Social Security Act with the reduction of the VAT on masks which by the way applies only to surgical masks of course because to the most expensive ones to the FFP2 with which this government most collects they do not apply a reduction of VAT even if they are the ones that most protect citizens especially in the interior spaces This royal decree is a clear example of how this is not only the government of improvisation and legislative splendour but also an elephantic government oversized full of bureaucracy and client networks which only knows how to stop the little wealth that allows the Spaniards to generate from being destined to pay salaries of politicians as expendable and unnecessary as you Minister They claim in this royal decree to have identified some factors that hinder the expansion of renewable energies Have you bought a mirror Minister You blame this text first on the difficulties of access to transport and distribution networks and secondly on the bureaucratic difficulties and inability of the Administration to process a large number of projects But minister who are responsible who create these difficulties You guys At least with this royal decree they recognize the hellish bureaucracy they generate and that it is a problem that discourages the development of the energy sector But what about the rest of the sectors the persistent bureaucratic tyranny in the rest of the fields such as for example the research centres in this country the granting of aid with European funds administrative licences etc Do n't these deserve the attention of the government You include in this royal decree the extension of tax rebates on the electric bill of the Spaniards something that we support in VOX which as you know we have been asking since the first day we stepped on Congress but in our case we advocate permanent not temporary measures as you propose and also much more ambitious such as the introduction of a super reduced VAT of 4 on the electric bill for the Spanish households Today you are extending 10 of the household electricity bill but that is totally insufficient because it is still one of the highest VAT in the European Union VOX proposes a structural reform that would greatly reduce the electricity bill of the Spanish but you prefer to create ration cards which you call social bonds to subsidise the energy poverty that this government causes Then they are outraged when we call them chavistas minister Having said that it is important to talk about the installation of charging points for electric vehicles yes but it is also important to assess the problems associated with this authoritarian transition to the electric vehicle Do you understand that in this transition to electric mobility there are thousands of Spaniards who can lose their jobs as a result for example of the disappearance of workshops and manufacturers of spare parts or components such as chassis transmissions and non-electronic equipment or that without specific plans to install large battery plants in Spain the automotive sector will be losing even more than 40 of the added value for each vehicle that becomes electric What do you intend to do Minister to save the thousands of jobs and mitigate the impact of electric mobility on the car industry when we are the second largest producing country in Europe And with regard to the environment which they seem to be so concerned about what recycling plan do they have for when they flood our country with huge heavy polluting batteries I 'm telling you none Why do they not encourage for example other types of fuels such as biofuels which do not need batteries and are also so essential for industrial transport for heavy and long distance transport The answer is that industry jobs and the environment are alike Last morning Thursday Spain will stop producing aluminum because the 512 tanks of electrolysis in San Cibrao in Lugo will be turned from being the European jewel in the sector to being a company without activity and all because the price of electricity in this country already assumed a quarter of the cost of production and this does not count on the risks of energy supply which pose problems as badly managed by you as the pipeline of Algeria the urgent purchase of 180 000 tons of coal that will burn the central of As Pontes or that we have fired the import of oil and gas from the United States in a long number of misconceptions that have caused insurmountable bills for any sector enterprise self employed or average family in this country In short this royal decree is a further demonstration of how the government improvises and starts the house on the roof trying to first impose electric mobility on the Spaniards without even having enough unloading infrastructure And it is surprising to see how their policies lead to money transfers from lower rents to higher rents which are precisely the ones that buy these electric vehicles Can you explain to me Minister why a worker or self employed person who moves by bus or subway and perhaps not even arrive at the end of the month have to subsidize with the money of his taxes the expenses of a new electric car to the highest class in this country Is the government going to leave Disney 's policy and fight for the Spaniards Or are you going to keep making the bed to Pedro Sánchez 's globalism and personal agenda I finish Minister with a very simple question one that any worker head of family or self employed person would do to him in my place and it is what he does there sitting having failed and having made the lives of the Spaniards so much worse Lift up take your suitcase and resign and at least recover some of the personal dignity that this Government has long lost Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,40.855618,-5.200936,34,thank president good afternoon ladies

#JulioUtrillaCano,Thank you very much President Ladies and gentlemen you are bringing us here today a proposal for a law for a future source of energy very much in the future because it is true that you still have a long way to go at a time of an energy context in ancient Spain where the energy policy of this government is a major waste another They are unable to find a solution that will alleviate the unstoppable price escalation which is leading to unbearable suffering for Spanish households by deceiving the citizens by saying that Brussels should give the approval to the tax reduction when by then half of Europe had already lowered the VAT on fuels by defachingly accusing Putin of being the only culprit of the price increase by not apologizing for a series of measures which have not managed to alleviate the situation not a single word of self criticism gentlemen they are incompetent to announce the intervention of the price of gas with which they intended to lower the receipt of the light of the Spaniards and which has served absolutely nothing In short a new ridiculous one more of this nefarious government But gentlemen of the PP in the successive governments that you have led they did not want to change things either they did not address any structural changes in energy policy they did not promote any connectivity with Europe they continued to shut down nuclear power stations Does that sound like you Garoña gentlemen of the PP He had a useful life until 2031 and Rajoy in campaign assured that if he ruled he would never close it And I already believe it closed down drowned by the taxes and taxes that your government imposed on you It 's been many years working for Garoña 's closure Those of us who have fought for it today we are pleased to have finally achieved it This was said by a politician currently in his ranks in the Senate And what about the rise in fuel VAT in 2018 from 18 to 21 He never retreated again Do n't forget you have a share of responsibility in all of this Look the future goes through cleaner energies is absolutely obvious and with what VOX fully agrees just as evident that the pace that climate fanaticism has imposed on us is excessive utopian and realistic zero and that is why we are paying for the consequences Come up here gentlemen and explain why with similar prices in the barrel of Brent in 2008 or 2011 gasoline cost 1.25 euros almost half what it costs now Tell the truth to the Spaniards that the market is tense to the extreme because they have had the great idea of minimizing refining capacity to reach their longing ecological transition as soon as possible Or explain why we shut down and blow up coal thermals fifteen years before the Brussels demands while the green Germany is developing the coal plants that were by the way dormant and in reserve Here we fly them through the air and there they reserve them That energy creation in the future will be a combination of various technologies is obvious and that hydrogen is going to be part of that set of energies we do not know in what form or in what percentage also undoubtedly is a reality Nor is there any doubt that legislation is needed to move forward and to create a regulatory framework to create legal stability for investors But gentlemen of the PP I fear that you for wanting to move forward have lost all perspective as there is currently no hydrogen market It 's reality And the doubts and uncertainties of the sector are so much that creating a fast and running legal framework can generate more confusion than it already exists today At the point where we are it might be better to move forward in legislation to provide direct aid and economic and fiscal incentives for the development of specific projects production transport storage and consumption facilities and to facilitate the promotion of such projects with clear and unique procedures throughout the national territory In addition ladies and gentlemen there are issues that we cannot share with you The law is underdeveloped Most points are very inconclusive In many areas it is said that it will be the agency in charge that will develop or promote In short it lacks concreteness because in fact there are still many points to be defined and there are very few certainties in the sector The law is a copy of the law of electricity and hydrocarbons and there are many topics such as the approval of hydrogen vehicles approval of installations safety and quality transport storage etc. for which it is proposed to use the existing regulations In VOX we believe that we are at the best time to analyze what is good for us and in general to develop custom regulations for hydrogen in all cases You identify the technical manager of the system Enagas who has to be so for installation transport and exclusive distribution which is supposed to be in most cases private Why Why not allow other distributors for example regional distributors to do so as well They also speak in all cases of green hydrogen Why do other technologies such as the generation of pink hydrogen from nuclear energy or even grey which is much more competitive and today the numbers can come out In Germany I remind you that there are more than one hundred hydrogens that use grey hydrogen For what To develop a market to launch a sector that is still very green indeed and in which unfortunately green hydrogen costs between two and three times as much as grey hydrogen On the other hand in their law they do not mention cogeneration which would be key in this whole process It is difficult to mark the right point of when to legislate but in our view you have advanced and as the saying goes haste is never good counselors Finally ladies and gentlemen in Congress we must be extremely rigorous with what we are talking about You make errors of package and concept in your chapter III They say textually that grey hydrogen is produced from methane and in whose production CO2 emissions are generated No ladies and gentlemen grey hydrogen is generated from natural gas which is not the same as methane it is the same molecule but it is not the same because there is biomethane and green hydrogen can be generated from it Green hydrogen defines it as hydrogen produced from water from renewable energy sources But there are other ways of obtaining green hydrogen such as the reformation of biomethane that I have just commented on or the gasification or pyrolysis of waste The latter produce neutral hydrogen in CO2 which is also green hydrogen ladies and gentlemen Really it 's all about getting fully involved but you 've gone beyond these definitions,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,43.43224,-3.9652739,34,thank much president ladies gentlemen bringing us today

#PatriciaRuedaPerelló,Good afternoon Mr Errejón 's party is bringing us an initiative on banning the advertising of polluting vehicles Spain is a leader in youth unemployment in Europe it has an insurmountable public debt and an outpouring of inflation a fiscal persecution of Spaniards who are having a very bad time and who cannot pay the autonomous quota or the bill for light gas gasoline or diesel closure of businesses and mass layoffs relocation energy dependence attacks on tourism the primary sector industry But in the explanatory statement of this initiative they say Combating climate change is the fundamental pillar that must guide the actions emanating from this transformative process The fundamental pillar should be to implement effective policies that guarantee the prosperity of the Spaniards and not the new climate religion that the globalist elites seek to impose those who travel on a private jet to talk about climate change and that everyone buys except VOX We have a government that has incorporated communists separatists and philotetras into the leadership of the state that tramples on our Constitution violating rights and freedoms with the states of alarm and the closure of Congress that confronts and ruins the Spaniards that comes to terms with lies that threatens Spain And you Mr. Errejon are your crutch and accomplice So when in his initiative he comes to say that there should be no room for the use of fossil fuels say for example to Laureano who is early every day to serve his livestock and his land land that works hard on the Palentine mountain thanks to his tractor tractor that works on fossil fuel in case the ecologists of carpet do not know how tractors work By the way I recommend seeing the documentary La España silenced which will bring you closer to reality and you will also meet Andrea who in Soria takes her car to go to the car factory where she and her mother work a factory which will close to continue with the ideological delusions made of green sending to misery young and not so young Spain is closing factories as a result of the 2030 Agenda and climate impositions while Asia wins the race and gets rich Stop complicating the lives of the Spaniards Of course air quality needs to be improved but there is no need for a new ban There is no need for a new blow to a sector that is strategic for Spain His friends from the government have already beaten him they beat him when they attack the diesel when they raise tuition taxes or when they come late in the aid of the PERT VEC the one in which they have left many SMEs out And now they 're looking for a new blow with a new ban Mr Errejón there are many reasons to vote against your initiative Spain is experiencing an economic and health crisis and the priority is not to ban advertising a sector in which thousands of self employed people work which has great creatives and in which we are international references In Spain the automotive sector is the first contributor to the trade balance accounts for 10 of GDP and generates two million fixed and quality direct and indirect jobs In addition stop demonizing because in this sector we talk about manufacturers suppliers distributors dealers workshops components not counting communication agencies and media and everyone is threatened by this initiative It is also incongruent to advance the deadlines set by national and European standards because Spain already has a very demanding regulation and the electric vehicle has a very high price I mean I do n't know how people with lower incomes are gonna do it Are you worried about emissions So work on policies that allow vehicle renewal This will also help to reduce emissions and improve road safety because Spain has one of the oldest car parks in Europe We are not going to allow them to come and tell us how we have to move what to eat or how we have to think nor to tell us what the rise in taxes and prohibitions are the solution And you 're not the solution because you 're all part of the problem And as part of the problem I guarantee you that VOX is here to take away your faces that we do not deny and to work every minute of our life to give back to the Spaniards the hope and the future that you have all taken away from them We will work with our Spanish agenda always in defense of the interests of the nation and rebuild everything they have destroyed sooner than later Thank you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,44.309994,-1.0866697,34,good afternoon mr errejón 's party bringing us initiative banning advertising

#PatriciaRuedaPerelló,Thank you President The People 's Party brings us an initiative in which it tells the Government to assume its share of responsibility in the energy emergency There is no doubt about that but what about your responsibility People 's Party They talk about tax cuts but I remind them that they govern by absolute majority and instead of lowering taxes they raised it Today the Spanish pay the consequences of their decisions You are responsible for what you call the climate emergency the rise in energy prices the closure of nuclear power plants and you are responsible for your weakness and hypocrisy and we have seen it again with your abstention from the energy poverty initiative that brought VOX to this House PP and PSOE with their climate policies have caused energy dependence and have installed Spain in total insecurity and lack of competitiveness and stability Ladies and gentlemen while you take on climate fanaticism out there the Spaniards are cold because you have to choose between eating or turning on the heating Many do not know how they are going to pay the bill for light gas fuel or feed for livestock as they go up and up the shopping cart There are empty shelves in supermarkets the highest inflation in the last thirty years public debt beating all records These are the most churning things of this Government as Minister Díaz would say Spanish ruined by the climate laws and the harmful politics of the government Spanish more and more who do not accept neither the crumbs of the government of the ruin nor who sell it to the unions of the shellfish Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards want bread not crumbs and therefore are on the streets defending their children 's bread The street speaks we have seen it in the last mass demonstrations They had to be thrown out they were screaming A government that lies impoverishes and manipulates must be thrown out a government that ruins the Spanish speaks to terrorists to whom it calls moderate and not to transporters to whom they call the far right It is a government that wants them to work below the cost price i.e. work costs them money A government that does not lower taxes but spends 350 000 euros in the summer palace of Sánchez and 21 billion euros on the whims of the feminist moquette minister A government that abandons transporters farmers farmers fishermen hoteliers hoteliers taxi drivers bus drivers men and women while giving millions of euros to Chavista airlines shellfish unions and friendly media as well as millions for advisors and ministries for advertising and waste The pandemic has taught us a lot among which dependence on the outside makes us vulnerable Spain must have its raw materials it must strengthen its energy economic food industrial and military sovereignty We 've been saying it for years and now we hear them talking about it Welcome to the path of common sense We have strongly criticized the submission to the 2030 Agenda which impoverishes us and makes us dependent and for thinking differently they call us negatists Non-realistic negatists as real is that the receipt of light has risen and that it is much more difficult to fill the deposit of a family or professional vehicle as real is that energy is a strategic element for the national security of any country so that a nation is free for the international strength of Spain for the development of industry for the well being of the population and for the very continuity of the nation how real it is that PP and PSOE are the same and assume climate fanaticism in the same way and therefore they will have to answer to the Spaniards Spain is first Our compatriots are the first and given their spurious interests and their 2030 agenda only remains VOX and our Spain Agenda His traps every day deceive less Spaniards and no we wo n't shut up or be afraid We will vote yes to the fuel tax drop and we will continue to defend in the courts in the streets and in the institutions

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Good night We discussed an initiative that is quite interesting although it mixes quite a few ideas that seem in themselves different as it speaks of the costs of light and gas of the electro intensive industry of the registration tax of a regasifier located in the port of El Musel in Gijón as well as of the aluminum processing plants the ancient Alcoa These are issues that may seem very different from each other but they have a thread industry The way in which the present group has expressed this even the groups which have intervened in the afternoon and in the sitting also show a fairly clear thing we are all aware that Spain and Spanish industry are going through absolutely critical and highly complicated moments The present is very dark for Spanish industry However and then I will explain myself there is hope In my view on the issue of light and gas the nuclear point of that price of light and gas has not been addressed,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,45.436436,-5.781348,34,good night discussed initiative quite interesting although mixes quite ideas seem different speaks costs light gas electro intensive industry registration tax regasifier located port el musel gijón well aluminum processing plants ancient alcoa issues may seem different thread industry way present group expressed even groups intervened afternoon sitting also show fairly clear thing aware spain spanish industry going absolutely critical highly complicated moments present dark spanish industry however explain hope view issue light gas nuclear point price light gas addressed
#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,The reason is nothing other than the radical and irrational policies of this Government with regard to climate religion They believe that on the basis of these climate dogmas which by the way are imposed by the Spanish electorate not by the interests of Spain but that they are imposed basically by the European Commission they believe that everything is good and everything can be justified Because of these policies that light and gas are being applied they are at the prices they are at So businessmen who have their restaurant know that this bill of light that is multiplying is the fault of the policies of the Socialist Party supported by Podemos erratic and absolutely unbridled with regard to that climate religion Mr. Farmer you have to keep the milk you work with with which you earn bread every day you have to keep it in those huge refrigerators that consume a lot of electric energy if you can't survive and can't carry your business forward know that it 's because of that Socialist Party and Podemos The electro intensive industry is absolutely related to this issue an industry in which at normal times I speak of a concrete example of Asturias which I have been able to analyse 45 of its expenditure corresponds to electricity when around 50 euros per megawatt hour is around Today the light is around 200 euros megawatt hour That is to say what used to be 50 is now around 70 of its expenditure This implies that this industry which is the same as Alcoa for example is no longer at all profitable What 's going on That the industry necessarily closes and the Spaniards go to the street and this industry automatically moves to India or China countries with a much more lax regulation and which does benefit its workers They 're talking enrollment tax Well it 's just that the tuition tax has been increased with a legal trifle,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,46.101517,-4.1344733,34,reason nothing radical irrational policies government regard climate religion believe basis climate dogmas way imposed spanish electorate interests spain imposed basically european commission believe everything good everything justified policies light gas applied prices businessmen restaurant know bill light multiplying fault policies socialist party supported podemos erratic absolutely unbridled regard climate religion mr. farmer keep milk work earn bread every day keep huge refrigerators consume lot electric energy can't survive can't carry business forward know 's socialist party podemos electro intensive industry absolutely related issue industry normal times speak concrete example asturias able analyse 45 expenditure corresponds electricity around 50 euros per megawatt hour around today light around 200 euros megawatt hour say used 50 around 70 expenditure implies industry alcoa example longer profitable 's going industry necessarily closes spaniards go street industry automatically moves india china countries much lax regulation benefit workers 're talking enrollment tax well 's tuition tax increased legal trifle

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,I hear laughter on the socialist bench which is something that continues to impress me I do not understand how in the face of the situation that transport in Spain is suffering you are still able to laugh We have talked about the measures included in this initiative throughout the day and the parliamentary groups in this House have devoted themselves to ridiculing VOX Basically the Socialist Party comes and says to us No it 's just that you 're proposing to lower taxes as if this were where will the money come from From where You Socialists are a true example of the management of public flows and together with you the People 's Party I will give you the details because this directive the directive from which the hydrocarbon tax comes out is adopted in 2003 In 2003 for an idea to be made the diesel was at 70 cents today almost twenty years later we have the diesel at almost 2 euros That has been the result of this directive a directive which is expressly intended as it says in its explanatory statement to discourage the use of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons And you will think logically transport which is an essential element for the supply and supply of all consumers in Europe will be exempt No gentlemen transport is specifically recorded by the rules laid down in this directive This directive states that the diesel tax has to be 33 cents per litre it is a fixed one it is not a variable that today several parliamentary groups have been confused and yet the Spanish Government has set it at 38 cents per litre You 're always more papists than the pope You always go one step ahead expressing to whom The users of the diesel who will already tell me must be the rich must indeed be the most wealthy The question is that Spain needs to tighten its belt because again and I give it the dates in 2003 when this directive is adopted Spain 's external debt was EUR 400 billion And you will say this directive approves new tax rates new revenues that were not before the Spanish accounts are probably healthier since then No on the contrary the debt today is EUR 1 400 billion i.e. the debt has been multiplied by three by three despite all the additional revenue The problem is that you are disguised as doctors in economics and come here to teach us lessons It gives us lessons from the Socialist Party which I shall now speak of and it gives us lessons to Bildu to Bildu The terrorists those who have Arnaldo Otegi and David Pla the last military leader of ETA in their directive those terrorists the parliamentary group of ETA in Congress come and dare to give economic lessons and dare to talk about taxes revolutionary taxes must be of which they know And the Socialist Party comes and tells us Where are you going to get the money Socialists you are a true manifest expert in squandering public money They spent EUR 680 million on the Andalusian unemployed in a single corruption case You can get the money out of here to lower taxes,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,41.11315,-3.159673,34,hear laughter socialist bench something continues impress understand face situation transport spain suffering still able laugh talked measures included initiative throughout day parliamentary groups house devoted ridiculing vox basically socialist party comes says us 's 're proposing lower taxes money come socialists true example management public flows together people 's party give details directive directive hydrocarbon tax comes adopted 2003 2003 idea made diesel 70 cents today almost twenty years later diesel almost 2 euros result directive directive expressly intended says explanatory statement discourage use fossil fuels hydrocarbons think logically transport essential element supply supply consumers europe exempt gentlemen transport specifically recorded rules laid directive directive states diesel tax 33 cents per litre fixed one variable today several parliamentary groups confused yet spanish government set 38 cents per litre 're always papists pope always go one step ahead expressing users diesel already tell must rich must indeed wealthy question spain needs tighten belt give dates 2003 directive adopted spain 's external debt eur 400 billion say directive approves new tax rates new revenues spanish accounts probably healthier since contrary debt today eur 1 400 billion i.e. debt multiplied three three despite additional revenue problem disguised doctors economics come teach us lessons gives us lessons socialist party shall speak gives us lessons bildu bildu terrorists arnaldo otegi david pla last military leader eta directive terrorists parliamentary group eta congress come dare give economic lessons dare talk taxes revolutionary taxes must know socialist party comes tells us going get money socialists true manifest expert squandering public money spent eur 680 million andalusian unemployed single corruption case get money lower taxes

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,"Thank you very much Madam President Today the VOX Parliamentary Group launches an urgent appeal to the Government to the Minister of Transport in particular and the question is quite simple we want to know what you are going to do it seems that the Minister has no interest in the transport sector to solve the transport crisis in Spain the transport crisis The first question to be introduced is who the carriers are In Spain there are around 200,000 trucks providing public freight services Of these 200 000 trucks 45 to 50 are operated by self employed persons yes by self employed persons While the government your government minister locked up all the Spaniards during the VID illegally by the way as the Constitutional Court has declared these autonomous these transporters continued to function and allowed all our supermarkets and all our pantry to be full complete and we had food while you had locked us up Those are the transporters these are them And it is important to underline it because at that time you applauded them They applauded them but then came the crisis of the Brexit the passage through the Channel Tunnel and there our truckers were stuck they were stuck by a diplomatic negligence of their Government precisely And his government to those whom he had previously applauded left them at the stake abandoned in the tunnel of the channel of La Mancha Then a few months later the drunken Filomena arrived and again the negligence of his government caught Spain with low guard Spain took the risk and glimpsed the risk of food shortages There we have seen a first warning of what can happen if there is indeed a shortage Well those truckers those transporters again as heroes fought for Spain and in the worst weather conditions allowed our refrigerators and pantry to remain full And you again stood idly by They 're the ones who gave the bosom do And those truckers those more than 100,000 self employed 200,000 trucks suffer serious problems that do not come from today are problems that come from far away and that have added to that cocktail machine that today we are seeing both the Socialist Party and the People 's Party because do not forget the problem of transport comes from far away And he spoke of the question of security on roads and at rest points a question due precisely to the insecurity of the citizen and the lack of funding of our forces and state security forces that both the People 's Party and the Socialist Party have been feeding for years I am talking about the logistics platforms that operate in Spain by somehow taking away this profit margin from our trucks logistic platforms that actually come from third countries from abroad in those countries operate with tax rules with social norms different from those of Spain and benefit in the end from operating in those regimes and actually billing in Spain And that system has been promoted by both the People 's Party and the Socialist Party I am of course talking about the system of module taxation and cooperatives which again take part of that margin from our carriers and which have also promoted the People 's Party and the Socialist Party that tax system which obliges our transporters Minister to live more of that tax regime than they really do from their work This very specific problem has been brewing for years and you the People 's Party and the Socialist Party have preferred to look away from the problem I hear laughs on the socialist bench it must be that the transport sector causes them hilariousness Sadly the current situation in the VOX Parliamentary Group is only causing sadness and concern Yes do n't protest if you laugh then do n't protest And the crayon of the cake the price of the fuels which have doubled their price in just a few months This issue is also being fraught with from far away because it is an obvious consequence of what its climate policies were of the People 's Party and of the Socialist Party and today we see the consequences of all the problems that you have been avoiding for many years today we see And it is that the transport sector is tired and is not able to resist even one more day because when the costs of the actual transport of a truck are around 1 euro per kilometre the current market prices are around 70 75 cents per kilometre and this is the result of all the problems that I have been listing problems that come from afar that could have been solved one by one and that has not been done Today we find the perfect storm and when the sector goes out to protest in that perfect storm the only excuse that the Minister of Transport and her Government find is that the truckers are fascists that the truckers are from VOX that Putin is very bad and that things are fatal and from there they shrug their shoulders and look back on the other side And in yesterday 's speeches on this issue tangentially representatives came out among others the representative of Podemos a gentleman who comfortably summers in San Sebastián hunts or goes to hunting farms in Burgos and Castile and then comes and tells us looking into our eyes that we have to make an effort for climate change And the problem Minister is that those who are making this effort are precisely our truckers our farmers and all those who are at the dawn of the gift of national sovereignty that the People 's Party and the Socialist Party have made over the years because they come from outside companies and sell agricultural products livestock products at half the price of the Spanish they come from outside companies and provide logistics systems or services at half the price of the Spanish they come from their climate standards and increase the price of fuels which impacts on transport impacts on agriculture impacts on fisheries and impacts on all these sectors And those who suffer the consequences of their energy climate and sovereignty policies are precisely those who work for Spain those who fight every day for Spain those who work during the Filomena storm who are stuck in the Channel Tunnel Those are the shoulders that carry with their climate policies so that then you comfortably sit in your banks quietly in your homes and in your official cars without knowing how much the price of light costs without knowing what the price of fuel is come and tell us with seemingly serious and gloomy that you have to make an effort for climate change when the effort is doing it exactly the ones below And that 's what Minister ca n't continue to happen That is why we tell them that Spain must regain its energy and food sovereignty as soon as possible We must return to the maximum possible degree of control over resources that are essential for the survival

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Thank you very much Madam President Today we are debating a motion for urgent questioning by the Basque Nationalist Party which proposes a set of measures to alleviate the situation in which we are at very high energy prices in Spain And I say conjuncture because it does propose short term measures it does not propose structural measures which are what Spain really needs because the energy situation does not respond only to Putin 's circumstances despite the fact that the PSOE lies go in that direction No it responds to a structural situation in which we are stuck for many years and the problem is that the People 's Party and PSOE as well as the right wing gentlemen have forgotten about the workers on the left wing side They forgot those workers in the field those workers in the industry and in the steel industry and the proof is that without going any further last week they had to stop one of the high furnaces in Sestao without the PNV even changing here because they have forgotten what the real reasons are and what the real impact of the measures they have been taking for many years And it is necessary to include in this cocktail the Veleta party Citizens which says here today expressly that it opposes some of the measures proposed in this initiative because it is not frontal enough opposed to CO2 emissions when that is precisely the nuclear issue that has caused the short term situation in Spain And it is that all the climate measures that the People 's Party and PSOE have been supporting for years have brought us to where we are today and today we are in that energy has multiplied by ten times its price What cost 70 in January last year now costs 700 gas has increased by 800 fuel by 25 copper by 45 and this comes from November nickel by 250 maize by 20 wheat by 26 barley by 21 And all this why Because Community policies relating to energy and food all the planning that has been carried out have failed It has failed because its climate policies have increased energy and production to such an extent that it has been expelled from Spain Europe and our environment and we have launched it to third countries on which we now rely exclusively So now bringing barley costs us more bringing wheat costs us more because it is no longer profitable to grow it and produce it here That 's why we have to import aluminum that 's why energy is at these deorbited prices that 's why our carriers suffer that 's why our cattle farmers suffer and that 's why the high furnace of Sestao lords of the PNV has had to close that 's why And you of this nuclear and essential question that has caused the structural situation in which we are not saying a single word because you have forgotten the left margin because you no longer understand what the real needs of the workers are and you do not understand that if we really want to take care of our environment and our environment we need to maintain and preserve Europe 's industry agriculture livestock and transport It is necessary and urgent that we take concrete action on this you do not mention it and Citizens specifically attack it In short what makes no sense is that here in Europe and in Spain in particular we are killing our industry and our transport agriculture and so on when Germany emits about 8 tonnes of CO2 per capita per year or China which is the monster of CO2 emits about 9 or 10 tonnes of CO2 per capita per year You see it 's not that different Spain today is broadcasting around 4 We have sacrificed ourselves we have cut off the feet and hands of our farmers of our industry of our carriers to give it up to third parties who continue to pollute and who continue with the CO2 emission policies that we have renounced and for this we have renounced our industry We must take reasonable measures and not the unreasonable measures proposed here The short term measures are not enough we must take structural measures so please take them

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Thank you very much and good afternoon We have talked a great deal about what we have been talking about in the afternoon and in this speech on this issue In particular several spokesmen from all political groups have spoken about the cost of light and have said no the cost of light for many reasons Well gentlemen of the government gentlemen of the People 's Party gentlemen of Podemos open your eyes and tell your voters the truth the price of light is so high for their climate policies for all those impositions that come from the European Commission and to which you support for the closure of the thermal power plants in Asturias for the closure of the coal mines For all these questions the price of light is so high and not for various questions in abstract You 're still talking about the very high electrical expenditure Mrs Mallada from the PP talks about electrical spending Mrs Mallada if you want to attack and curb electricity expenditure you directly attack all these issues and all these policies and do not launch or support these smoke bombs that the Socialist Party is launching In particular the spokesman for Podemos Asturian by the way demonstrates an absolute lack of knowledge of how this energy and industrial issue works It says some industries that due to the high cost of energy their expenditure on electricity accounts for more than 50 This is not the case these industries spend more than 50 on electricity because it is one of the main assets they employ for their production system not because prices are currently very high This is because they sometimes exceed 60 70 or 75 of the cost which should not be but 50 is already normal Moreover this is what the sector demanded was the requirement to be recognized as electro intensive an issue that all parties here today have completely ignored You have also spoken of a hard conversion Well it has been hard for some for the whole mining sector for the mining basins and for the industry because the trade unionists to which by the way Mrs Castañón quotes as pops of the mining conversion have not had a hard conversion on the contrary these gentlemen have lined up with the mining conversion The proof is that every day we come up with condemnations of trade unionists from one or another of the main trade unions among others the most famous how not Mr. Villa Mrs. Lastra 's political godfather sitting here looking down You talk about that resilient Asturias you talk about that Asturias that has tractor force you talk about that Asturias that had illusion Well I did because you guys stole it Here the question is that the council of Laviana for example has today fewer inhabitants than in 1950 Mieres the cradle of the Asturian industry has fewer inhabitants than in 1920 Avilés is below the population level he had in 1970 The Council of Aller which in 1970 had a proud population of 28 000 today has barely 10 000 Cangas del Narcea which in 1970 had 20 000 very worthy inhabitants today it is hardly 12 000 And this has been caused by your policies your policies because if it is very ugly to deceive all the Spaniards which is what you constantly do it is even more ugly to deceive your own voters Because all those workers industrialists miners who with illusion voted to them believing that they were going to solve even some of their problems did not know that you were actually the wolf dressed as lamb and that what they did was to close one by one all the ways of earning bread and sustenance but not from them but also from their children and grandchildren And that 's what happens today that in Asturias there are fewer and fewer children left fewer grandchildren left to guarantee that future and this is the key to everything Because the government of Asturias of the Socialist Party and of Podemos Socialist Party that has ruled this ruinous Asturias for forty years is dedicated to throwing smoke bombs and distractions so that the voters their voters instead of looking at those nuclear issues which are really the germ of the destruction of Asturias look at these fireworks that you launch Here we have Mr. Barbon how he launches his bable language campaign supported of course by Podemos By the way the spokesman for Podemos on the Board of the Principality is a Lord of Huesca who supports the supposedly Asturian language You guys keep talking about the COVID They impose restrictions on fundamental rights for citizens to be forced to talk and to worry about these issues rather than thinking about these elements that undermine their future and that of their children and grandchildren And now you are launching this particular initiative which is just another smoke bomb to disguise yourself as nuns and speak with a sanctifying voice as if it were you Socialist Party and Podemos supported by the PP to save the electrointensive industry with an initiative that in just one folio provides absolutely no solution And it does not provide any solution because the Statute for Electro Intensives which was already adopted one year before this initiative was approved in the Asturian Parliament establishes a very concrete barrier for an industry to be considered electro intensive it consumes 1.5 kilowatts per euro of gross value added Many of you will not even understand what this figure represents of course because the explanatory statements and all the issues that the sector has brought have probably not even been read This barrier is the one that establishes the status of the electro intensive and it is exactly the same one that establishes this initiative that brings us all here today by the hand The sector has already said that it is an initiative that is useless it has already said that this barrier that you establish only serves to multiply those industries that can opt for electro intensive compensation funds diluting therefore the amount that will be distributed among all of them And in the end what happens That those industries which as Mrs Castañón has misunderstood consume more than 50 of their energy resources they need to produce will not receive the necessary compensation Talking about compensation is fine especially in this situation but it would be much better to talk about it in another way to think about why electricity is so expensive in Spain why when the price of basic electricity in Germany comes out at 200 euros now that it is in the clouds in Spain it comes out at around 320 euros Why For your climate policies because you have been the adalids of climate policies It was not enough for them to adopt the European Commission 's approach you had to improve it and that is what is sinking the future of workers and industry in

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Madam Minister the truth is that you are coming and telling us that the escalation of people in energy poverty is simply because they are now studying Your answer is absolutely surreal The reality is that since 2018 when you came to the government the number of people at risk of energy poverty has only grown It is clear that this situation is solely due to the energy policy that you are implementing because all the substantive measures that you are carrying out produce an escalation in the costs of energy both of transport fuels and of electricity and the only measures you take to prevent this are subsidies You 're talking about the fuel subsidy perfect It is temporary Minister it is not a structural measure which is what Spain needs You are talking about the Iberian exception which again is a subsidy that will be paid through taxes by all Spaniards When you talk about savings it 's not savings it 's deferred payment It 's like you get to the restaurant and leave the bill to duty That 's exactly what your ministry is doing So you are implementing policies that increase the prices of energy products and all you do is subsidize to camouflage these shooting costs and of course limit the reputational and voting impact which is all you are interested in The doubt that arises here is who you rule for For those corrupt socialists bribed by Morocco or by Qatar Sure power suppliers In addition you to Morocco then guarantees contracts to plant olive trees and make direct competition to Spain You buy dirty energy from Morocco In short you do not rule for the Spanish You do n't rule for the Spaniards Its measures are detrimental to all Spaniards So I beg you ask Ask,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,45.53499,-3.2745388,34,madam minister truth coming telling us escalation people energy poverty simply studying answer absolutely surreal reality since 2018 came government number people risk energy poverty grown clear situation solely due energy policy implementing substantive measures carrying produce escalation costs energy transport fuels electricity measures take prevent subsidies 're talking fuel subsidy perfect temporary minister structural measure spain needs talking iberian exception subsidy paid taxes spaniards talk savings 's savings 's deferred payment 's like get restaurant leave bill duty 's exactly ministry implementing policies increase prices energy products subsidize camouflage shooting costs course limit reputational voting impact interested doubt arises rule corrupt socialists bribed morocco qatar sure power suppliers addition morocco guarantees contracts plant olive trees make direct competition spain buy dirty energy morocco short rule spanish n't rule spaniards measures detrimental spaniards beg ask ask
#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Thank you so much I have to point out to the spokesman for Podemos He cited VOX 's initiatives in Castile and León but sent him a correction VOX has not proposed reopening a closed power plant on the contrary VOX is studying the construction of two power plants where there was one before So it 's possible that the actual VOX proposal likes you a lot less What VOX is proposing is that two new cycle modular nuclear power plants be built in the former Garoña site which would effectively complement or at least partially alleviate the energy disaster that its Government is causing in Spain Today we come here to discuss an initiative proposed by the People 's Party in which it proposes above all two measures For everyone who listens to us to understand it quickly the first of these measures is to allow consumers with an irregular intensity in the consumption of electric energy to take two contracts so that the months in which they consume a high intensity of electric power choose one of them and in the months in which they consume less choose this second contract In this way they would reduce their bill be more efficient and better adapt their consumption to the bill The second measure is to create new time zones according to the time of the year so that restaurants regalant communities etc. can again adapt their consumption and make their bill more efficient according to the time zones The measures are positive of course The spirit of the rule supporting the tourism sector and supporting the Spanish agricultural sector is positive and we will therefore support it However the measure is totally inadequate Moreover some of the criticisms that have been made so far to the People 's Party are absolutely opportune because the energy disaster in which Spain finds itself is of course the fault of the Ministry of Ecological Transition of our fanatical minister Teresa Ribera but it is also the fault of the previous governments of the People 's Party And let 's explain it very quickly Both governments or both parties in their successive governments have embraced the postulates of the 2030 Agenda Again so that those who listen to us understand it and do not let themselves be confused or deceived for example by the spokesman of Compromís who comes here and shouts in a very unpleasant tone the Agenda 2030 embraced by the People 's Party And by the Socialist Party it is the one that has reduced the generation of nuclear energy and the one that has reduced and eliminated the thermal power plants of Spain moreover the Socialist Party has physically dynamized several of them It is they who tax the diesel and are ultimately the ones who have put all the eggs in the same basket a basket called gas a basket that today pays the highest prices in history That is why Spain is paying the highest energy cost in history VOX proposes that we forget that 2030 Agenda and regain common sense We diversify our options we divide among all the energy sources we have available such as nuclear energy which is much cheaper Let us think that if today the megawatt hour of gas costs us in Spain 400 euros in Germany 1000 by the way the megawatt hour of nuclear energy costs us 60 euros That is what the Lords of Podemos hide from our farmers our tourism sector and the whole industry in Spain that the policy of the 2030 Agenda is the one that causes these so high energy prices And that is precisely what does not attack this initiative of the People 's Group So that you and all the Spaniards understand what measures we are proposing we ask the Government and the Lords of Podemos who are so sure of their measures in our opinion suicidal to consult the Spaniards farmers farmers of Spain do you want to pay those bills four or five times as much as they were paying two years ago Or do you want to pay a reasonable bill for the energy you consume and need to produce the services Look at us look at us Launch a public consultation article 92 of the Constitution provides for this Ask the Spaniards if they prefer their Suicidal Agenda 2030 contrary to the interests of the Spaniards contrary to the Spanish families and contrary to the Spanish countryside or if they prefer to use themselves as far as possible and use all available energy sources And yes when we are 100 green and we can consume 100 wind or 100 solar energy let 's do it but until that day comes please diversify our risks This is the question you must ask the Spaniards and this is the voice that you pampers and socialists steal from the Spaniards For this reason VOX makes a very simple proposal please return the word to the Spanish so that families farmers and industry can speak Thank you so

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Madam Minister for Ecological Transition today I ask you what concrete measures the Government is going to take to ensure that Spain 's Energy Plan benefits the Spaniards The question is quite specific and for this I am going to develop a series of ideas at the same time as the proposals that we have been putting forward some of which by the way have already welcomed you which is very commendable and it would be very good if you welcomed all of them The energy reality in Spain today is devastating because families and companies are suffering a very serious situation which not only affects these direct energy costs but also increases the prices of all products both those that are transported by road and those that are produced by consuming electricity And that is one of the reasons that pushes prices up and down the quality of life and ability and purchasing power of the Spaniards The easiest and easiest example is that the typical daily menu and breakfast cafeteria which previously paid about 700 euros of energy now pays around 1500 has almost doubled its cost And this is the basic cost of direct energy consumption alone but also the products have almost doubled their prices due to the cost of labour thanks to their companion Yolanda Díaz through social contributions In short all the costs of the Spanish production system are increasing and that is by the way one of the issues that push upwards the inflation that is so much being talked about The reasons for this energy rise which are complex and many come almost exclusively from its energy plan A country 's energy plan is a fundamental part of this country 's strategy think that today everything consumes energy The first point of an energy plan is to clarify what its objective is The aim of Spain 's Energy Plan should be the well being of the Spanish and yet you have left it out You only have the 2030 Agenda as your goal Those who listen to us will be asked why we are repeating the question of the 2030 Agenda so much The 2030 Agenda is precisely one of the reasons why energy is in today 's prices The leitmotiv of the agenda very repeated by you Minister and by your entire government is the very famous decarbonisation But Spain has already made a huge effort on this issue the households in Spain are the least energy consuming in Europe I give you the data 0.3 tons of oil equivalent it is a somewhat complex unit is what a Spanish household consumes However the EU average is 0.5 and Germany is 0.7 We are one of the most efficient in Europe But we are too in CO2 because Spain emits 0.33 tons of CO2 for every megawatt hour produced in 2000 and today we emit 0.14 that is we have doubled our efficiency in energy generation and you even tighten the nuts more In addition the Spanish also emit less CO2 than the rest of the Europeans since Spain is around 4 tons of CO2 per inhabitant while Germany emits around 7 and the EU average is around 6 and you ask the Spanish to make even more efforts That 's why we think you should ask the Spaniards Launch a public consultation use Article 92 of the Constitution and ask them Do you want Agenda 2030 electricity bills of 1500 euros diesel to 1.9 euros or do you want freedom sovereignty and Agenda Spain well being for the Spaniards Ask him openly because you Minister are taking all these measures behind the back of the Spaniards This question has not been consulted or included in your programme nor has it been openly announced because you are hiding under slogans the real and harmful consequences for the Spaniards When asked by the way why these prices the price of the price you respond with some clichés the war the virus and Franco on this occasion you have not used it But the question is when do they start to raise prices In the year 2020 minister when there was no war and the virus had passed recovery according to you on uve The other excuse you give is to point out to the electrical companies but it is also not understandable that this is the reason when you have them tied and well tied since countless positions of the Socialist Party control the electrics today through their boards of directors We have Mr Carmona Mrs Salgado Mr Pepiño Blanco Mr Montilla Mrs Corredor Mr Serra etc You already control the electrics Moreover Minister through the CNMC and now CNMV Mr Bacigalupo also had control over the performance of electricity companies If you considered that you were carrying out some kind of bad practice you could have intervened so much so that you have your hands stuck in them to the elbows but only for the good to use them as slogans to hide behind them and use them as excuses The real reason for this is obvious its strategy is wrong That is why Spain is worse than all the others in our environment despite being the most efficient in our environment as I have already enumerated with data The solutions we bring you are relatively simple Minister and we have been announcing them for a very long time Agenda Spain item 13 presented in October 2021 This includes tax cuts which by the way have welcomed you the recovery of energy sovereignty an essential element we must be able to take advantage of the resources we have Minister many or few but we must be able to take advantage of them because something will help or the nuclear issue which you have set in your sights you and all the previous governments by the way This issue of nuclear power has been discussed a great deal saying that it is in the long term We remind you that the central of Garoña which the People 's Party promised to save in 2009 ceased its activities in 2011 already with the People 's Party in government and closed definitively in 2017 with the People 's Party in government Now we have the Almaraz power station whose license to act expires in 2027 there are five years left It seems a lot but between licence renewal applications and fuel applications that time frame is exactly what it takes five years If you delay extending the business permit of this plant you will no longer be able to continue in operation and will necessarily have to be closed You keep closing and demolishing the thermals In Asturias they have already dismantled the Lada plant and have authorized the dismantling of the Soto de la Barca thermal plant In the end Spain produces less and less energy when we need more and more Of course you also talk about an issue that is very related because your leitmotiv is the climate If what they want to defend is the climate defend our waters promote the interconnection of the basins let us take advantage of our water resources Today precisely don Pedro Sánchez quotes without shame the desertification of Spain when it is you who are authorizing and allowing the emptying of all the reservoirs and dams that we have in Spain when in reality we could take advantage of them and channel them directly between the watersheds and employ between 1 and 2.5 million hectares that today are empty in water A simple and easy plan that would defend the climate that would help that decarbonisation that you preach so much and that would serve the interests of the Spaniards not those of your 2030 Agenda of course but those of the Spaniards That is why we ask you to focus on Spain We ask you to accept all those proposals that we have been launching for you both in the Agenda Spain and in the motion of censure that was raised last year where you have a concrete detailed programme that could take advantage of reuse Use We 've put it at your disposal Of course there is the tax reduction on the bill for light which we already proposed to you in April last year and which we thank you for having welcomed But the key Minister is that they separate the 2030 Agenda from their energy plan and put the Spaniards in the center If you have any doubts about whether or not this is what the Spaniards want and need I invite you to consult them The Constitution provides for it allows it and that is what we must do Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,45.348812,-3.492061,34,madam minister ecological transition

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Thank you very much Madam President Minister you bring us a real decree law that you have already put a lot of qualifications throughout today but the truth is that you mix it in it which is a rule that by definition is approved for the extraordinary and urgent need of the issues that it addresses matters so varied that go from self consumption to the remuneration of agricultural workers and the requirements of the peonadas to then be able to charge that so called PER passing through the specific regulation of the City of Energy Foundation one of those bars of the Ministry of Ecological Transition through which you channel grants above all for your friends the social bonus a specific regulation for consumers of natural gas and electricity and an adaptation for the system of injection of renewable gases to the system of gas channeling of Spain In short you mix a number of subjects that each of them would require specific regulation and specific legislative processing These are matters so very relevant to Spain and to the Spaniards that they do not deserve a dip like the one you bring us here today Moreover with each of these distinct and heterogeneous points that you address in this royal decree law what you do is to introduce small patches into a system that obviously does n't work because minister you can't pretend to cover the holes in the system with tirites that as a casket you are introducing Madam Minister you have to change the Spanish energy system from A to Z because as Mr de Podemos says for them to make it all public even if Spain had seventeen public energy companies the price of electricity and gas would remain exactly the same for two reasons first the marginalist pricing system and secondly the CO2 emission allowances which ultimately act as an undercover tax and which tax the Spanish in all their activities because these taxes are paid from oil to energy generation or industrial production All the products consumed by the Spanish at the end are burdened by their energy policy and it is precisely that energy policy that does not work You can introduce endless point subsidies here or there help this sector or this other but if you do n't change the whole system we will never achieve in Spain a reliable cost effective and affordable electricity and energy system for all Spaniards Going further to the question these little patches you 're introducing all they do is add a terrible complexity to this system The proof is that of the social bonus of which you now extend its amount only 45 of potential applicants have been able to fill out the forms to opt for that fund How can this be Minister How can it be Why do n't you attack those intrinsic deficiencies that our energy system has and stop imposing patches one by one The reality is that you continue to be obsessed with your ideological imposition You are committed to making us commulgate with mill wheels when the situation in Spain does not allow it Madam Minister I beg you to listen to me and attend to me It does n't really seem like it As I said you Minister created an energy system that did not foresee an alternative if a crisis such as the one that comes with the rise in gas prices one for the war in Ukraine and two for bad diplomatic relations with Algeria You got rid of the spare wheels of that car in which we circulate all the Spaniards and now which has happened the emergency and we have had the puncture you shrug your shoulders and say Wow for God 's sake we do n't have an emergency system And what you propose to us is that we continue to move forward with the folded wheel suffering that situation the Spaniards That 's exactly what they 're doing Madam Minister we have to go back to a reasonable system a system in which the energy mix does not make us depend on one or two energy systems exclusively We need to go back to a system in which hydrocarbons are not as severely penalised as they are today Minister with the litre of 2 euros in diesel Spain cannot work 90 of the goods circulating in Spain are moving by road and that form of transport will not change in the short term no matter how hard you are So Minister I repeat the question I asked you the other day why do you not consult the Spanish instead of imposing your dogmas Why not ask them and let Spain decide whether it wants its system expensive inefficient and harmful to Spain 's interests or whether on the contrary the Spaniards prefer to depend on their energies exploit the energy resources that we have in Spain many or few Why not ask them whether they prefer Greta Thunberg or whether they prefer a reasonable sustainable and efficient energy system Madam Minister please let Spain decide Thank you so

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,"Thank you so much Madam Minister in this urgent inquiry I am asking you a question that is relatively simple what changes are you going to make in your energy policy so that it serves the real interest of the Spanish people What changes Because today the policy that you are carrying out does not serve the interests of the Spaniards Perhaps it serves the interests of some lobbies that you seem to be benefiting from perhaps it serves the interests of a dogmatic ideology that you defend but of course it does not serve the interests of the Spanish In the previous urgent inquiry addressed to you you have given quite a bit of information that frankly puts the hair at the top You say Welcome to this debate Madam Minister what debate if you do not allow us to debate You come here fencing your dogmas because you are authentic dogmas of faith Madam Minister you even if you look down and bend your head never allow us to discuss your ideological principles And from them you force us as if forced feeding is about to swallow all your policies to the detriment of the Spaniards As you have been speaking among your ideas you have said we have looked for new solutions but problems have arisen that we could not have foreseen Your whole policy Minister reminds me very much of Mao's Great Jump Forward when Mao found a solution to those sparrows who ate the wheat he threw a plague of locusts The locusts wiped out the sparrows but they also caused a famine that caused millions of deaths in China The Communist Government was defending itself by saying We found a solution but there was a problem that we had not foreseen You with your ideological dogmas are generating the Spanish the biggest energy problem in their history I 'll give you some data The IDAE a small shop of its ministry watered with 195 million euros public by the way whose director a propagandist at his service charges about 100,000 euros a year for spreading the word of the ministry says that the expected prices of electricity for today in Europe will be for Spain the highest in all Europe Where 's your solution Minister You who came dressed as saviors with your policies Iberian mechanism all the stories you advertise day after day How can we pay almost twice as much in Spain as in Germany for electricity How can that Germany that has reopened its coal plants pay half of what Spain pays Simply Madam Minister because they are functioning at a stroke of science they are functioning at a stroke of numbers not like you who are functioning at a stroke of ideology And when you are discussed you replicate with your dogmas quite simple but some fall into the population You say electrical storage Minister electrical storage is not available today on a large scale The proof is that the energy can only be stored in the swamps which you by the way are allowing to empty because every time and this the Spaniards have to understand that a dam opens its gates has had to collect prior permission from the corresponding hydrographic confederation that is from you So if the swamps in Spain are empty they are emptied and we lose those cubic meters of water is because you have authorized it Please explain to me how this can be done for the benefit of the Spaniards You criticise that we are talking about coal but it is that minister when the electricity generated by coal thermal power plants entered the energy mix they brought down the price because in that Machiavellian system that you designed the last energy to enter it is the one that sets the price and the coal which entered the last one by law had a lower price than the gas That is you have tied your rope to our necks and you are the ones pulling precisely from that rope that today stifles the Spaniards which forces you to pay the bill for the most expensive light in history By the way where are your unions Where are those little pomegranates who in 2017 were screaming against a 70 euros bill of light when we are now paying 126 megawatt hours How can it be Minister that when you come we are criticized for saying renewable energies yes but to the right extent They cannot pretend to replace all of Spain 's energy today with renewable energy it is physically impossible The proof of this is that of renewable energy in Spain wind power has an efficiency of around 25 that is of all the power installed in Spain in each hour it is operating approximately 25 the remaining 75 of average is stopped And the solar much less And this Minister you will not be able to change by decree law It 's a physical reality they wo n't be able to overcome In addition to that there are other discussions and it is that the photovoltaic plates that are installed in Spain come entirely from China which basically subject us to the same energy dependence as any other energy import I 'm going on with the argument Aerogenerators blades are not recyclable or reusable When the useful life that they have lasts about twenty years these quotes pile on uncamped on top of each other some try to bury themselves Where 's that ecology you 're defending Where 's that green energy you 're defending Because in the end reality is neither white nor black as you want to represent it reality moves on a gray scale and what Spain needs is a useful energy mix that draws or depends on the resources we have in Spain be it gas be it coal be it oil as far as possible Minister Because if we have coal production when international production suddenly goes off we can control prices using our production Even if we used hydraulic gas fracture extraction we could control gas prices at that time when they are internationally fired which is what the United States does by the way I keep telling you Minister that although plagues throughout Spain with renewable energy plants would not be able to meet all the demand in Spain And even worse this energy also has an impact The mountains of Tineo in Asturias I do n't know if you know them are currently plagued by aerogenerators The agricultural work that was carried out in those mountains can no longer be done That has an impact on our industry on our agri -food sector which you are sacrificing for your religion Like those who made human sacrifices on the altars for their religion you sacrifice industrial sectors of Spain for your religion Moreover the marine wind turbines that have been installed have proved to make the fishing activity in its surroundings totally incompatible Again an industrial sector that of artisanal fishing which by the way for you should be eco friendly fully defendable that you are sacrificing for your religion In short it 's not all as green as you paint it We must once again defend that Spain depends to the extent possible on its own resources Besides minister I think that 's what the Spaniards want The Spaniards are not willing to pay the record bills for you to put an Agenda 2030 medallion on your chest they are not The Spanish want to ensure the interests of the Spanish always within reason but they want to be able to survive And the proof that in the background you also care about the opinion of the Spaniards is that their Correspondent of Podemos the other day was plotting here in Congress a circular graph according to which the very large majority of Spaniards have a kind of anxiety or climate anxiety which in theory would support their dogmatic policy Well Minister if you 're really interested in the opinion of the Spanish why do n't you ask them Why do they not open a public consultation supported by article 92 of the Constitution on essential political and economic issues of the nation which is by the way what the Constitution says Why do n't you open that consultation with all the guarantees Ask the Spaniards if they want Greta or if they want to depend on themselves if they want their climate insanities with unobstructed electricity prices or if on the contrary they want to live in a state with reasonable certainty Why do n't you ask Why Open that consultation Or go up here and explain to the Spaniards looking them in the eye why do n't they want to ask them I suspect that it is because you know that the Spaniards are reasonable and want a reasonable policy not the dogmatic policy that you propose And if not go and ask the neighbors of La Robla the neighbors of Langreo or the neighbors of Soto de la Barca in León and Asturias thermal plants opened in the forties sixties and seventies which today have the most expensive energy in history and

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Minister your policy is so disastrous that it jumps to the alarms of the Congress of Deputies In your dogma minister as good heirs of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party you come with the lesson learned you have not stopped repeating I think up to seventeen times I have counted a Spanish card You repeat as a parrot the four ideas that draw you from the ministry The reality is that you are absolutely out of the world Minister I did n't say we had to grab the coal I did n't say You come twist the words and try to bring the arguments closer to your convenience Minister Spain and the Spanish need a prudent prudent energy mix Now we are faced with a situation that you described very well when you said that we depend on a single gas supplier that is Putin you are absolutely right and that is the policy of the European Commission and its successive governments in Spain That 's really the problem We cannot depend on a single supplier We need to diversify our energy sources as much as possible Spain has gas reserves to supply for forty three years and you in your ecological transition law even forbids exploring them So do n't come here and tell us Chinese stories because you are actually Chinese that you want us to have energy independence of any kind because the technology with which photovoltaic energy is generated comes from China energy dependence and the systems with which electric energy is generated by aerogeneration also have their ecological glues But you prefer to erase them because you dogmatically cling only to those two possible sources of energy The reality is that Spain and the Spaniards go on a boat all together and you for some lofty but dogmatic idea convinced us to burn or throw into the water all the lifeboats and suddenly something that was not in your schemes has caused that boat to sink What 's the surprise That Spain has no lifeboats because you carried out an energy policy for years absolutely irresponsible We must Madam Minister return to common sense we must Madam Minister rely on as many sources as possible that is diversification And if those sources can be extracted in Spain let 's do it but do n't close yourselves in the band for as I said mere ideology You 're talking about agriculture Madam Minister you in the CAP have established the obligation to receive European funds to put land on a beard They 've taken us to medieval farming techniques And you intend to tell us that we are old At the very least your Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge is medieval and that Minister runs counter to the interests of the Spanish You 're talking about swamps being in historical minima Madam Minister because you have authorized each and every one of the empty ones that have been produced all of them and this is important for the Spanish to understand and for you to stop lying to the Spanish Therefore please Minister prepare in accordance with Article 92 of the Constitution a public consultation on whether the Spaniards want their strategy harmful to the interests of Spain or whether on the contrary they prefer a reasonable strategy Renewable Yes but to the right extent and with patience because as much as you tighten the accelerator to the renewables what is going to happen is that the Spaniards are choking because we do not have the capacity today to assume the strategy that you intend to impose on us Please ask and let Spain decide whether it wants its climate crazy or wants common sense reasonable energy prices energy available to all Spaniards and energy that depends on ourselves Ask the Spaniards Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,44.75632,-2.251189,34,minister policy disastrous jumps alarms congress deputies

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Thank you so much Very good afternoon now I will intervene a little quickly because we have many issues to deal with that are relatively complex We are talking about the validation of a real decree law presented to us by the Minister of Ecological Transition which is a complex decree of those who mix barbecues with merinas as always does the Socialist Party they make a very complex cocktail with measures ranging from an extension of the deadlines to request an exemption in the obligation to pay certain commissions and financial interests they give an extension by the way because the system created by the Socialist Party is so highly complex and bureaucratic that not even 2 of potential applicants have been able to fill out the forms that is they give an extension for their own cogeneration to the question of cogeneration It is important that we all understand what cogeneration is a technology that generates heat and with that heat that it produces it also generates electrical energy It is very good for those industries that need heat such as the paper industry or the ceramic industry They put in a cogeneration plant they produce their heat they also produce electrical energy that they convert to the system and sell it in a very concrete regulated system and so they pay for a part of that heat that they need It is a very efficient system and works very well but it has a problem that the Socialist Party invents a mechanism to subsidize gas and excludes cogeneration plants What 's wrong with this It 's priceless What happens when they 're out of price They have to shut down the cogeneration plant The minister in an absolutely incomprehensible speech in which of course mixes concepts of one type and another does not tell us that when a cogeneration plant closes it closes the industry to which this plant feeds Thus it has happened that this summer they have gone to Castellónquinientos and peak workers to the street because of your fault minister In Asturias they are depending on a thread in the area of Navia two hundred and peak jobs because of your fault minister In Pontevedra there 's a trash can that 's about to close Finally they put cogeneration into this royal decree and also put a VAT rebate on the gas bill but as a previous spokesman has said they do not put a rebate on the butane candy which is the most basic good of these gas related products They do not include it that must be rich and there the VAT is not reduced The reduction in VAT brought to us by the Government is a real insult because it proposes a reduction in VAT for October November and December Is it not going to be cold on January 1st On 1 January there is no longer a problem that is the VAT reduction is until 31 December and from 31 December everything is perfect And it is that we find that the Government is covering its cods with new cods with new cods and with new cods Always with temporary resolutions and small patches instead of attacking the substantial issue instead of solving the problem What 's the problem The problem Minister is that you and the previous governments have thrown us into a suicidal energy policy for thirty years We 've put all the eggs in one basket and now all of a sudden that basket is broken That basket is gas and renewables Mr. De Podemos postin ecologist denies with his head Now I 'll explain to you what Podemos proposes Madam Minister we have thrown ourselves into an energy race in which we have made ourselves dependent on one product What happens now That this product weakens and therefore Spain enters into crisis What does VOX propose For VOX proposes energy sovereignty which in all we can Minister we depend on ourselves From ourselves much or little but if we can take a little advantage of the energy we have here let 's take advantage of it And the Lord of Podemos comes and tells us his battles and his films and says renewable only renewable and nothing but renewable and the gas is fatal And it shows me a survey Who answered that survey He says that ninety six percent of young Spaniards What young Spaniards Who answered that The slums that chase you around all day Who voted that Greta Thunberg whining Mehan stole childhood Greta Thunberg who has lived a systematic life of luxury These people vote for those issues Who voted that Those young girls who said chickens were being raped by cocks Those are the ones who voted for Podemos 's crazy poll Yes yes it teaches me a cheese rosita by the way of the color of Podemos The reality gentlemen is that Spain has embarked on a crazy career in its energy strategy You speak gentlemen of Podemos of renewable energy which is very good but it is that for all of us to understand each other Spain has an installed wind power of around 30 gigas and in the last year there have been six Spain has a solar power of around 20 gigas and in the last year there have been an average of 4 Why Because the sun does n't shine twenty four hours a day and the wind does n't blow twenty four hours a day What happens when the wind does n't blow and the sun does n't shine That we need what is called a back up energy and thank you or because of you the only back up energy that Spain has today is gas Because of him We used to have coal we had a good nuclear plant and we had hydraulic power which you do n't like either In short we had many cards in our deck we could play according to which one had a better or a worse price but because of their strategies Socialist Party and We Can we are totally sold That is why if a community of standard owners of Spain which by the way are outside their gas mechanisms that is the Spanish families the Spanish little one on foot are outside their gas subsidy mechanisms which only apply to the industry which is not bad but apply it to everyone it was paying about 200 euros per floor of community cost it has now been put at around 400 euros The cost to families has almost doubled for energy and I am talking about the typical standard community in Madrid that has a heating agas heating that by the way was previously coal and you forced to change the gas putting them in front of this sword of Damocles that is now going to cut off their heads In short like so many times the government places a hook a trap for the Spaniards and puts a small bait on it Minister stop cheating on Spain and please take the necessary steps to resolve this crisis Get us out of the marginalist market just like they 're going to get Spain out of the Energy Charter Convention Thank you

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Thank you very much Mr President The Group of the European People 's Party is bringing us an initiative that announces seemingly sharp support for Spanish industry and a very important part of this initiative does have an acceptable content we could say that 75 of the initiative but another 25 is totally unacceptable and I will explain This 25 which is a full section of the initiative is entitled Protocol for the decarbonisation with capitalization of the de of the Spanish industry And we must start by asking ourselves if we like industry if we want Spain to have a strong industry it is important that we all ask ourselves because although it seems like a pergrullada the answer in both parties of the alternation is probably not or at least not so much and I will explain myself The climate issue and energy are closely related as everyone knows Indeed energy is one of the industry 's main inputs as well as having a strong impact on the climate issue as the industry emits the so called CO2 and I explain myself CO2 costs are an administrative cost To get an idea from those who listen to us a steel producing steel company in Spain will sell every tonne of steel about 700 euros and will have to pay for its CO2 emissions up to about 132 euros Do you guys realize that They represent approximately 15 of the final product price of CO2 emissions regardless of the costs of CO2 included in energy production We 're still talking about gasoline diesel and so on The State imposes taxes representing 50 of the final price of petrol and diesel If there is now petrol at 2 euros one euro is taken directly by the Administration between VAT excise duties excise duties on the value added of the product etc And yet they attack these forms of energy and beat other potential forms of energy that we could have in Spain Think about fracking oil in the Canary Islands nuclear energy etc And why do they do it Because they do n't like the industry so much The reality is that all they are doing is putting the industry one after the other and the most obvious example we have in regulating CO2 emissions to car production The European Union drew up a first regulation in 2007 In 2009 they tighten and demand fewer emissions punish them more another regulation In 2011 another in 2015 another in 2017 another And in 2021 with the approval of the Fit for 55 plan they ended up giving the industry the blow of grace All this within these protocols for the decarbonisation of industry that the People 's Party introduces in this initiative which supposedly seeks to support industry You 'll think should CO2 emissions be moderated Of course we must be moderated of course but what makes no sense is what they are doing in the alternation of parties because they have both done so whenever they have ruled You see that from 2007 to 2021 both have ruled and both have been accentuating the demands for our industry and the situation is that the industry is disappearing in Spain You yourselves gentlemen of the People 's Party introduce measures that wear it down and attack it in initiatives that you supposedly intend to support because you have abandoned the workers Both are traitors they have abandoned the workers they have abandoned the industry and they have abandoned the sector The proof is that all milk production in Spain is disappearing precisely because of energy costs Fisheries in Spain are in danger of extinction precisely or among other things of energy costs Let us not talk about the steel industry or the car industry In short industry is in danger of extinction by the policies that you two traitors have been imposing one after the other And today the People 's Party to supposedly support the industry introduces a new twist of thread to these policies,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,44.5497,-3.6109939,34,thank much mr president group european people 's party bringing us initiative announces seemingly sharp support spanish industry important part initiative acceptable content could say 75 initiative another 25 totally unacceptable explain 25 full section initiative entitled protocol decarbonisation

climate issue energy closely related everyone knows indeed energy one industry 's main inputs well strong impact climate issue industry emits called co2 explain co2 costs administrative cost get idea listen us steel producing steel company spain sell every tonne steel 700 euros pay co2 emissions 132 euros guys realize represent approximately 15 final product price co2 emissions regardless costs co2 included energy production 're still talking gasoline diesel state imposes taxes representing 50 final price petrol diesel petrol 2 euros one euro taken directly administration vat excise duties excise duties value added product etc yet attack forms energy beat potential forms energy could spain think fracking oil canary islands nuclear energy etc n't like industry much reality putting industry one obvious example regulating co2 emissions car production european union drew first regulation 2007 2009 tighten demand fewer emissions punish another regulation 2011 another 2015 another 2017 another 2021 approval fit 55 plan ended giving industry blow grace within protocols decarbonisation industry people 's party introduces initiative supposedly seeks support industry 'll think co2 emissions moderated course must moderated course makes sense alternation parties done whenever ruled see 2007 2021 ruled accentuating demands industry situation industry disappearing spain gentlemen people 's party introduce measures wear attack initiatives supposedly intend support abandoned workers traitors abandoned workers abandoned industry abandoned sector proof milk production spain disappearing precisely energy costs fisheries spain danger extinction precisely among things energy costs let us talk steel industry car industry short industry danger extinction policies two traitors imposing one today people 's party supposedly support industry introduces new twist thread policies
#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Very good afternoon I will try to be very brief and quickly explain the initiative we have put forward We are debating a motion for urgent interpellation that is it comes from an interpellation that I raised last week with the Minister of Ecological Transition the Minister of Energy I asked her a number of questions in my opinion of absolute common sense and she answered a little with her political agenda and of course she did not answer any of the questions I asked her In this motion today we will vote on ten points proposed by VOX which are of absolute common sense We are going to ask you to vote separately so that each of the parties in this House has to get wet in each of these proposals and so the Spaniards who listen to us and who see us can hold each of these parties to account As an introduction it is important that we all know something that is palpable in the street and palpable in the environment Spain and Europe but today in this House we are concerned with Spain are in a situation of energy also in others but above all in energy critical We are paying the most expensive prices in the history of energy and we must ask ourselves why For many years there has been a policy in Europe and in Spain too of centralising the types of energy of de-diversifying the sources of energy used in Europe We had coal oil nuclear energy gas hydraulic both pumping and flowing solar and wind all this energy mix allowed us to diversify When it was convenient to focus the shot more on one and when on other occasions it was expensive on the other we focused on the other With this mixture we kind of survive For almost 30 years however we have been imposing what is now called the 2030 Agenda which is a strategy by which we are going to discard a number of energy sources including coal oil and nuclear and we are going to focus only on renewable energies What 's going on That when the wind does n't blow or when the sun does n't shine we have no energy What are we forced to do To burn gas because we have knocked down our thermal power plants and we have been shutting down our nuclear power plants and gas is at historical maximum prices For several issues among others because the main supplier is Russia which is progressively closing our tap and rising prices In this situation where we find those who get kicked in the ass of that supposedly green policy of that policy of focusing only on some types of energy it is the Spanish families the Spanish industry all the Spanish workers who see how they are losing their jobs or how they care about the products they buy every day to survive And this policy was precisely motivated by those who are now benefiting from it We have discovered that these green NGOs among others that of the spokesman for Podemos Mr López de Uralde president of Greenpeace Spain were financed by whom For Russia Surprise Europe 's main gas supplier It has all the meaning of the world Turns out that nuclear campaign No thank you 'remember it was financed by the Gulf countries the world 's leading oil producers and exporters Could you have known Obviously yes It was clear that they were directing European energy policy according to the interests of a few And the injured are the Spaniards also all Europeans but today we are concerned with the Spaniards As Russia hired nothing more and nothing less than a German Chancellor Prime Minister hired by one of the German oil companies and hired by one of the German gas companies gentlemen the real lobby led to its fundamental state Greta Thunberg receives precisely funding and support from lobbies who do not respond to the interests of the citizens and that 2030 Agenda which is being imposed does not respond to the interests of the Spanish but responds to the interests of not knowing who and who moreover refuse to reveal we have to give a complete turn to the energy policy of Spain That is why we bring to Congress today ten very simple measures of absolute common sense The first ask the Spaniards which prefer Reasonable energy prices or Greta Thunberg What do you prefer If as you say in VOX we are madmen and negatists and we are alone that referendum that you will convene will win it They 'd take our minds away from us Do it I am very afraid that the Spaniards will say no to Greta Thunberg ask common sense and ask for freedom Please second draw up a rational contingency plan for crises such as the one we are experiencing a plan b If the price of gas on which we depend and with which we produce between 20 and 30 of Spain 's energy continues to fire what are we going to do We need an emergency plan Third sovereignty It is clear that we are not going to be completely autonomous but let us try to be as far as possible as far as we can in order precisely to avoid depending on the influence of third parties Fourth step repeal climate laws It is very simple they focus on the interests of the Spaniards and not on the interests of their lobbies not on Gazprom 's interests not on Greta Thunberg 's interests not on Gerhard Schröder 's interests Focus on the interests of Spain Spanish industry and Spanish workers Establish a transitional framework to freeze the rise in CO2 prices Any industry that emits CO2 either to generate energy or to produce any property has to pay fees for that CO2 emission and each year these fees are charged by law Parallel Parallel I 'm telling you set up a transitional system In the meantime whatever they collect from CO2 dedicate it to lowering the bill do not do as now that they get stuck in the pocket for their chiringuitos In short we bring you a total of ten measures of absolute common sense,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,44.122643,-2.8717554,34,good afternoon try brief quickly explain initiative put forward debating motion urgent interpellation comes interpellation raised

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Thank you Good afternoon We are debating a motion that follows a very simple urgent inquiry in which we basically propose four questions four very clear points which we also call for separate votes so that each of the parties in this House can be portrayed The points in short ask for the following First we ask that since energy policy has a very serious and essential impact on the lives of the Spaniards on the well being of the Spaniards of the families and of the industries the Spaniards be consulted if they want the government to continue with an energy policy that is really disastrous and I think I am quite objective for the economic and industrial question of Spain Secondly we call on the Government to implement all possible efforts whether it is collection of those new taxes that are being invented every day or CO2 collection that it applies any of these collections to carry out a substantial reduction and in all possible elements of the bill of light that directly impact the well being of the Spaniards and our industry Thirdly we call for the removal of the absurd ban that has been included in the climate change law not only to exploit our natural resources but also to explore the potential existence of natural resources on Spanish soil this is absolutely absurd and has an absolute correlation with the price we pay for energy You think that in the United States since you have exploited your own natural resources oil and gas you have seen a substantial reduction from both Why Because when prices rise on the international market they use their own resources Ultimately the exploitation of own resources serves as a buffer to avoid international price fluctuations Fourthly we call on the Government to recover that nuclear policy which is really essential for Spain Nuclear energy is an energy that provides a stable mattress a constant supply of energy that serves where appropriate both to store it by pumping water and for consumption once again constant in all the slots of the day Spain had a nuclear policy that allowed to expand the nuclear map that we currently have but both the PP and the PSOE have been restricting reducing it and even now in the potential renewals of licensing for the operation of nuclear power plants the PSOE is refusing to do so These are perfectly possible issues that require only political will And I am no longer talking about expanding the nuclear fleet which is also possible because in each of the nuclear plants that are located in Spain not in all but in almost all there are areas to install additional reactors These are areas that are already connected to the network and already have the necessary water supplies to cool Again it would only take a small investment in these nuclear power plants because the main thing which are expropriations permits concessions and connections to the network is already done Only political will would be needed and that does not exist We ask those four questions They 're simple By the way as far as the central of Lemoniz is concerned we see that neither the Basque Nationalist Party nor the Philo Etarian Party are present here,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,44.276947,-3.0253432,34,thank good afternoon debating motion follows simple urgent inquiry basically propose four questions four clear points also call separate votes parties house portrayed points short ask following first ask since energy policy serious essential impact lives spaniards well spaniards families industries spaniards consulted want government continue energy policy really disastrous think quite objective economic industrial question spain secondly call government implement possible efforts whether collection new taxes invented every day co2 collection applies collections carry substantial reduction possible elements bill light directly impact well spaniards industry thirdly call removal absurd ban included climate change law exploit natural resources also explore potential existence natural resources spanish soil absolutely absurd absolute correlation price pay energy think united states since exploited natural resources oil gas seen substantial reduction prices rise international market use resources ultimately exploitation resources serves buffer avoid international price fluctuations fourthly call government recover nuclear policy really essential spain nuclear energy energy provides stable mattress constant supply energy serves appropriate store pumping water consumption constant slots day spain nuclear policy allowed expand nuclear map currently pp psoe restricting reducing even potential renewals licensing operation nuclear power plants psoe refusing perfectly possible issues require political longer talking expanding nuclear fleet also possible nuclear plants located spain almost areas install additional reactors areas already connected network already necessary water supplies cool would take small investment nuclear power plants main thing expropriations permits concessions connections network already done political would needed exist ask four questions 're simple way far central lemoniz concerned see neither basque nationalist party philo etarian party present
#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Anyway It 's important that everyone listens to it There is a planned plant the foundations of which were planted began to be built even the refrigeration had been built which was a cooling through sea water in Lemoiz Basque Country and by political pressures that construction was stopped All the investment had already been made millions thrown into the sea These are four very specific points to ask the Spaniards to lower the bill for light to eliminate the absurd ban on exploring and exploiting our natural resources and to recover and maintain the nuclear fleet we have in Spain These are very concrete and very simple requests I think that all the Spaniards who listen to us from their homes will agree with them and it is important that you understand that if the Socialist Party and Podemos vote against these four points is not for the well being of the Spaniards it is not because they believe that you Spaniards will be better off You do not believe that you will live better with or without these four points if you vote against this if you refuse to consult them if you refuse to lower the bills of light if you refuse to eliminate that absurd prohibition of exploiting natural resources if you again refuse to recover and maintain that plan and nuclear park in Spain is only for one reason for this ideological dogmatic and almost religious agenda called Agenda 2030 All the Socialist Party and Podemos want is to eliminate CO2 emissions They have decided that CO2 is the devil and as a good devil with religious gestures they try to drive it out of our lives They are not aware that these CO2 emissions are necessary to produce the cement that builds our houses to produce the steel that supports the foundations of our buildings to produce the electrical energy with which we heat ourselves even when we use the gas with which we heat the water of our houses CO2 is an element that today is irreplaceable unless a terrible effort is made By whom Who 's gonna have to carry out that terrible effort The Spaniards You a farmer in the province of Lérida will not be able to pull out your tractor Do you have a pig farm in Tarragona or in Lérida You will not be able to continue to exploit because both the Socialist Party and Podemos have decided that you are the enemy Are you a trucker transporter Do you carry the goods that we all consume from one end of Spain to another You will not be able to start your truck you will not be able to win the bread because the Socialist Party and We have decided that your engine is the enemy of the world and that therefore who should make the effort to eliminate that CO2 is you it is not them They will continue in their seats sitting quietly they will have their official cars The test the synod of climate bishops met in Egypt a few weeks ago and there came all world leaders How 'd it go In their private aircraft of course none went on a rowboat all were contaminated They met at a luxury hotel What did they eat Meat of course they did not eat worms as they tell us that we should eat On the contrary they went there to pontify sitting on hypocrisy and decided that diesel vehicles for example would have to disappear that was said by the Socialist Minister of Ecological Transition from Spain in 2030 There will be no diesel cars as they have said So Spaniards when you vote against think about it,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,43.3218,-0.71981174,34,anyway 's important everyone listens planned plant foundations planted began built even refrigeration built cooling sea water lemoiz basque country political pressures construction stopped investment already made millions thrown sea four specific points ask spaniards lower bill light eliminate absurd ban exploring exploiting natural resources recover maintain nuclear fleet spain concrete simple requests think spaniards listen us homes agree important understand socialist party podemos vote four points well spaniards believe spaniards better believe live better without four points vote refuse consult refuse lower bills light refuse eliminate absurd prohibition exploiting natural resources refuse recover

vote think
#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Ladies and gentlemen let them consult with us let them lower the bill and remove the ban on the exploitation of natural resources and of course nuclear resources but the basis is to ask the Spaniards Do they want the 2030 Agenda or do they want common sense Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,43.075512,-1.1919854,34,ladies gentlemen let consult us let lower bill remove ban exploitation natural resources course nuclear resources basis ask spaniards want 2030 agenda want common sense thank much
#RocíoDeMeerMéndez,"Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen do you remember Martyrdom With a pension of 500 euros a month two daughters five grandchildren seven mouths to feed and having to pay the rent Do you remember Miguel who had a dependent highly dependent woman I had to be 20 hours a day connected to a machine and I was afraid they 'd cut off the light Do you remember when the public wrote articles about Martyrdom and Miguel and when you from Podemos denounced from your accounts the energy poverty suffered by Martyrdom and suffered by Miguel Do you remember that they were asking to rehabilitate 500,000 homes a year Do you remember that energy poverty caused 7,000 deaths in Spain Do you remember how the public denounced situations of energy poverty And yet we now watch the public newspaper headline that Sánchez is going to Germany to lower energy prices to fulfill his promises with the Spanish Do you agree with the public that PP and VOX do not vote in favour of measures to lower energy prices Do you remember when the Sixth was also concerned about energy poverty in Évole 's programmes Do you remember when The Sixth was talking about family income and the price of energy Do you remember when the Sixth said we paid a lot of taxes Do you remember Do you remember when the PSOE called demonstrations for energy poverty in 2016 Or when you congratulated Christmas by also calling people to the streets on December 21 to denounce energy poverty to denounce as Mrs Montero said that seven million people had difficulty paying the bill for the light and that five million people could not pay for the heating Do you remember when Mr. Iglesias from this rostrum was questioning the minister telling him that he also wanted minutes of silence for all those who died of energy poverty in Spain Do you remember Because this happened with light at 60 euros megawatt hour and today the price of light has reached 700 euros megawatt hour Ladies and gentlemen today energy poverty affects almost 11 of the population Today the shopping basket is more expensive Today the purchasing power of the Spaniards has diminished Today poverty has increased at historical levels Today people are much poorer than when you went out on the street to tell us Ladies and gentlemen if at 60 euros the megawatt hour died 7000 people in winter due to energy poverty how many people die at 700 euros the megawatt hour Why are you two shut up Why did they stop reporting him Because you apart from hypocrites are the most antisocial government in Spanish history Because you 're the government of the most expensive light bill in history And what happened For the Spanish to understand many things have happened It has happened first of all that no one cares about Spain that bipartisanship one day decided to sell energy sovereignty that bipartisanship decided to take advantage of the companies and take shillings on the boards of directors with rotating doors shillings of which you ladies and gentlemen of Podemos have also taken advantage Little shillings that have been taken advantage of by their UGT colleagues Ladies and gentlemen the rotating mafia which you no longer criticise energy poverty which you no longer care about are real problems for the Spaniards the sale of our country 's energy sovereignty aggravated moreover by climate frivolity by all those policies that you defend from the supranational institutions from the Paris Accords the Green Pact the 2030 Agenda and its climate change law which has condemned the Spaniards to that 700 euros per hour Ladies and gentlemen the energy sector is not only deeply dependent but you have left it at the dawn of those supranational powers of those dictates that they do to you from the Davos Forum and I do not say so as the Spanish Official College of Geologists also says that Spain has not been able to harness its energy potential its raw materials and minerals to reduce its energy dependence Ladies and gentlemen it is urgent for Spain to draw up an energy sovereignty plan with real experts not with militants put to scientists as you have used throughout the pandemic Energy sovereignty is essential for national security Energy is a strategic issue for nations which you do not like and condemn Energy sovereignty is essential for a nation to be free and independent it is essential to have the capacity to protect the Spaniards it is essential for the development of the economies and for the international strength of Spain Ladies and gentlemen you called us autarchics you called us anti-Europeans you call us negatists and the only anti-Europeans here are you who have sold Europe 's energy capacity to third parties We must end your climate frivolity ladies and gentlemen because being environmentalists today is a matter of status you have nothing to do with protecting nature you impart your dogmas and fashions from Malasaña and impose them on the Spaniards and our energy sector Ladies and gentlemen you all live in a permanent fiction and it is that foreign agendas and governments will improve people 's lives No the only thing that will improve Martyr 's life and Miguel 's life is that Spain fights for energy sovereignty and the ability to protect its own Thank you so much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,47.354828,-3.301772,34,"thank

#RocíoDeMeerMéndez,Thank you Madam President We have come this morning almost late to discuss a motion resulting from an urgent inquiry by the People 's Party on aid to families in order to reach the end of the month to families who are indeed in one of the most difficult moments of recent years The point is that it is a little ironic to read the measures proposed by the People 's Party which are essentially tax cuts by a party that climbed the IRPF up to five times in the previous legislature even more so than the United Left asked It is ironic that they are proposed by the party that raised VAT to 21 the party that raised IBI It is ironic on the part of the party of the copayment of medicines to pensioners on the part of the party of the elimination of the deduction of professional diesel on the part of the party that allowed the autonomous communities to tax the hydrocarbons and the party that allowed the eviction of half Spain to come to talk about vulnerable and banks Ladies and gentlemen however and this is shared by both the People 's Party and the Socialist Party the parties of the revolving doors with these measures that you propose thank God and we all know that they are promises in the opposition and that they are most likely traditions in the Moncloa they will be scolded by their colleagues on the boards of directors Ladies and gentlemen the Spanish are very tired They do n't know how tired the Spaniards are of hearing us talk about patches permanently Look in VOX we do think we should lower taxes on the Spaniards We think we should cut public spending on things that are unnecessary and of course would help But we do not come here to say that half a point must be lowered to such a tax No no We come here to say that for families to truly reach the end of the month structural measures must be urgently addressed We have come to say that the strengthening of Spanish families necessarily involves turning back to what you have been doing for decades tens of years by auctioning our sovereignty in different areas And here 's VOX talking about sovereignty again But it is common sense ladies and gentlemen that in order to combat energy poverty that for Spanish families to be able to sell their homes and arrive at the end of the month we cannot pass a law that prevents Spanish people from exploring and exploiting their own resources We cannot base our energy policy on flying thermal power plants and shutting down nuclear power plants We have to bet on a country that truly owns its resources and that can have control over energy precisely in order to be able to control the supply and to be able to strengthen the Spanish families Ladies and gentlemen there is no use in your electoral and short term policies at four years notice there is no real use in patches in the IRPF if we continue to open the door to unfair competition that destroys our jobs and our industry Ladies and gentlemen let me see if I can get important questions asked without any prejudice According to the latest quality of life survey of the National Statistical Institute the population at risk of poverty and social exclusion accounts for 27.8 of the population which is more than 13 million people Do you believe that in Spain with more than 13 million people at risk of poverty we can truly have open border policies with which we bring seven million Africans without resources Do you really believe that this is not going to have a direct impact on the poverty of the Spaniards Do you think it is possible to put an end to social exclusion to poverty to child poverty to severe poverty to that one and a half million people who cannot even eat meat It is impossible if certain policies are implemented Ladies and gentlemen the only way to protect the Spanish hard is to protect their country hard The heroes of this story are unfortunately not the rulers the heroes of this story are the mothers of families who spend the last two weeks of the month on rice and pasta the heroes of this story are the grandparents who support the accounts of whole families with all their members unemployed with their pensions and the heroes of this story are the parents who do not even see their children so that their children can eat Ladies and gentlemen it is all the modest Spaniards to whom you have taken everything from them but who do not resign,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,40.80248,-1.7773473,34,thank madam president come morning almost late discuss motion resulting urgent inquiry people 's party aid families order reach end

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,For I believe that you are rather acting in the service of your own interest and your ideological agenda apart from the interest of the Spaniards of all conditions I do n't have friends who have more than five homes but I do n't have friends who enjoy a 450 square metre house like you where the Spaniards pay you their expenses with our taxes and you avoid the obligation to report how much they cost you So Mrs. Díaz who would want in Spain to have five medium sized dwellings that could be expropriated by being able to enjoy one of 450 meters free of charge like you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,45.87768,1.3285828,34,believe rather acting service interest ideological agenda apart interest spaniards conditions n't friends five homes n't friends enjoy 450 square metre house like spaniards pay expenses taxes avoid obligation report much cost mrs. díaz would want spain five medium sized dwellings could expropriated able enjoy one 450 meters free charge like

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,Thank you President Minister a previous one Mr de Podemos Mrs Franco we are looking forward to you ruling United We can finally lower the bill from the light You are the government of ruin of lies the worst government at the worst time but also the government of excuses and Minister you have not said it but you have surely thought that the drought we suffer in Spain is also the fault of the war in Putin yes The field agonizes dies of thirst Farmers and farmers want water they do n't want loans they want tools to work they do n't want subsidies they want legal certainty and not an endless bureaucracy they want to give people food without dying of hunger in the attempt and they want them to listen they do n't want palliatives but the chronic disease they suffer disappears and for that I 'm sorry but gentlemen of the government you must leave because that is the urgent thing you must leave This royal decree- law which the government wants to justify under the premises of urgency and extraordinary aims to mask a problem that persists in Spain for decades drought You yourself in the preamble to this rule say that in Spain from the hydrological year 2012 2013 to the present there has been a situation of precipitation well below the average ten years which I believe is sufficient time to realize Therefore you are the Government of the last minute at the stroke of royal decree law and in time of discount but it is that your inaction costs lives With this rule you are not offering a solution to the problems of the field it is another patch to cover the wound but the wound remains open even if you want to hide it by wearing bandages and the longer you leave it open in the end it will gangrene and then the field will die without remedy and if the field dies we all die Or do you think the bread comes from the oven or the potatoes from the bag and the chops from the fridge The tax and social security measures they raise are time limited measures because after ten long years of drought as we have just said you are sure thinking that from June this year it will rain a lot and the problem will disappear What for example are they based on to provide tax relief reducing IRPF yields by 20 Why not 30 or 25 or Social Security deferrals due to May or June They are discretionary measures that translate into bread for today and hunger for tomorrow I believe it is a flight forward without addressing the origin of the problem and without offering a bottom up solution I 'm going to give you some notions of mathematics for progress and basic taxation If agricultural and livestock farms as a result of the rise in prices of raw materials energy fuel and less production due to this drought have incurred losses how would they benefit from a 20 reduction in yields if they do not have yields if they do not have profits 20 of zero is zero This Minister is not a tax benefit it is a laughing stock of our farmers and farmers Since our parliamentary group arrived in Congress they have done nothing but point out to you as a negator of everything Mrs de Podemos has just done it but it is here that the only negators I believe are you that with ideological sustenance and your climate fanaticism do not want to see the reality Without food sovereignty we 'll fill the refrigerators you know what Paper from the BOE which is very ecological and very resilient Since the VOX Parliamentary Group we have put forward hundreds of initiatives that propose real long term solutions to the problems of the field but you reject them by system If the initiative is VOX we must vote no Those are their principles the denial of common sense and the well being of the Spaniards The Spanish agenda that VOX proposes yes for all of Spain that of which you sometimes want to laugh which is an agenda in front of the globalist progressive agendas in point 17 says the following Water is a resource of all Spaniards and it must be ensured that it reaches all corners of the nation through the interconnection of all basins the Ebro is also Spanish In addition a new national hydrological plan will be designed and implemented under the principles of solidarity and common good because the abandonment of the national water policy is condemning rural Spain to become thirsty and dying Spain In Spain we have 50 of our territory at risk of desertification and the opportunity to recover millions of hectares of irrigation if we are able to get enough water to all corners We must ensure that water is a resource accessible to all Spaniards in each region of the country defending farmers against the criminalization of the use of water To date only two out of every ten euros of the investment envisaged in the previous hydrological plans have been implemented so a high percentage of regulatory and water infrastructure works of general interest have not been carried out despite being decisive for mitigating droughts It must be that water is a sermasculin without a gender perspective and therefore the EUR 21.3 billion for feminist policies here should not be applied Desertification has become a real environmental problem but consensusprogress does not include it in its climate fanaticism or its green agenda Our Constitution legally establishes water as a public property in its article 132 the State being the holder of such resources which ensures that it is used on the basis of rationality and solidity criteria for all Spaniards However its arbitrary policies are devoted to territorializing decisions on the use of water in the various autonomous communities and hydrographic confederations and here in these policies the PP and the PSOE both mounts and mounts so much Therefore the distribution of water among all Spaniards is also in the Constitution or is that principle not included in your concept of solidarity and patriotism Of course we already know that the communists share what they do n't have More of the same However we shall vote in favour Minister,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,47.83127,-0.39137328,34,thank president minister previous one mr de podemos mrs franco looking forward ruling

#PabloJuanCalvoListe,Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen new transposition of European legislation into Spanish law on this occasion on precursors of explosives which are those chemicals that could be used in combination with others to make an illegal but simple homemade explosive but this government as we shall see later is unable to transpose a single norm without introducing any discordant elements Despite being legal products such as ammonium nitrate used in fertilizers but mixed with diesel it gives rise to nagolite which is the simplest explosive used in mining and which has caused some of the biggest chemical explosions in history such as that of the port of Beirut in August 2020 or oxygenated water or acetone or battery acid used in construction industry pool cleaning or wind modelling in due percentages and mixed with other substances are precursors of explosives and can be used for the manufacture of artifacts The jihadist attacks of recent years in Europe and the world have shown the need to raise the level of security and limit private access to precursors whose controls had proved ineffective by not sufficiently preventing their easy acquisition But if there is a nation that is suffering from jihadist and separatist terrorism like no other is Spain Let 's see Ripoll 's jihadist cell easily purchased large quantities of chlorine sulphuric acid and acetone substances to manufacture 300 kilos of homemade explosives known as the 'mother of Satan whose build up blew up on August 16 2017 his Alcanar villa in Tarragona with several terrorists inside The next day members of the cell killed 14 people with a van and injured dozens who were walking through Las Ramblas de Barcelona Nine CDRs were arrested while attempting to attack explosives in Catalonia coinciding with the coup judgement on 1 October Sulphuric acid aluminium powder industrial pickling gasoline and paraffin were involved They also had termite a relatively easy to elaborate component that reaches high temperatures giving it great incendiary power Come on peaceful people really peaceful In November 2021 the Civil Guard seized 350 kilos of potassium chloride in Reus a substance used as an explosive precursor denouncing its owner who was attempting to sell it illegally over the Internet A recent report by the Civil Guard sees coincidences in the manufacture manipulation and logistical aspects of explosive material and precursors found in 2019 in a series of ETA bars in France with the attack perpetrated on 30 July in Palmanova Calvià Mallorca the last terrorist action with victims that ETA committed in Spain and that ended the life of two members of the Benemerita one of them the son of my bank companion Toni Salvá The aim is to determine the identity of ETA militants related to terrorist actions committed on the islands in July and August 2009 but the prosecution is not very interested in pulling the thread examples reflecting the importance of regulating explosives precursors But what should be a purely technical legislative project with contributions that improve and complete the text has become in order not to change another transfer of the Government to the separatists and it is that the amendments presented by the enemies of Spain have been welcomed by the Socialist Group which has cooked a transaction with the Basque Nationalist Party in which it gives to the Mossos and the Ertzaintza the control and the inspection work of the precursors which until now has been performed by the State namely the Civil Guard and the Centre for Intelligence against Terrorism and Organized Crime the Citco integrated in the Ministry of the Interior as a national contact point The separatists want to be them not the State who control the potential manufacture of explosive devices similar to the gift of the PSOE with Navarra because of the PNV 's demand for traffic with the Civil Guard Always the PNV always collecting its fruits Not a day passed and the media echoed the news Here you can see Mossos wins the Civil Guard the inspection of explosives precursors Another example Sánchez gives Mossos and Ertzaintza powers of the Civil Guard on explosives inspection They want to expel the Benemerita from the territories by force to withdraw their powers as they will do with the Army at Esquerra 's request We say that the inspection of the precursors should be controlled only by the Civil Guard Weapons Intervention and not by the Major Trapero The bill is enacted under the provisions of article 149.1 26 and 29th of the Spanish Constitution which let us recall is sharp and confers on the State exclusive jurisdiction over the regime of production trade possession and use of explosives as well as in public security so that the resulting rule may be in breach of unconstitutionality We only have to know what the cost of this new transfer of Sánchez to separatism was new support The general budgets of the auctioning state Soon we will know and the Spanish will speak because in Spain as in Europe the time of the patriots has come Nothing more and thank you very

#PabloJuanCalvoListe,Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the draft Law on Contaminated Wastes and Soils and for a Circular Economy arises on the occasion of two directives of the European Union but with such a subject in the hands of this eco-fanatic government which is dedicated to demolishing thermal power plants in order to achieve a radical model that is neither more sustainable nor sovereign nor effective and that involves the destruction of our productive capacity and dependence on foreign powers with the approval of the People 's Party which has already closed the Garoña power plant nothing new could be expected both kneeling before the climate gurus of the moment and condemning the Spanish to energy poverty The fork that allowed transposition was broad but a text with 118 articles emerged which no longer liked anyone as evidenced by the large number of amendments tabled 1321 742 in Congress and 579 in the Senate And dealt with in the worst possible way with haste and last minute compromise amendments something that we are already very accustomed to A text full of ideology that does not substantially improve the amendments and that has already provoked our vote against this House and the veto in the Senate Not only do we pay more for energy for its insane climate we also pay more for getting rid of waste and all thanks to Brussels radical environmental policy Greta and foreign globalist agendas which bring us to ruin and misery As we said yesterday or green demagogy or the future of our children The result is another project that emerged from the 2030 factory and its SDGs objectives of social demolition characterized by increased state run driving more laborious and above all more tax And it is that Brussels and Sánchez create a single use rate on plastic packaging another on landfill waste storage and another on waste incineration which already apply ten autonomous communities These taxes do not serve to prevent or reduce they only seek to collect Already the Council of State 's opinion on the draft law warned precisely of the risk that these new burdens could entail an insurmountable cost for many of the economic operators In addition in case there is little the Socialist Group is submitting two amendments amending the Water Act to recover the hydroelectric fee that the electricity companies will pay The PP already did it in 2015 but wrong which forced the Supreme Court to request the return of 1908 million euros You know who 's gonna pay for this hydroelectric cannon do n't you Do n't you know I tell you each and every one of the Spaniards Economic growth will be sluggish by reducing competitiveness for businesses and harming market and entrepreneurship freedom which will eventually impact on the pocket of all families We will say it again the best residue is the one that is not generated But in the project prevention is little more than a declaration of intent without serious control mechanisms although it does establish a sanctioning regime For you prevention is to interfere in the productive models of companies by fixing which products have to be withdrawn or which ones have to be put back on the market In VOX we believe that the opposite is true it is necessary to allow the R D i departments to know how to innovate the best materials that are free of toxics and packaging prepared for the 100 recovery technology zero waste and other viable initiatives with patents and competition in the market With a progressive language that floods the whole text as a society of recycling resilience or co-governance the true intention is hidden which is nothing other than the growth of an already existing artificial waste market multiplying bureaucratic bodies from the general budgets Its longing circular economy is also not defined The only thing that circulates in the project is the money for subsidies taxes and taxes collected by the State in each phase of the recycling process The autonomous communities will have discretion in the authorizations one more step in the bankruptcy of the market unit and in the inequality between Spaniards The European Union wants to harmonise each and every criterion However what you want and what you are committed to is to develop seventeen taifas markets It is not understood that the same material has different consideration in one region of Spain or another Nor is energy recovery by incineration of non-hazardous waste envisaged more than in the last place and with prohibitive taxation when it is rapid clean within the limits of the European Union and which makes it possible to transform energy into electricity evaporative heat But they do n't like it because it's not part of the artificial and sustained business of their chiringuitos We see positive the reduction of methane emissions from landfills or farms for their transformation into biogas without criminalising farmers In twenty five years we will have an avalanche of solar panels rich in cadmium lead heavy metals to have to recycle them panels produced entirely in China the largest source of CO2 in the world All this is done to the greatest glory of the government with the European Green Pact from whose sources this project drinks but leaving a poisoned legacy to future generations Of course we must save the planet but we must save it from all of you Nothing more Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,42.896385,-4.7786703,34,thank president ladies gentlemen draft law contaminated wastes soils circular economy arises occasion

#SantiagoAbascalConde,Good morning Let 's go to the real problems of the Spaniards Mr Sánchez what measures will your Government take to put an end to the energy dependence that impoverishes Spain and that is ruining the Spanish Because we have the feeling that your government your party and your partners have lost contact with the street that they are not in the markets in the neighborhoods in the bars Because if they were they'd know that people do n't care about digital ethic citizenship color zebra steps gender based mathematics People are worried about access to housing having a stable job being able to form a family and being able to pay the bill for electricity and gas Mr Sánchez The Spaniards are sick of losing purchasing power of living worse than other generations of living worse than their parents and you only offer misery and despair when you should offer certainties Since 2020 with you inflation has risen by 6 electricity has risen by 46 butane by 47 gasoline by 23 diesel by 25 Spain has lost its energy sovereignty with you at the head of the government and you will say it is a global problem but there are different ways to captivate the temporal In Germany you have put your money on gas in France you are going to build fourteen nuclear reactors the European Union which you always obey now it seems not has just declared green gas and nuclear energy and other countries to which you are so critical like Poland have ended up with VAT so that families can pay the electricity and gas bill You bet on a decrement model and frivolities in the meantime Its model is the deindustrialization of the interior Spain the criminalization of diesel and the manufacture of vehicles in Spain the blasting of thermal power plants such as Velilla del Río Carrión in Palencia the closure of nuclear power plants such as the Garoña nuclear power plant and the gift of gas which is needed for the Spanish families to the satrap of Morocco That is their model is business that closes because they can't even lift the blind and families that can't warm up in winter because they can't pay the energy bill Their energy transition is a thyme that shows once again that when communists and socialists are in power families suffer the humble suffer the popular classes suffer and the middle classes suffer,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,45.480206,0.096775725,34,good morning let 's go real problems spaniards mr sánchez measures government take put end energy dependence impoverishes spain ruining spanish feeling government party partners lost contact street markets neighborhoods bars they'd know people n't care digital ethic citizenship color zebra steps gender based mathematics people worried access housing stable job able form family able pay bill electricity gas mr sánchez spaniards sick losing purchasing power living worse generations living worse parents offer misery despair offer certainties since 2020 inflation risen 6 electricity risen 46 butane 47 gasoline 23 diesel 25 spain lost energy sovereignty head government say global problem different ways captivate temporal germany put money gas france going build fourteen nuclear reactors european union always obey seems declared green gas nuclear energy countries critical like poland ended vat families pay electricity gas bill bet decrement model frivolities meantime model deindustrialization interior spain criminalization diesel manufacture vehicles spain blasting thermal power plants velilla del río carrión palencia closure nuclear power plants garoña nuclear power plant gift gas needed spanish families satrap morocco model business closes can't even lift blind families can't warm winter can't pay energy bill energy transition thyme shows communists socialists power families suffer humble suffer popular classes suffer middle classes suffer

#SantiagoAbascalConde,Mr. Sanchez good morning This is going to be the hardest winter in decades for the Spaniards Families are gripped by the loss of purchasing power Inflation on commodities is out of the question The fiscal pressure you hold against the Spaniards is abusive and unfair The house is a luxury for more and more Spaniards Young people think about forming a family but that 's a chimera Light and gas are directly remunerable for low rents but also for middle rents The Spanish have become poorer over these five years more than the rest of the Europeans and that has happened to you in Moncloa That is why we have come to tell you that today you have to explain all those who for example have made propaganda against nuclear power plants those who shut down the financed Garoña nuclear power plant those who have bet on the blasting of thermal power plants and those who have held it on the boards of the electricity companies Those who like you have given up on foreign policy as a whimsical autocrat causing among other things the drop in the import of Algerian gas and the import of Russian gas right now in addition to a new migratory invasion But above all the honourable Members who in this House have supported a climate law that prohibits the Spanish from exploring and exploiting their own energy resources condemning them to energy dependence as a nation and to energy poverty as a Spaniard You try to ridicule the nuclear solution by saying it's for a decade or two but it comes with a pin in the 2030 Agenda flap and presented us here with the 2050 Agenda for twenty five years We have the Spain Agenda for today the Spain Agenda for now This Government can now decide to reopen the Garoña nuclear power plant This government can stop the blasting of thermal power plants and this Parliament can vote tomorrow for the repeal of climate law which is suicide for the Spanish Do n't listen to us ask people instead of taking pictures with people who are doing so badly Use article 92 of the Constitution and consult the Spaniards if they want to continue paying the most expensive energy or if they want to explore their own natural resources,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,45.395313,0.15544483,34,mr. sanchez good morning going hardest winter decades spaniards families gripped loss purchasing power inflation commodities question fiscal pressure hold spaniards abusive unfair house luxury spaniards young people think forming family 's chimera light gas directly remunerable low rents also middle rents spanish become poorer five years rest europeans happened moncloa come tell today explain example made propaganda nuclear power plants shut financed garoña nuclear power plant bet blasting thermal power plants held boards electricity companies like given foreign policy whimsical autocrat causing among things drop import algerian gas import russian gas right addition new migratory invasion honourable members house supported climate law prohibits spanish exploring exploiting energy resources condemning energy dependence nation energy poverty spaniard try ridicule nuclear solution saying decade two comes pin 2030 agenda flap presented us 2050 agenda twenty five years spain agenda today spain agenda government decide reopen garoña nuclear power plant government stop blasting thermal power plants parliament vote tomorrow repeal climate law suicide spanish n't listen us ask people instead taking pictures people badly use article 92 constitution consult spaniards want continue paying expensive energy want explore natural resources

#SantiagoAbascalConde,Mr Sánchez you very much like to ridicule the adversaries and go up to this rostrum talking about the apocalypses with which the opposition warns you But of course you come up to this rostrum also warning of an apocalypse the climate and you ask us many questions about whether we are going to support you but you who are the President of the Government should answer our questions and I ask you for the ninth time when you are going to repeal climate legislation that ruins the Spanish and prevents us from exploring our resources Because of course Spain emits 0.7 of the world 's CO2 to the atmosphere but every time Spain reduces emissions it increases China which emits 30 well China or Russia or the United States or India China issues 30 and each year increases 5 That is the effect of your measurements on the planet is exactly zero He asks why we do n't support him Because you have brought us here to the gates of ruin dependence and even war By the way he is also full of his mouth talking about Europe but as far as the European Union is concerned that the way in which the General Council of the Judiciary is elected changes he becomes a Europhobic in a minute We do not support him because we have a duty and a mandate from our voters to keep infinite distance with his Government infinite distance with those who have supported the energy suicide of Spain infinite distance with those who bring social division and confrontation with Spain with the law of historical memory with gender laws and even again with the desecration of tombs infinite distance with those who ruin the Spanish there are a million more poor with you with those who ruin the middle and popular classes with those who raise taxes to the autonomous and those who are in debt to the next generations and infinite distance with those who rule by the hand of the enemies of Spain and the Constitution You say that the right asks you on October 12th Look no the Spaniards have pitied him because precisely in yesterday 's act very important and very solemn things are done such as the tribute to the fallen to the fallen who have been killed by the enemies of Spain those things which you said those things and people remember a 12th of October of things like that I mean we keep with you the same distance you keep with the Spaniards I insist here you come without a tie after forcing us all to change the temperature of this room but all the ushers have to come with their uniform and their tie up to the walnut You in the Falcon and with twenty official cars but the Spaniards can't fill the deposit You will be applauded by Greta but you are pitied by the Spaniards Mr Sánchez It is quite unbearable forgive my energy I have been infected with testosterone by Mr Patxi López who I see that you have delegated it to him it is impossible to hear you talk about social policy and public health when you use public money for propaganda This year 36 million more in the budgets 68 increase They give money to promote illegal immigration and the so called effect 881 million in the budgets they bring us 65 more than in their first budgets Give money to Mrs Montero 's ideological associations and yes give money to millionaires to the foundation of Bill Gates for very important things But it happens that in that fund of Mr Gates participate many millionaires who decide what they do with their money and you become millionaire with the money of the Spanish but then your government tells us that it does not fund an effective medicine against breast cancer because it is too expensive but to take a picture and for socialists to be placed in international institutions there is always money You 're a millionaire you behave like such with the money And the fact that you present yourselves here as the inventors of social security and public education and public health Excuse me for laughing I 've seen Mr. Patxi López very engulfed with social democracy He said It 's us In 1908 there was a National Institute of Prediction in Spain in 1918 there was a Retirement Worker and after the war in 39 the Old Age Subsidy was created I do n't know if you would applaud Maura or Franco Obviously things have changed many things have improved but saying that there was nothing here until you arrived is a gigantic lie that we are going to answer in this rostrum With regard to the support we have decided this weekend by the Italian prime ministers in a few days of Hungary Poland and the former President of the United States I have to tell you that Mr Trump did not start any war during his term that he signed several peace treaties that he warned Europe that it was necessary to increase defence spending and that it was necessary to end the dependence on

#SantiagoAbascalConde,Ask Mr. Biden when you chase him down the halls to see if he 's going to maintain those policies or if he 's going to change them I conclude Mr Sánchez by reiterating the question because you are talking about surveys and what Europeans think Look fewer polls and more real consultations because the polls said one thing about the Brexit the referendum on the agreement with the FARC in Colombia the attempt to boost the Constitution in Chile and the voters said the opposite when they were able to vote Less polls and ask the Spaniards if they want the energy suicide that you and this Chamber have voted for or if they want the Spaniards to have energy sovereignty Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,43.80282,1.3849819,34,ask mr. biden chase halls see 's going maintain policies 's going change conclude mr sánchez reiterating question talking surveys europeans think look fewer polls real consultations polls said one thing brexit referendum agreement farc colombia attempt boost constitution chile voters said opposite able vote less polls ask spaniards want energy suicide chamber voted want spaniards energy sovereignty thank much
#PatriciaDeLasHerasFernández,"Thank you very much Madam President Madam Minister a previous comment You have n't stopped here from talking about consensus but you know what 's out there is a strike right The Government is bringing us today a package of measures for road hauliers a package like everything they do which is deficient On July 23 2020 the Ministry of Transport Mobility and Urban Agenda undertook to study much of the sector 's claims and yet what brings us to this House today is more than insulting road hauliers They left them out of aid for fleet transformation left them out of direct aid for support for business solvency and reduced aid for the abandonment of the profession by EUR 16,000 And where are the 200 million that still owes them the health cent What about your safety Where 's your security Only thirty seven parking lots are considered safe having resulted in an increase in the theft of cargo police stations on board trucks and attacks on drivers not to mention that they have not yet been recognized all that they did for the Spaniards during the illegal confinement Then they demonstrated their capacity in deplorable conditions reducing the rest periods and putting the supply of the Spaniards to their own safety without an open bar where they could have a coffee not a single place where they could clean up But you guys that does n't matter You do n't care about transporters That 's why they left them out of aid that 's why they do n't pay them what they owe that 's why they continue to suffer assaults and thefts on their goods They are focused on their dark Agenda 2030 and the even darker interests of the radical ecolobbies that mark it From the interventions of the rest of the parliamentary groups I can conclude that it seems that with this royal decree they have managed to divert attention from what is really important This government follows a globalist agenda that captures the Europeanist positions of an energy policy that harms our transporters It is an agenda that wants to prevent private road traffic In Spain 95 of freight transport is carried out by road and this seems to clash with its beloved 2030 Agenda and its emission quota Of course our transporters will have to buy a Falcon in order to fight climate change as our president does by the way then declares it a state secret And they want to end our transporters in the only way they know by suffocating the sector We have the Eurovignette as a new toll on heavy trucks sanctions such as the premium for excess CO2 emissions or the deorbited rise in the price of hydrocarbons Gas oil accounts for one third of the costs of a sector in which six out of ten workers are self employed or companies with fewer than three trucks because we talk about family businesses we talk about families The price of fuel is the most expensive in history not even in 2008 or 2009 when oil reached 140 dollars a barrel we paid 2 euros per litre of gasoline And why Well you said it here it 's Putin 's fault Putin's Franco's or the heteropatriarchy anyone 's fault if they do n't recognize political responsibilities However this government is pocketing no less than EUR 250 million a month for the rise of fuels because let us remember the taxes that charge them are 21 VAT and more than 30 excise duties And far from compensating for these measures by reducing hydrocarbon taxes as other states such as Poland have already done as those 250 million go very well they go and tell the carriers to solve the paper themselves with the impact on prices and so on Just as VOX is on the side of our field to protect our farmers from unfair foreign competition we are on the side of our carriers which are a key strategic sector that should be a priority for this government And in case all this is not enough they also want to implement a payment system on all the high capacity roads in Spain In this regard my parliamentary group took a non-legislative motion to prevent this new abuse to the Transport Committee meeting on 24 February Well all the groups in line with that globalist agenda voted against except for the People 's Parliamentary Group and I say except for the vote because we all know that some of its leaders also obey the globalist agenda The multiple and repeated VOX proposals for this sector have been systematically rejected Not a single measure that gives them oxygen families that lose their livelihood and their trucks and have nowhere to survive and give them structural answers Thus every step this Government takes is one more step towards the poverty and ruin of all Spaniards If they really cared about transporters they would lower taxes on hydrocarbons and eliminate the commitment made with Brussels to implement a payment system on all high capacity roads in Spain the Eurovignette or green taxes However they suffocate them just as they suffocate all Spaniards with the rise of the price of light and gas the announcement of new taxes or inflation triggered And why are they suffocating them To distribute 20 billion in inequality policies and to maintain the most expensive government structure in Spain 's history They come here with the tougher face than the sole of a shoe to bring a package of measures that have had the little shame of calling measures to improve the sustainability of the transport of goods by road and the operation of the logistics chain It is a real insult when it is precisely this Government that is responsible for the increase in prices and the cause of the situation in which our carriers find themselves And that 's why I 'd like the minister to listen to me but the message goes to the Spaniards do n't worry For this reason and for 20 billion more reasons I encourage all transporters to join as we will do this Saturday the 19th in the demonstration convened by the Union Solidarity before the municipalities of all Spain not for those grateful stomachs of Workers

#PatriciaDeLasHerasFernández,"Thank you very much Mr President Last year this Government raised the salary of senior officials of the Ministry of Transport while leaving thousands of families unemployed and closing the Spanish business This year the entire Government has raised its salary as inflation goes off and households have to be covered with fatter blankets because their climate fanaticism makes them unable to pay for heating And the minister tells us that this budget that of her ministry is the most social in history Not for transporters Minister whose retirement aid is maintained at less than 10 million although more than half of the applicants are excluded due to a lack of budget depriving them of a decent retirement He 's been reading budgets for half an hour but he's had the little shame of not quoting this item It will be that the transporters are part of those whom his Government calls rich Or perhaps they do n't deserve it because as you yourself have said they are ultra right groups that are trying to subdue this country and that are playing the game to Putin are n't they Minister There are 10 million for transporters and 190 million for their migration policies which as the former Minister of Transport acknowledged two years ago are ambitious broad exceed this ministry and follow the guidelines marked by a globalist agenda Of course it was ceased immediately after making these statements which they tried to make disappear They are the government of propaganda but what they hide behind are the sickle and the hammer and the Davos Forum of course They 're wolves with lamb skin They say that these budgets are the most social in history but as I have told you they deprive transporters of a dignified abandonment But not just that They say they take care of the working classes but they suffocate them with taxes They talk about depoliticizing justice but what they want is their control They say they protect minors and women but they take rapists out of jail and oppose the investigation of the prostitution of children under guardianship in the Balearic Islands They say they want to end corruption but they want to eliminate the crimes of sedition and embezzlement They say that pollution must be stopped but our autocrat president mobilizes an Airbus and the Falcon to attend the Climate Summit And here the People 's Party does not differ at all from the socialists because Feijóo another accomplice of the same globalist agenda calls for the removal of vehicles of more than ten years from a pen which will cause tens of thousands of families to run out of cars making it a luxury property and Moreno asks Sánchez that the 2025 summit the Climate Summit be held in Andalusia We deserve it he says No ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party and the Government what the Spaniards deserve are budgets that watch over their present and their future and that do not spoil the fruit of their tax based work to waste in a distribution of the cake intended to secure the government pacts with those who want to destroy Spain What they deserve are budgets that guarantee the welfare state of all Spaniards not politicians trade unions and chiringuitos What they deserve are budgets that allow young people to access a home form a family be able to save and prosper and not have to look at the price of what it means to fill the petrol tank or turn on the heating In short they deserve budgets that do not obey an imposed agenda that no Spanish has chosen because who voted for their destructive 2030 Agenda gentlemen of the government The star measure is 665 million for the free travel of nearby and mid-distance a measure that in the face of lack of control has caused chaos and that trains travel practically empty despite being complete preventing other users from making use of the train And this as Renfe 's rates increase for AVE and long distance and also as plane tickets increase no less than 24 compared to 2019 and AENA depends on a regulatory solution to save its electric cost because oh surprise we depend energetically on third countries He talks about a long list of infrastructure budgets that since you have no time limit it is impossible for me to repeat but I answer him with one word enough for me inexecutions Infrastructure projects carried out year after year and the few that run are at least insulting such as the Extremadura pedal train Could you explain to me by the way what are those infrastructures with a gender perspective as you tell us In housing the illegal occupation in Spain has increased by 40 since 2018 not a single euro of these budgets is destined to combat the occupation but of course according to the Minister of Equality is a problem invented by the right By the way we are all invited to the forum that is being held this Friday by the VOX Parliamentary Group on Okupation and Inqui Okupation There will be great professionals and victims of this phenomenon Maybe they learn something She talks to us Minister about housing development What was your 2018 Plan 20,000 homes I 'm telling you all propaganda zero delivered The housing law for its part has been stuck for two years Its approval is delaying the Government because the repression of the General Council of the Judiciary including a negative report which rejects the Government 's housing law has already taken place Nevertheless both the minister and government representatives say that they will move forward with the agreed text And what does this remind us of The law alone is yes It is aimed directly at destroying what they claim to protect in this case it will destroy the supply of housing making it even more impossible to access it especially the working classes A whole history to remember They are writing the most harmful pages of Spanish politics Finally there can be no support for budgets based on the abolition of the crime of sedition which should not be reduced on the pretext of being homologated with Europe Why do n't they get homologated in the condemnation of communism who by the way invented Czechs to torture and murder That is what I remind the Member of Podemos who said this morning that democracy in Spain exists thanks to the communists This regime has been condemned by Europe to equate it to Nazism for its crimes and you on the other hand not only govern with communists but also pay them for institutional publicity with the money of all Spaniards commemorating the centenary of the Communist Party of Spain whose criminal ideology had to set a steel curtain from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea so that no one would escape from its tyranny which has enslaved the island of Cuba and which causes Venezuelans to emigrate for millions I 'm on my way The Sanchist Government arrived on a motion of censure and was going to end corruption Yes they are going to end it but by way of the repeal both of the sedition in exchange for the coups approval of these budgets as well as the embezzlement of public flows and by the way save Sánchez and Griñán for the personal eagerness to stay in Moncloa and secure his own welfare state They sell Spain to the worst bidders and with the money of all Spaniards In conclusion Mr President As you have said Minister you are not willing to give up any vote but you are willing to give up your dignity to approve these ruin

#EmilioJesúsDelValleRodríguez,With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen as Mr Mazón rightly points out in his motion the relevance of the Solvay Chemical industrial complex in Torrelavega which makes it a key agent within the productive fabric of Cantabria is well known Mr. Mazón also pointed out in his speech that Solvay has designed the start up of an energy production plant from alternative fuels which will replace the current coal Well what Mr Masones does not explain is that the Cantabria government had this project on the table more than three years ago that it lost the cart of the European decarbonisation funds which other companies were able to benefit from and that it took more than two years to process the file and get all the reports required by Cantabria 's regulations for these procedures Of course it is curious because the Cantabria government demands too many reports I remember to see how they act a director general who when he had been a director for a year and a half said to his officials I have been a year and a half and you have never prepared a decree or rule for me to take to the Governing Council and regulate something And they asked What do you want us to do Whatever may be within our competence and above all one thing that we have to issue a mandatory report on something he replied That is the level that is what is in the Community of Cantabria and Mr. Mazón knows him who has been a counselor just like me It turns out that a company arrived it has passed very recently barely three years ago Santander Coated Solutions to create eight hundred jobs already had the land and had spent a million euros to rotate because when it had been waiting two years for it to finish informing the last general address that it had to do it went to León and in three months it built instead of Santander Quoted Solution León Quoted Solution We have lost eight hundred jobs because the Cantabria Government does not know how to process files It has a decadent industrial fabric because they have at the head of the Industry Council a lord of the Regionalist Party who is a Latin teacher and who is more dedicated to tourism By the way in this area of tourism there are complaints from the unions which is already difficult that Workers Commissions denounced the cantabria socialist regional party that they have placed all the friends and related to the party which is known as low intensity corruption Well that 's the regional socialist party in Cantabria That 's right Revilla goes on television she wants to set an example of everything of governance and so on However Mr Revilla for those who do not know presides over the Autonomous Community of Cantabria but does not govern lets do it There is a tentade there that by the way whenever there is a committee of inquiry in Parliament and they quote it it immediately says I know nothing that my adviser Just like when he was caught with the cigar on the terrace at the time that he himself had banned smoking he said I do n't smoke I do n't know anything Well unfortunately that 's the reality of Cantabria They do n't have industrial plans they do n't have plans for livestock The truth is that it is a pity this region for those who know it and those who have known it in other times because they can see how the whole Besaya area is which is precisely where the Solvay factory is located how Torrelavega is which we can describe as the capital of Besaya and which had a great trade until twenty years ago many of them better shops than those of Santander which is the capital and now it 's hard to pass there it 's all closed everything is local for rent for sale there is nothing of trade Why Because this was an industrial zone and the whole industry is abandoned paralyzed My group will always support everything that is necessary to reactivate the industry Do not think that we are the ogres who will oppose all sensible measures Everything that is necessary and enters within reasonable possibilities we will support it What we are not going to support is those measures derived from those radical ecological mantras that you have generated derived

#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,Thank you Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The way this government is facing the energy crisis has consisted of a series of patches a series of self contradicting bandages The Government constantly contradicts itself How many times did the Minister of Finance tell us that it was impossible to lower VAT from electricity to 5 Finally they had to do it as on the other hand I had asked VOX many times Once again VOX was right and this government is only right when it listens to the opposition As for the famous 20 cent discount on fuels it has already been devoured by the dizzying rise in prices the litre of gasoline was at 1.81 euros on 1 April and is now at 2.14 euros But VOX is not limited to criticizing these bandages these erratic patches of the government because we believe that the shortcomings of this government 's energy policy are not only short term but structural It is the very conceptual framework of this energy policy that suffers from serious shortcomings It is a wrong framework based on climate obsession and the renunciation of energy sovereignty Therefore in this motion we do what we do is to present the master lines of which would be the energy alternative of VOX an alternative based on exactly opposite principles For example we bet on energy sovereignty Our energy dependence at the moment is 74 we import natural gas annually in the amount of 379 terawatts hour 57 million tonnes of oil and 4 million tonnes of coal for a total price of around EUR 19 billion per year By the way governments of both the People 's Party and the Socialist Party dismantled at the time our coal industry Other European countries at the moment are resorting again and again to open coal plants to deal with the emergency it is the case of Germany or also to compensate for the inadequacies of renewable energy in which by the way Germany is a leader The problem is that the climate change law passed a year ago and only VOX voted against it definitely sinks us into energy dependence especially under its articles 9 and 10 which no longer prohibit exploitation if any the investigation of possible hydrocarbon deposits in the Spanish subsoil it also prohibits uranium mining In history it had never been seen that a country gave up its own resources and they were resources that could be very important A study by the Conseil Superior de Colegios de Ingenieros de Minas has encrypted the probable reserves of natural gas in the Spanish subsoil at 1.3 billion with be cubic meters And a 2013 Gesal report referred to potential oil reserves of 2 billion barrels a reservation that yes would only be accessible through hydraulic fracture technology that technology that has allowed the United States to achieve energy self sufficiency The consultant Deloitte estimated that putting these possible hydrocarbon reserves into operation would create 260 000 jobs and increase Spanish GDP by 4.3 Therefore if VOX comes to the government that will do so it will be to repeal that delusional climate change law that prevents us from taking advantage of our own resources We will also take Spain out of the Paris Agreements the European Green Pact and any international agreements that force our economy to join that hysterical accelerated and ruinous decarbonisation process a process that is going to have it is already having an astronomical cost that Spanish companies and families simply cannot afford And I am not exaggerating it is the PNIEC itself our PNIEC which recognises the need for 240 billion decarbonising investments by 2030 when the European Green Pact talks about the need for 260 billion decarbonising investments per year to achieve the proposed targets of reducing European CO2 emissions by 55 compared to 1990 levels Speaking of CO2 there is something that very few people know and it is that the European Union is currently responsible for only 9 of global CO2 emissions and Spain is responsible for a negligible 0.7 Europe is going to get poorer and crush its economy Therefore if it were to achieve that 55 reduction we would be reducing global emissions by only 4 or 5 The planet would n't even give up In other words all this voluntary impoverishment of Europe will have an impact on global warming of only a few hundredths of a degree the warming of the planet in 2100 instead of being 1.81 oC will be 1.79 oC That 's what we 're gonna get with our sacrifice By the way this eventual warming of 1.8 or 2.3 oC in 2100 does not in any case pose an existential threat to humanity as the followers of the climate apocalyptic sect proclaim Warming is more of a problem than humanity has in the 21st century but to which our descendants will no doubt adapt without greater problems On the other hand it is also little known that Europe has already done its homework European emissions have been falling for twenty five years Spanish emissions reached their historical peak in 2005 and since then have been cut by 35 no less European emissions by 22 In the same time frame China 's emissions have doubled since 2005 and tripled since the 1990s Therefore while Europe takes a shot at its foot and lashes its economy with this useless sacrifice China sees the path to world economic supremacy expedited I 'm on my way Other principles of our energy alternative are that Spain insists within the European Union the abolition of the CO2 emission allowance market and above all that the useful life of the seven nuclear reactors that we have left be extended and that construction be

#MaríaMagdalenaNevadoDelCampo,"Thank you President The 2030 Agenda is the Trojan horse of postcommunism Let 's go with what we call conspiracy Spain does not deserve that in the face of this food crisis farmers cannot grow food not just because of a question of quotas but because some billionaire claims to be the world 's only food supplier Here it is 100,000 hectares and adding Bill Gates is raising the largest agricultural empire in the United States We continue Spain does not deserve a billionaire club to decide to demonize meat to favor its synthetic food businesses Here it is Bill Gates Rich nations should start eating synthetic meat Spain also does not deserve that families cannot pay for energy because a group of billionaires who do not speak Spanish have forbidden us to explore and exploit our natural resources Here it is Bill Gates and Warren Buffett invest in nuclear megaprojects to revolutionize energy Spain does not deserve Pedro Sánchez to give EUR 130 million to Bill Gates Here it is Pedro Sánchez donates 130 million to an entity founded by Bill Gates Nor do we deserve the 2030 Agenda 's impositions to force parents to clean up the garbage that some school children bring because educators mislead them Here it is Get a girl and a child out of class to simulate a blowjob Spain has not come this far so that the Government will become the censor authoritarian irresponsible father and supplier of misery instead of doing what it has to do which is to promote prosperity and give service to the Spaniards and that communism needs poor to remain in power We thought there was nothing more dangerous than the PSOE about to lose an election but there is it 's the PSOE supported by communists and parties who want to break Spain They took us to the edge of the cliff This post communist agenda involves the widespread impoverishment of the population the liquidation of the sovereignty of nations and is a frontal attack on the families life and roots of the West We therefore urge the Government to immediately cease blind obedience to this agenda that has not been designed to improve the lives of the Spaniards We urge you to give us a voice to decide whether we want a Spain that is confronted and with indignant inequalities between regions or a State that serves unity and solidarity between territories We have to decide whether we want a Spain blackmailed by separatists or a united and strong Spain the lie of historical memory and the black legend or the true contribution of Spain to the history and protection of national identity We must decide whether to destroy jobs or create jobs The time has come to decide whether we will continue to consent to the demonization of the rural world or whether we will defend hunting bulls our customs and traditions We must choose between eating meat or eating worms climate fanaticism and green policies that ruin the countryside or the care of the traditional environment energy dependence and the ruin of families or the conservation and construction of power plants that provide us with energy sovereignty continuing attacks on or protection of private property a justice tailored to bipartisanism or a depoliticized and real justice We must decide between the effect called on the criminals of the world or organized immigration of quality and defense of our borders an environment of distrust between men and women and criminal asymmetry or harmony real equality and reparation for constitutional rights No woman in Spain should face the drama of aborting because she does not find support for motherhood We do not want the imposition of perverted morale in schools we want the freedom of parents to choose the education that best suits and that best matches their values and principles Either we protect the wolf who kills the whole flock to eat a lamb or we protect the wolf 's flock In front of the culture of death life in front of the gag the word in front of the

#PedroJesúsRequejoNovoa,With your permission Mr. President The motion they present is based on at least highly questionable assumptions the anthropocentric origin of climate change If not the climate emergency that permeates all its political action that of progressive consensus would fall to them like a castle of cards They call it climate religion but I see them more as a sect an inquisitorial sect in which the dissident is socially canceled They annihilate hope and young activists have appeared who dedicate themselves to cultural alter terrorism in museums In order to generate more panic we are told that this crisis precedes the one caused by the Putin war and that it is of scarcity that we have already reached the peak of oil production Geologist Marion King Hubbert predicted it in 1956 for the year 1970 Campbell for the year 2000 and however in 2016 it consumed more than twice as much oil as in 2000 Can it not be that the decrease in the discovery of new deposits is due to the lack of prospecting by oil companies which no longer see these investments profitable in a decarbonized and fanatized world Europe accounts for 10 of global CO2 emissions of which Spain is only 0.7 while China alone represents a third and has neither come to COP 27 nor India or Russia Only Europe substantially lowers its emissions and the recent climate change law of 2021 seems to them little Have you asked in the oil complex of Tarragona what consequences their occurrences will have They threaten us with an apocalyptic future and sell us as progress the renunciation of the private vehicle when it has been a conquest of freedom for the middle and working class What do Lérida 's paychecks think of having to buy an electric tractor within ten years Do you see it possible They tell us about a fair transition and the Spaniards do not trust they know of the false promises in the mining basins and that only the abandonment was left Of the thermal plants blown by the air suspect that they will run the same fate The current state of Zorita 's nuclear power plant is an example Before 600 people worked today 50 and they 're waiting for full dismantling They have been unable to create new jobs Their progress is as bleak as the shirts they come to Parliament with They 've lost ethics and aesthetics They want to go further behind the Spain of the 600 and remember You will have nothing and you will be happy On the basis of renewables alone it is impossible to maintain the current level of energy consumption by collecting a diffuse energy which is the sun unpredictable like the wind the ecological footprint will be much higher We are not negatists just agnostics of their climate blind faith and therefore demand prudence and preserve a varied energy mix A varied mix is to include to a large extent photovoltaic and wind but respecting the landscape and landscape and to enhance solar self consumption and distributed generation We proposed in the climate change law a land management to place renewables and conserve land use to farmers and livestock farmers and avoid speculation speculation that the minister recognized on this same stand the day he answered them as well as recognized the lack of energy storage so we demand the transformation of dams into pumping reservoirs and that they be a condition in the new leaflets of the concessions that will expire A varied mix would be not only to conserve nuclear power but to invest in the future with small modular reactors which revitalized a Spanish nuclear sector that is still leading the world and will consume irradiated fuel so it makes no sense to build a deep geological storage as announced in the seventh waste plan Rectify and build the ATC which is optimal in security and have the site and the money collected million dollar investments in studies and accesses already made Thus the construction of the hot cells that Zorita needs will be saved first of all when the reactor safe is dismantled There is no sense in seven warehouses scattered throughout Spain and less if the power stations are closed A reasonable mix is not to prohibit prospecting studies and take advantage of Spain 's resources of radioactive minerals and hydrocarbons Thus the Spanish will have energy at a reasonable price and not the energy poverty with which they seem to have resigned VOX will work tirelessly to stop Sanchez

#PedroJesúsRequejoNovoa,"With your permission President The Constitutional Court ruled twice in the years 2016 and 2019 that the tax intended to be doubled by the Government of Sánchez was unconstitutional There was still no timetable for nuclear closure so there was no need in neo linguage for a just transition The compensation proposed in the regions that have suffered from the closure of coal mining or thermal power plants has been an absolute disappointment The example of the closure of Garoña ten years ago has meant only the construction of a small pier still without boats and houses of rural tourism while 1,200 megawatts of photovoltaic projects are requested that will create a landscape that is not compatible with the tourism If you really want to secure a future for the surroundings of Vandellós and Ascó what you must do is build Vandellós II and Ascó II We have proposed to reopen Garoña with a new modular reactor It is impossible to replace the six hundred jobs he had with fair transition plans In the year 2020 the third is the end the Generality established a tax disguised of ecologicalism tax on the installations that affect the environment they called it Sánchez said he would appeal to the Constitutional Court but he did n't dare It contravened the pact signed a year earlier between the electricians Enresa and the Government which established the closing schedule for the seven nuclear reactors a fund for the management of radioactive waste and seemed to provide a definitive tax framework For VOX this autonomous tax means double taxation which violates inter alia the principle of economic capacity and the right to freedom of enterprise enshrined in articles 31 and 33 of the Constitution It is confiscatory in nature with this tax they suffocate the generation of almost 60 of the electricity of Catalonia In April 2022 insatiable the tax went up and VOX appealed it to the Constitutional Court one of the 44 unconstitutionality appeals on the Sánchez package the set of secret agreements signed with the enemies of Spain Sánchez 's pack tries to bring irrevocable ages closer to the Basque Country to pardon the coupsmen of the process to promulgate the ideological legislacies that no one claimed such as Lomloe that of abortion the law of Herod euthanasia yes is that of historical memory that of citizen security the decriminalization of the insults to the king and of course to make life impossible for the nuclear industry to shut down itself This Government is clearly hostile to all nuclear matters Eco-friendly night before the fall of the wall of its preferred partner makes them ignore a leading industry that exports 70 of its activity to more than forty countries For example we produce nuclear fuel rods exporting more than half to countries such as Belgium France Sweden or Finland The control rooms of 21 nuclear power plants are being exported to China The U.S. aviation industry purchases ultrasonic systems and materials fatigue detection developed by Tecnatom The Spanish nuclear industry collaborates in the design of several SMRs around the world The national industry would account for 80 of the construction programmes for a new reactor in Spain That is the challenge we should be facing rather than wasting time trying to convince this government of the need to start the Villar de Cañas warehouse at once or to convince of the strategic value of our last seven reactors which provide Spain with 20 of electricity and stabilize the grid being a rotating energy They are the same as in the United States which has extended its service life to 80 years The sixth generation of coming reactors cool down alone in case of shutdown In addition they are safer and cheaper while being modular being able to quickly increase their power so they can serve as a back up to renewables and use as fuel much of the radioactive waste generated by the current ones It is no use reminding this government of the 27 000 stable and quality jobs of the Spanish nuclear industry Nor does it correct the Government with which the taxonomy of the European Union has included it as green energy or with which Germany changes and does not close its last three reactors This Government says over and over again that nuclear energy is the past and only the reality of the nuclear boom being produced is being denied together with the 450 nuclear power plants in operation the construction of 483 new ones has been announced Sánchez has turned the world around eight times in Falcon but it has not
