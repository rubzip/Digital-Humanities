#deBertoldiAndrea,DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President to mention the figure of Maria Romana De Gasperi for some thirty years is a reason not only for special honour but also for reflection and emotion For all those who were born in Trentino the De Gasperi family and Father Alcide have always been a cultural ideological and behavioral reference When we think of Maria Romana De Gasperi we refer to a figure far from secondary in the history of our democracy In paying tribute to and expressing the deepest condolences on behalf of the Brothers of Italy Group we want to remember how important Maria Romana was a daughter who was able to be at the side and at certain times in the shadow of her father and a person who knew not to seek the protagonism but precisely for this reason to be the protagonist of the cultural and political life of our country We owe her so many cultural moments She was the founder and honorary president until her death of the De Gasperi Foundation a foundation that collected all the documentation on the cultural and political history of Alcide De Gasperi a man of the other century who lived not only at the turn of time but also at the turn of a historical reality that saw our territory pass from belonging to the Habsburg Empire Austro Hungarian to the Italian State De Gasperi lived as a protagonist in the two phases of belonging to Trentino to different worlds and different historical realities I would like to recall the figure of Maria Romana as a witness to all the moments of her father 's life for example the moments in which her father represented the rebirth of this country its democratic and liberal rebirth He represented a strong barrier in the face of the drift of communism in the post war period which risked bringing Italy into a situation certainly not suited to the wishes of the Italians De Gasperi in the post war years was the barrier to communism he represented the liberal and Catholic democratic values that led our country to the years of economic development and boom Maria Romana 's work has been much appreciated by all of us because she has been able to testify to the role that her father had for our nation for our citizens and for the values that we all want to embody today in our political activity and in our daily life I would also like to stress the commitment of Maria Romana to remember the figure of De Gasperi as the protagonist of an autonomy that let me say was partly betrayed after her death De Gasperi conceived the regional autonomy that autonomy of the Trentino Alto Adige Region that had to give perspectives to a peripheral mountain territory which certainly also had problems of coexistence And he gave it to him because De Gasperi 's regional perspective also following the De Gasperi Gruber agreements I start the conclusion was decisive for our Trentino The Trentino then recalls the figure of Maria Romana and Father Alcide with the utmost respect and with the utmost mourning We turn to the family to express our closeness and our thoughts,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,2.885863,0.7473668,37,de bertoldi fdi mr president mention figure maria romana de
