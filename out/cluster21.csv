#JuanLuisSteegmannOlmedillas,With all due respect Madam President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen A preview I do n't know how you socialist ladies and gentlemen dare to appoint Professor Ernesto Lluch after signing a pact with the heirs of his murderers What color was the ink they used Ladies and gentlemen we are in an unprecedented health crisis within an unprecedented political crisis in which the Government itself is allied with the enemies of the nation The government has already destroyed the sanity and it has done so since the day it let in Wuhan 's coronavirus Ladies and gentlemen there is no National Health System it is an entelequia which as it does not have has no address telephone or website The definitive proof of this is that in this session we are discussing less than 10 of public health expenditure The rest of the expenditure is freely arranged by the autonomous rates with the transfers made to them by the State and the IRPF section In 2022 self government spent 73 198 million on health care However we have a health expenditure of 40 lower than the eurozone 's median At the same time the autonomous communities spend 40 on public debt I repeat health spending on autonomy 73 198 million amount we are discussing today including Muface 5933 There is no National Health System Mrs Darias there is an inter-autonomic system that lacks information about resources about its professionals about its functions about its results a system of ministates all socialist ideas and that has been immobilised for decades Are you laughing I 'm right fine Health care Minister since we are in good shape who has kept it It has been maintained by health personnel and in particular doctors and their vocation In this system these staff cynically asked to applaud on the balconies earn 20 less than in 2008 and 40 have temporary contracts Are you surprised that you are fleeing Spain when doctors are the worst paid in Europe when the deaths of Spanish healthcare professionals have been the largest in the world and have found no reward By the way economic reward which is how to do when you work well Is it lawful to ask health professionals to trust a government that allowed them to protect themselves with garbage bags No no Yes ladies and gentlemen the health situation is critical And I tell you one thing the main source of contempt and loss of legitimacy are waiting lists a chronic disease aggravated by the epidemic 2.35 million surgeries are still pending we have a shameful surgical waiting list record with 706 000 patients and 4 month median waiting patient waiting list for specialist 4 month median waiting And what do you do What do you budget to put an end to temporality Nothing With inequity in access Nothing With the delay in approving new drugs Almost nothing It is an insult that the Sánchez government has decided to increase its budget less than that of the lady who defends pederasty It 's a shame It is a disgrace that the cinema grants are 158 million and the Strategic Framework for Primary Care is 179 million Horrible television 691 million primary assistance in total just under 500 million These budgets do not solve the urgent problems of our health I have spent decades hearing from the consultation from the plant the buzz the runrun of these experts all always the same always on the left talking about the problems like surrounding a wall that they would like to make fall on the basis of conferences Not anymore However they said interesting things For example what should we do now according to our point of view To launch three emergency plans to put an end to waiting lists by relying on private health yes Mrs Medel to put an end to the temporary situation to increase the salaries of health workers which deserve this increase more than other public employees yes I say and more than all of us by the way to increase public expenditure per capita which is 40 lower than in the eurozone and to stop identifying public service with public management A strong ministry Minister as we propose should have a strong voice in the Fiscal and Financial Policy Council a strong voice taking advantage of the weight of the money transfers made to the autonomous communities At the same time the Cohesion Fund should be provided with a sufficient fund for specific policies None of that gives us these budgets They are budgets based on tirites bought in a Chinese as if not by a government that only thinks about surviving and is indifferent to the health of the Spaniards at least that 's what I think The inter-autonomic health system Minister is a framework that prevents us from having in Spain a real National Health System that must leave behind other spoiled formulas from a left wing era that has passed Budget Of the ruin that are not only the symptom of the failure of a system they are the symptom of the failure of a government that does not believe in Spanish health because it has neither believed nor wants to believe in Spain Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,19.012405,-19.657877,21,due respect madam president good afternoon ladies gentlemen preview n't know

#CalandriniNicola,"Mr President I would like to join in the thanks of the majority rapporteurs to Mr Pesco who has always used a great deal of attention in the work of the Budget Committee to this decree law However let me also say that for the umpteenth time we are discussing a decree law that will see the intervention of a single Chamber so we are faced with a de facto monocameralism and yet another vote of confidence It is a fact that we cannot pickle The rapporteurs are right when they say that this de facto decree is overcome by events but I would like to point out that the measure was already insufficient and exceeded even before 27 January and before the conflict between Russia and Ukraine On this we must be intellectually honest I will give some figures showing that this decree was already passed when it was issued by the Council of Ministers It is a text with weak and insufficient measures Among the speeches I would like to mention in Article 1 which contains support measures for closed activities including discotheques a fund of just EUR 20 million is allocated slightly increased with the amendments to the decree which are small if we consider that this sector has ceased its activity for almost two years reopening with limitations only in the summer months and briefly before the last wave of pandemics which saw them remain closed until a month ago The sector calculates losses of 1.2 billion euros and has seen tens and hundreds of companies surrender closing their activities These numbers are enough to understand why the resources are completely insufficient Another area on its knees is tourism to which Article 4 allocates an increase of EUR 100 million in the National Tourism Fund which was established under the last budget law This fund was provided with EUR 280 million and today it has an additional 100 million i.e. 380 a budget which has been defined by the category as largely insufficient In fact in order for the resources to be at least sufficient they would have had to be at least doubled The same applies to the EUR 200 million fund for the relaunch of economic and retail activities which is also largely insufficient to help a sector with a deficit of EUR 1.7 billion to return to pre-pandemic levels On these scenarios which are certainly worrying there is the shadow of the expensive bills which have already been mentioned by my fellow rapporteurs which are at least in conflict with the measures contained in this decree law Statistics today tell us that the price of gas has increased by more than 600 per cent compared to 2020 similarly made the price of electricity and without this the measure we examine is limited to granting facilities to energy companies even these insufficient ones giving instead limited benefits to many small and medium sized enterprises that will also suffer from the expensive energy In our opinion this decree lacks a structural vision to solve the problem because we need an imposing intervention from Europe we need to reason in terms of deviations and this Government is still not convinced it does not talk about it and President Draghi continues to niche on this aspect We need a new recovery fund because if we do not go in this direction we alone will not be able to solve these problems because we lack the awareness that we have put in place faulty energy policies which have been made in the name of extreme environmentalism and a no regardless of any plant We have brought Italy to depend totally on the foreign countries for its supplies The approach contained in this decree law is entirely temporary and aimed at buffering only partially an emergency that as I said before exploded before the tensions between Russia and Ukraine and is clearly destined to worsen with the ongoing conflict Confindustria estimates that from 2019 to 2021 the cost of energy for manufacturing increased from 8 billion in 2019 to 21 in 2021 up to 37 billion in 2022 Faced with these numbers analysis by the CGIA di Mestre points out that the interventions of this decree law cover only 6 of all the increases that have occurred which in the meantime put at risk 500,000 jobs We risk employment and we need to intervene with structural measures which this and the previous decree laws have never done We must also say something about Article 28 the case of the superbonus which shows how this Government operates We all agreed that scams should be restrained avoided but obviously if they were there there is only one person responsible this Government the Government of the Best Moreover the Revenue Agency has spoken clearly and has given us certain numbers in relation to the scams As for the 110 percent building bonus only 3 percent is related to scams are other bonuses that have had a big problem so the excitement that has led to about 14 changes in two years for this incentive appears to have rather fragile bases The hope is that the new corrections just inserted will be the last correctives to give to Italian families and companies who want to take advantage of this incentive at least legal certainty as should happen in a civil state Unfortunately with these interventions in the name of combating fraud the Government has managed to strike one of the few sectors that showed a genuine rebound that of building While GDP increased by 6.5 in 2021 this is due to a third of the construction sector which in the past year alone marked an increase in output by 24 11.8 in employment 27.7 in hours worked and 16.4 in investment All of this has been translated into greater revenue for the state 's coffers as have also certified the Budget Offices with regard to VAT Irpef Ires and IRAP Article 28 was clearly exceeded by the provisions introduced by Decree Law No 13 of 2022 Finally the subject of the scrap b and the balance and excavation it is true there has been a further step there has been an improvement but it is not enough It 's too little because nobody says what is involved in scraping b it covers until 2017 it keeps out all the periods that preceded and followed the pandemic 2018 2019 2020 first year of pandemic 2021 are not covered The break up b is a postponement of the terms of problems that have occurred until 2017 therefore it is necessary to go further it needs more courage It is not enough to measure the postponement of a deadline among other things a few months We must intervene on this It is said that resources are needed although in the first and second years we knew that there is even a greater revenue I said stop at the first three years I do n't know what the state 's accounts can provide but I 'm not convinced that the c break up can't be done because there are no resources The hope is that the trend can finally be reversed without waiting further for the end of the emergencies affecting the planet also because in addition to the pandemic and war related emergency we risk adding a democratic emergency

#CalandriniNicola,Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President I would like to start with the last statement made by the Undersecretary when he referred in his speech to the concept that the patient must be taken over by the National Oncology Plan In our view the agenda that is being adopted today certainly goes in the right direction namely to remedy a serious deficiency in this National Plan as my previous colleagues have already said namely the lack of funds to take care of patients Certainly the approval of the agenda will not be enough to solve the problems because the government must clearly state how much and what resources it intends to allocate to make this National Oncology Plan effective The NAP we are talking about today is a good project but without time for implementation without planning and without resources it risks being a mere philosophical exercise completely insufficient for those citizens who at a delicate moment in their lives such as the fight against illness would need to know that the State is at their side On the other hand it will happen that the Regions will say that they have no own resources and the citizen will have to pay the care of his own pocket if he will have the money to be able to afford it As a political class we cannot afford to create distinctions between social classes we are called upon to intervene in order to make care a right of all and not a privilege for a few intimates We know that much more needs to be done in part we are intervening with the National Recovery and Resilience Plan as previous colleagues said which as we know affects health for almost EUR 18 billion Of these a substantial part will go to the restoration of a territorial health called proximity health with the creation of hospitals and homes of the community However what this National Recovery and Resilience Plan does not say is where we will find health medical nursing and social health workers from here to 2026 when the new structures will potentially be available This is the same principle as the National Oncology Plan many projects for the care of the sick but no clear indication of the resources allocated to the Plan itself So we risk having empty boxes and that is a shame because we cannot say that money is not there this time given the billions of euros that will come from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and also because the European plan to fight cancer to which the PON is required to align makes available EUR 4 billion But in the document sent to the Regions in recent days about which the Minister spoke a few minutes ago there is no clear indication of the resources necessary to cope with the lack of training and the shortage of staff in order to immediately activate the screenings in all the Regions including those for the taking charge of the subjects to high risk heir family as requested expressly by the National Observatory of the screenings At a time like this when the recovery of Covid 's infection seems to put the health of cancer patients at risk again it is necessary to give a signal of reversal of trend We cannot wait until 2026 with the full implementation of the National Plan to give operational responses we must act now in particular to plan on cancer screening Our hope is not to repeat the same mistake made with the National Plan which was approved in a hurry and which could be done better as far as health was concerned giving space not only to the establishment of structures but also to the formation of those who will have to manage such structures With regard to the plan we are debating today without these necessary elements particularly related to resources it will be completely useless and that is why it must be changed for the sake of those patients who struggle every day and who cannot rely only on their strength It is for all these reasons that the contribution of Brothers of Italy will not fail to this National Oncology Plan,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#ArrigoniPaolo,Arrigoni L SP PSd Az Mr President the result of the unblocking of the sale of credits is certainly not due to a single political force which has speculated on the issue of superbonus but it is the result of various political forces and in particular of the League thanks to the mediation work done by the Undersecretary Freni If it had not been for the Undersecretary Freni there would have been the red light in front not only of this amendment but also of the amendment of the League An important result has therefore been achieved allowing thousands of businesses hundreds of thousands of homeowners and tens of thousands of professionals to get out of the ford It is regrettable that within the framework of the League 's amendments package on the superbonus the proposed removal of the SAL at 30 has been rejected planned in September which would allow those who left with work on single family villas to get out of the swamp where great responsibility certainly has the Movimento 5 Stars which on the superbonus has deceived thousands and thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of citizens The League therefore strongly votes for this amendment which is certainly due also to the amendment of the League of Italy alive and of Forza Italia,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,16.42561,-12.093399,21,arrigoni l sp psd az mr president result unblocking sale credits certainly due single political force speculated issue superbonus result various political forces particular league thanks mediation work done undersecretary freni undersecretary freni would red light front amendment also amendment league important result therefore achieved allowing thousands businesses hundreds thousands homeowners tens thousands professionals get ford regrettable within framework league 's amendments package superbonus proposed removal sal 30 rejected planned september would allow left work single family villas get swamp great responsibility certainly movimento 5 stars superbonus deceived thousands thousands businesses hundreds thousands citizens league therefore strongly votes amendment certainly due also amendment league italy alive forza italia
#PazzagliniGiuliano,Mr President ladies and gentlemen of the Government colleagues from the beginning of the parliamentary term have established the practice of defining measures with a name as well as a technical designation Often in the past the pompous name is not matched by an equally important content In my opinion however this is not the case Defining this as an aid decree is entirely relevant because it contains measures of 14 billion measures in favour of our production system in favour of our population and in favour of all categories in difficulty It is no coincidence that as a first reference to content I want to talk about the fund for companies in crisis For two years there has been talk of crisis crisis for the Covid 19 crisis for the supply chain crisis of the caused by the war in Ukraine crisis caused by the dear of raw materials crisis caused by the dear oil It has been two years practically that we have been facing one crisis after another Therefore taking measures in favour of businesses could be crucial to their survival Evidence however that it is not a question of rain measures of one off aids aimed only at giving a small temporary limited comfort To expect an increase in the tax credit for the purchase of structural goods means to look to the future it means to push the enterprise and investments it means to push our productive activities to their improvement it means precisely to focus on the future to the future and not to the present survival In this respect measures for drivers also apply We know that inflation in Europe is not driven by such flourishing economic growth as in the United States for example in recent years Inflation in Europe is determined almost exclusively by expensive raw materials primarily oil and gas then aggravated by the fact that the exchange rate ratio between the euro and the dollar has gone against us This is because paying for raw materials in dollars it is clear that if the dollar strengthens against the euro raw materials cost more despite a fall in the nominal price I would like to make this observation because many people are surprised that with oil at 100 dollars per barrel fuels are still close to two euros But if when it was 110 the exchange rate was 1 to 10 and now it 's 100 but the exchange rate is 1 it 's obvious that the price is the same it 's the exact same price we paid before Therefore to implement measures in favour of road hauliers which in Italy are fundamental for our production system as practically all transport takes place on rubber means supporting not only that production category but also all Italians because in this way we help to reduce the final cost for consumers It has already been said about the 200 euro bonus which is not high of course but it is a help It has already been said of the extension granted to those who are doing the work for the superbonus for the bonus 110 percent On this point however I would like to dwell because on the occasion of my explanation of vote in this House on the conversion of the decree law bills I had complained that I could not intervene in the improvement of that provision highlighting the need to derogate also from Article 136 of the Single Construction Act in addition to the derogation contained in that decree from Article 142 The derogation from Article 136 is also contained in this measure and this is a personal satisfaction for me It is in fact a useful measure for the whole of the national territory but indispensable for the Commons earthquakeed which are very often found to fall within the limits of Article 136 and not in those of Article 142 Therefore in addition to intervening with economic support the Government also intervenes in this measure with measures in favour of what has already been done to simplify procedures to eliminate problems to give opportunities to those in a situation of difficulty In this respect the measure in favour of the municipalities also applies As a former mayor I am obviously very sensitive to everything that is in favour of the municipalities both because I believe that the mayors especially of the small municipalities are in trenches and therefore must give concrete and immediate answers citizens both because already before all these emergencies it was difficult to give these answers Now that public lighting prices have quadrupled now that heating prices have increased the municipalities obviously have many public buildings to heat now that the revenues for these municipalities have decreased it is clear that taking these measures means allowing these administrators to continue with their voluntary activity Being mayor in a small municipality I guarantee you that it is volunteering in its utmost essence,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,25.66973,-15.91081,21,mr president ladies gentlemen government colleagues beginning parliamentary term established practice defining

#PazzagliniGiuliano,"Mr President as I do often I would like to divide my speech between the things that I am satisfied with with the provisions of the measure and the things that have left me puzzled This is not with the intention of making controversy or complaining but only and exclusively with the hope of indicating a direction of indicating objectives that in my opinion it would be important to pursue in order to draw a line that leads us to the end of the legislature Given my origin obviously the first reason for satisfaction is on a solution that we will offer to the municipalities inserted in the perimeter of the seismic crater Some might mistakenly think that almost six years after the first shock the crater 's emergencies and emergencies have been overcome but that is not the case I want to go beyond the usual names known by everyone and talk about Municipalities like Ussita or like Castelsantangelo sul Nera which will probably be unknown to most but which together with the Municipality of Visso according to a calculation if I remember well made by the former head of the special office for the reconstruction of the Marche Region engineer Spuri alone represent 10 percent of the damages found in the Province of Macerata This province alone presents 65 of the damage of the Marche region and alone has twice the damage of the other three Regions put together This is to say that areas devastated by the earthquake where there are more damage than almost any other area of the crater do not yet have a crane in the old town I say this to point out that the emergency is far from over and that the needs of these areas are far from over This is why providing for the transfer of resources for the lower revenue of the waste tax Tari to these municipalities is very important Given that as I said before we are approaching the end of the parliamentary term I would like to remind not so much myself or colleagues here but also and especially those who will come after us because it is essential to continue to foresee these resources Someone naively and simplistically might think that since there are fewer people the cost of urban cleanliness service is lower But it is n't The cost could be divided into two macro- categories the variable costs obviously linked to the contribution and therefore reduced due to the minor presences and the fixed costs of the staff who do the collection rounds and the means These are costs which regardless of the quantity collected are fixed All our internal areas on average have about half of second houses and half of houses of residents There are places however with a particular touristic vocation in which this relationship is distorted I am still taking the example of Ussita if I remember correctly in Ussita there are over 2,000 second homes with a resident population of about 400 people Indicatively I think I am not far from the truth claiming that about 90 percent of the houses are second homes that contribute to the coverage of the cost of collecting solid urban waste and that therefore having been declared totally unactable at this time contribute zero to the income of the Municipality If we consider then that about half of the residents are in contribution of autonomous accommodation therefore not resident in the emergency housing solutions SAE that could contribute to the payment of the tax we get that about 5 percent of the resident population should cover in full the residual cost of the service that could be quantified in about 80 85 percent of the cost before earthquake That is why it is essential to guarantee these resources because otherwise we would bring that cost to increase by a measure that has not yet been quantified accurately by all the municipalities but that could be triple or quadruple compared to what was before the earthquake It is clear that this is not acceptable because it creates a huge inequality against those who have already been so penalized It is also not acceptable because it also goes against the always proclaimed intention of avoiding the depopulation of the internal areas favouring if possible even resettlement intention that clearly with the removal of the services and the increase of the costs we will never pursue It is true that in the mountains we are accustomed to solidarity on the contrary In fact solidarity usually provides that those who have more can give to those who have less Those who live in an already difficult situation who pay more fuel than those who live in the city who pay much more heating because not only the cost is higher but the need is for a longer period those who pay the basic necessities already more than everyone else obviously makes solidarity We know very well that more than half of the cost of fuel is of taxes so if we pay more fuel in the mountains we obviously contribute to those services which the State then reserves to us to a minimum and which benefit instead of those in other areas We are therefore accustomed to solidarity on the contrary but beyond certain limits we could not afford it If then we really want to make it easier to stay in the inland areas and to promote resettlement in those areas we need to take specific choices and solutions to achieve this objective That is why I must express regret at what is missing and this gives me the opportunity to move on to the second part of my speech especially with the aim of indicating what I think we should do to remedy problems I had tabled amendments not only on Tari but also on the possibility of derogating from Article 136 of the Cultural Heritage Code I had presented two one for all the national territory because in my opinion the inequality created between those who are subject to the constraint provided for in Article 142 and those who are subject to that provided for in Article 136 was inexcusable another on the other hand is specific for the earthquake areas The reason for this dual re-submission is because the time for the entire national territory is reduced compared to what is possible for the earthquake areas since we have granted a derogation until 2025 Therefore I was hoping that at least for the earthquake areas the amendment would be accepted since almost all the buildings of the municipalities to be rebuilt fall within the constraints of Article 136 Unfortunately this has not yet been the case but I hope that can be achieved This also allows me to close the intervention by referring to the bonus situation especially the 110 bonus which as we know has encountered many difficulties in its implementation and at this time as a resource is risking becoming a problem The title of an article this morning speaks of nearly 33,000 failed builders for 2 billion frozen bonuses banks no longer accept accrued loans and craft companies find themselves with full tax drawers but without a penny of liquidity I close pointing out that last year we might have changed a paradigm for years to highlight how important public and private works were for the recovery of the economy we talked about Marshall Plan now we could also talk about bonuses because if the exit from the economic crisis caused by lockdown was better than expectations it was also largely because interventions on Italian real estate have favored this economic growth This will be crucial for the sustainability of our debt Let 's not stop this flywheel I therefore call on the Government to resolve these difficulties immediately and to give that certainty that it should be a fundamental principle of our legal system but that it is lacking at this time",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,20.937416,-17.023924,21,"mr president often would like divide speech things

#PepePasquale,Mr President if anyone were to ask me what the aid decree is for me I would say that it is the standard act for which the Dragon Government was born and for which the majority supported it This is a measure that contains a large sum of about 20 billion in favour of Italian companies in favour of Italian families and local authorities It is practically a measure that supports Italians and Italians in the light of the difficult moment that we are living The measures were listed first in detail the bonus of 200 euros the 7 billion to contain the expensive electricity and gas bills in the third quarter of this year the 23 million euros for the dear diesel oil the liquidity to companies In short it is a measure that deserves our support a measure that makes me scream even if it is underneath nothing but free cane and easy citizenship It is a measure that Italy needs All this happens in a difficult context which still sees Italy in the grip of the pandemic for economic health and social problems a pandemic that seems not to want to abandon us and that is still threatening our country in recent weeks Then the war broke out at the gates of Europe we have an inflation that exceeds 8.5 there are the expensive bills the gas cut by Russia the loss of the purchasing power of salaries and pensions the debitory records knocking on the doors of the Italians There will be € 26 billion debitory folders € 2.6 billion has already been notified and expects a total of € 13 billion to be notified by the end of the year I would like to say a few words what does Italy need in this regard It needs another renewed convinced fiscal peace and for this reason the League and Matthew Salvini fight a fiscal peace that aims to protect not criminals and evaders but those people who unfortunately have found themselves in difficulty and have not been able to honour their debts to the Erario people who are not to be abandoned or massacred but supported because it is necessary even more at a time like this to give them a new opportunity Then we have the high prices of raw materials which also puts construction in difficulty we have the high prices of food and as if it were not enough drought has been added In this context in which all of us have been called to responsibility in which the League has renewed until last night a behavior based on responsibility and loyalty provided that it is aid to Italy provided that the nation is supported I say it not because I allow myself to judge in the house of others but it is right that Italians say it what does the Movimento 5 Stars do Run away in the face of responsibility Run in front of an important act of about 20 billion in favor of the Italians Last night we had a nightmare like me many Italians an absurd nightmare a country ours the Bel Paese was nailed for hours and hours to wait for the outcome of the national council the message of President Conte a nightmare because it reminded us of that expectation of the famous directs of two years ago of President Conte when he was to announce in a facebook non-existent decrees in a Facebook way during a pandemic in full gravity managed in the worst of ways But can Italy really continue to live waiting for those moments And then what gave birth to the consultation lasted a day An incomprehensible statement which should be translated out of respect not for us but for the Italians out of intellectual honesty towards the Italians After hours and hours of confrontation President Count says that the Movimento 5 Stars does not vote and therefore escape from the responsibilities that however is ready to support the Government and President Draghi without signing bills of exchange in white in spite of the most difficult and incomprehensible language of the First Republic Then there is even an escape forward President Conte says that the announced massive decree full bodied that President Draghi proposed by the end of July makes him happy and makes joyful the entire Movimento 5 Stars and that that same decree is due to the political action of the Movimento 5 Stars This is completely incomprehensible Today we are dealing with an important measure one of the most important of this majority and of the current Government and just a few minutes from the vote we do not know what the political force that represents the largest number of Members in this House and also in the House of Members really wants to do The moment of responsibility is not over it is in full Honesty and not that which you called with great malice but intellectual honesty towards the Italians who have given you confidence is in the fullness of his moment We do not expect to convince you or judge you that is what Italians and Italians will do but we demand to free Italy which can no longer be hostage to a bluff because the Movimento 5 Stars has turned out to be a real bluff Italy has to run Italy must return to dream and this is done in two ways either with an authoritative and solid Government or giving the word back to the Italians No more threats Enough with the palace games that look at your selfish interests and not at the general interests of the

#MalanLucio,"Mr President in order to meet the Italian companies that have been very much in serious difficulty for the Covid emergency for the highly restrictive measures sometimes of total closure established by the Government the government the latter and Parliament have approved several measures called refreshments Synthetically the conditions for having refreshments were a decrease in turnover of at least 33 percent otherwise there was nothing a maximum refreshment limit of 10 percent of the turnover to be refreshed if the company had more than 4 million turnover below this threshold you could reach up to 20 percent but in any case the amount could not exceed 150,000 euros Well these measures have proved to be largely insufficient tens of thousands of companies have failed or closed down because when you lose 100 of the receipts and many expenses remain and the state only refreshes 10 it is clear that you are forced to close and sometimes you do not close after the bankruptcy just to avoid troubleing creditors and employees and at least not to affect your personal assets Many companies on the other hand have completely failed At the same time an official of the Ministry of Transport on his own initiative but I hope the Minister is aware of things that concern billions of euros writes to the motorway dealers that they were not directly affected although certainly indirectly so because there were fewer people circulating on the streets but the highways were not closed The monopoly regime continued and while restaurants and bars had to close down the so called grills continued to operate and for the highways it was agreed with the dealers a refreshment of 100 percent even without reaching 33 percent reduction in turnover and without maximum limits That is absolutely unacceptable This money is paid with the umpteenth increase in motorway tolls that will also have to pay the companies that still in a thousand difficulties manage to get ahead including the owners of the companies that have had to close It is a clear injustice an unjustifiable thing that is added to another element only at Autostrade for Italy will be recognized a billion of compensation 452 million are already established in a document that I monster Minister because I see that shakes the head and at the same time these same benefits will affect all the motorway dealers who also have always cashed everything even when they cashed as in all previous years much more than the economic and financial plan approved also by the Government previewed",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,20.81759,-11.687766,21,"mr president order meet italian companies much serious difficulty covid emergency highly restrictive measures sometimes total closure established government government latter parliament approved several measures called refreshments synthetically conditions refreshments decrease turnover least 33 percent otherwise nothing maximum refreshment limit 10 percent turnover refreshed company 4 million turnover threshold could reach 20 percent case amount could exceed 150,000 euros well measures proved largely insufficient tens thousands companies failed closed lose 100 receipts many expenses remain state refreshes 10 clear forced close sometimes close bankruptcy avoid troubleing creditors employees least affect personal assets many companies hand completely failed time official ministry transport initiative hope minister aware things concern billions euros writes motorway dealers directly affected although certainly indirectly fewer people circulating streets highways closed monopoly regime continued restaurants bars close called grills continued operate highways agreed dealers refreshment 100 percent even without reaching 33 percent reduction turnover without maximum limits absolutely unacceptable money paid umpteenth increase motorway tolls also pay companies still thousand difficulties manage get ahead including owners companies close clear injustice unjustifiable thing added another element autostrade italy recognized billion compensation 452 million already established document monster minister see shakes head time benefits affect motorway dealers also always cashed everything even cashed previous years much economic financial plan approved also government previewed"
#MalanLucio,Minister I have seen everything over the years to defend the interests of motorway dealers at the expense of citizens and not just those who travel on motorways because we all pay the costs of motorway tolls In fact anyone who buys something knows that those goods will almost always be passed through a highway Well I have seen everything so far but the turns you have expressed in this House really go beyond any limit You mentioned Annex E but look at me as well in it it is written 542 million at the Aspi Motorways for Italy for the only months from March to June 2020 and you said that the refund is only partial He said a very partial truth in the sense that in fact his goodness the Ministry decided that if they cashed 100 less but they also spent 10 less the refund will not be 100 but will be 90 In this sense reimbursement is only partial But then I ask you Minister what is the point of the ristori decree which you also voted for because you are also in the Council of Ministers and not just in meetings with motorway dealers what is the point of setting limits for others and then exceeding these limits for those who are in huge advantage having profits that only in the traffic of cocaine are achieved and are in monopoly situations This is indeed a very serious injustice Thousands of companies have failed and the profits of international investors are being financed because Aspi now has a foreign majority and the Deposit and Loan Fund is in the minority This is absolutely unjustified and shameful I will give all the acts to the Court of Auditors and ask that the executive who has been there for twenty five years against the anti-corruption law be dismissed because it clearly acts not according to the dictates of the defence of public interests but to defend other interests,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,20.802277,-12.203155,21,minister seen everything years defend interests motorway dealers expense citizens travel motorways pay costs motorway tolls fact anyone buys something knows goods almost always passed highway well seen everything far turns expressed house really go beyond limit mentioned annex e look well written 542 million aspi motorways italy months march june 2020 said refund partial said partial truth sense fact goodness ministry decided cashed 100 less also spent 10 less refund 100 90 sense reimbursement partial ask minister point ristori decree also voted also council ministers meetings motorway dealers point setting limits others exceeding limits huge advantage profits traffic cocaine achieved monopoly situations indeed serious injustice thousands companies failed profits international investors financed aspi foreign majority deposit loan fund minority absolutely unjustified shameful give acts court auditors ask executive twenty five years anti-corruption law dismissed clearly acts according dictates defence public interests defend interests
#MalanLucio,"Mr Malan FdI Mr President I would like to thank my colleagues who with their applause encourage me to do what we should do here namely explain the reasons for our votes whether they are for or against In fact those who vote against should explain them in particular Let me turn to the content of my speech These days there is a departure from the reality of what is happening here first in the Commission on evening and then in the House this morning and this evening We learn the news that is given for the first time with the right emphasis I must say a little from all the media which tells us that in other countries restrictions obligations and all the various measures of contrast to the pandemic are suspended reduced if not cancelled in some countries they have never even had them Last summer Italy said it was like France But Italy has immediately done much worse than France by imposing much heavier restrictions those of France are lower than those of Italy and are withdrawing them it seems that they will be completely revoked at the end of next month The United Kingdom already had very limited restrictions and they are all being abolished including even quarantine for positives Denmark has abolished them although it has a higher number of infections than in Italy Sweden has never had any restrictions In the United States even the strictest states such as New York are abolishing almost all restrictions many other states have never introduced them Texas has abolished everything since March last year North Dakota and Florida have never had any restrictions Then we come here to the unreal world of Parliament and the Italian Government which introduces new more stringent more irrational more ineffective ones As Senator Zaffini recalled this morning in his speech in general discussion Italy is one of the countries with the highest mortality although it is the country that has the most serious restrictions some questions should be asked It would be enough to compare with other countries that have restrictions completely different from those of Italy such as Sweden if you go to see the curve with the various waves of contagions and deaths naturally compared to the population the trend is parallel sometimes the curve of Sweden rises before that of Italy sometimes after but the trend is the same The same thing is observed by comparing US states with opposing policies such as California and Florida such as North and South Dakota which have opposing policies among themselves but have the same pattern In the face of these measures there is a real question as to what the point is We have asked for a series of interventions from the beginning to the Government The Government has been very generous in limiting the possibility of all Italians to carry out a series of activities then there are the non-vacciners who are subjected to a series of additional restrictions frankly unjustified to a large extent But all Italians are forced even those who have the infamous green pass to spend the day taking out the certificate and being checked to carry out the activities of everyday life entering shops entering Parliament getting on trains and means of transport This is not a privilege but it is also a damage to them let 's think about how many hundreds of thousands of people do this all day that is control others This applies to companies and public institutions with a waste of money and time also for those who have all the certifications of this world What 's the reason Are the measures taken effective No Are they rational No Are they justified by a scientific foundation No Already the technical scientific committee has made them of all colors it has not right a forecast it has said everything and the opposite of everything And we learned a few nights ago that on several decisions it was kept completely in the dark But then the government comes to tell us that it has followed the indications of the technical scientific committee it is not true We are getting used to a government that is systematically lying to Parliament This was done by Minister Hope saying that he did not work with the World Health Organization to hide the scandalous absence of the pandemic plan in Italy he told us that he had not intervened and then it turned out that he had intervened This is repeated in the press conference they were shown by the numbers and a few hours away the number of non-vacciners increased by two and a half million The most incredible things happen Then we asked the Government not to exercise itself in limiting the freedom of Italian citizens as much as possible causing serious damage to the Italian economy particularly in the field of tourism the exhibition sector and everything that is the organization of events because thousands of companies close Well the state does n't do what it should We have been asking for almost two years to work for ventilation in schools and finally in this measure also thanks to our amendment we are talking about it We have called for the strengthening of the means of transport but it has not been done We have asked for serious interventions on timely therapies for all other diseases because it is always said that it is better to prevent than to cure but it is also said that action must be taken promptly Compared to Covid who he does not fail to remember has killed 150,000 people instead it can be expected So if Italy has a higher mortality rate than other countries something has obviously been wrong The watchful expectation which in many cases was unanticipated cost death just as it cost the dead to have prevented as Minister Hope did even if not formally forbidding them but putting many obstacles from doing autopsies at the beginning of the pandemic Evidently for a long time therapies have not been able to take into account a foundation of medical science for centuries autopsies to understand what had happened in the bodies of those who had died It was n't done We have constantly inconsistent measures with contrasts and contradictions We have tabled an amendment in the Commission it was rejected having voted in favour only of the Brothers of Italy which called for a very Europeanist thing namely that the Italians had the same rights as the citizens of other European countries but even outside Europe It should be remembered that those who have done the two doses for more than six months if they are Italian have lost their green pass so they can no longer do anything they cannot work for many categories of people they cannot go to shops trains and so on if they are foreign they can do so for another three months Does that make sense Where 's the rationality Where 's the international profile There are other incredible contradictions non-vaccined blood donors are even urged as are all and of course also vaccinated to donate blood So what 's the point that there 's no problem if they inject into my veins the blood of an unvaccined person but that same person can't get on my own train because who knows what he 's up to after doing the swab and therefore proving that he 's not contagious Well in the face of this we are voting against this measure and we are asking that the green pass be abolished and that what is needed by Italians is done the therapies the aeration of schools a work of information and not propaganda because propaganda it is not information has led skepticism in many Italians obtaining the opposite result the Italians are not being taken for fools

#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President on Tuesday during the debate on this measure in the presence of the Deputy Minister for Infrastructure I mentioned the fact which I pointed out several times in the questions that there is a senior manager of the Ministry of Infrastructure whose name I am now saying Happy Morisco since it has already been done also by the Vice Minister who for twenty five years at the Ministry or equivalent structures deals with motorway concessions This is clearly contrary to the rotation provided for by the anti-corruption law moreover it has recently signed documents that constitute immense gifts worth billions or otherwise hundreds of millions in favour of motorway dealers This is precisely the condition that anti-corruption law is meant to avoid Deputy Minister Bellanova replied that the position of summit regarding motorway concessions has changed over the years Yeah but I did n't say that I had said that that individual person is signing documents that make huge gifts to motorway dealers for example by granting them 100 percent refreshment from even minimum reductions in turnover in the Covid period while all other companies have at most 10 percent refreshment or 20 percent in some cases I have also stressed the fact that this person has been in that position for twenty five years as can be seen from the curriculum vitae he himself evidently compiled which states that from 1997 to 2011 he has carried out the activity of evaluating the feasibility of the financial plans related to the motorway concessions while in the period 2011 2012 he was manager at the economic and financial analysis unit carrying out activities related to the supervision of the motorway concessions and so on until he is the maximum manager on the motorway concessions Deputy Minister Bellanova also said that if there are questions it will be the Government 's duty to answer them There have been questions for years and the Government is opposed to what Vice President Bellanova herself rightly said to be a specific duty In order not to make a very boring list of numbers I will hand over the list of main questions that have no answer not least because to list them all would go beyond the times that you Mr President are kindly granting me,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,20.49161,-12.899537,21,mr malan fdi mr president tuesday debate measure presence deputy minister infrastructure mentioned fact pointed several times questions senior manager ministry infrastructure whose name saying happy morisco since already done also vice minister twenty five years ministry equivalent structures deals motorway concessions clearly contrary rotation provided anti-corruption law moreover recently signed documents constitute immense gifts worth billions otherwise hundreds millions favour motorway dealers precisely condition anti-corruption law meant avoid deputy minister bellanova replied position summit regarding motorway concessions changed years yeah n't say said individual person signing documents make huge gifts motorway dealers example granting 100 percent refreshment even minimum reductions turnover covid period companies 10 percent refreshment 20 percent cases also stressed fact person position twenty five years seen curriculum vitae evidently compiled states 1997 2011 carried activity evaluating feasibility financial plans related motorway concessions period 2011 2012 manager economic financial analysis unit carrying activities related supervision motorway concessions maximum manager motorway concessions deputy minister bellanova also said questions government 's duty answer questions years government opposed vice president bellanova rightly said specific duty order make boring list numbers hand list main questions answer least list would go beyond times mr president kindly granting
#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President I rise to ask the answer to a series of questions on the issue of Motorways for Italy a business promoted by environments of the Ministry of Infrastructure then variously called which involves a theft to the detriment of motorists and all those who use the highways and therefore practically of all because the goods we buy in the shops pass in great part through the highways and that will instead benefit the managers of the highways that have had such a disastrous management to see the collapse of the Morandi bridge The specific responsibilities of that disaster are being investigated by the judiciary but the lack of maintenance is evident and proven then the bridge may have collapsed unfortunately but it is in fact that on the tolls of the highways will be loaded at least eight billion more than the largest of the figures that could be imagined to give to Mr Benetton and to Atlantia As if that were not enough while doing that at the Ministry without the authorization of anyone of a paragraph of an agenda it was decided to refund to Autostrade for Italy 100 percent of the difference of receipts that there was in 2019 compared to the receipts of 2020 And this for Covid when hundreds of thousands of Italian companies have been reimbursed 2 5 10 0 percent and even late being in many cases forced to close Is it possible that for the first three months only more than 500 million are to be taken away from the Italians when hundreds of thousands of companies have closed down or are in serious difficulty because they have received virtually no restaurants We 're talking about companies that have n't had less receipts like highways but they 've had zero receipts in fact they 've only had the expenses because when a restaurant forbids to open it 's not that it can arrange to cash in anyway On the other hand the highways continued to collect and on the whole collected more than was laid down in the financial plans This has been deliberately ignored by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport now sustainable mobility without answering questions This is indeed an insult to Parliament and to the Italians However not answering questions is wrong and I expect that there will be action by the Senate because answering questions is not a faculty or a courtesy but a simple act of compliance with the Rules of Procedure Not only is there no answer to the uncomfortable questions but there is an operation of tens of billions without even informing the Senate this really is an insult to Parliament the Senate and the Italians,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,20.751099,-12.20576,21,mr malan fdi mr president rise ask answer series questions issue motorways italy business promoted environments ministry infrastructure variously called involves theft detriment motorists use highways therefore practically goods buy shops pass great part highways instead benefit managers highways disastrous management see collapse morandi bridge specific responsibilities disaster investigated judiciary lack maintenance evident proven bridge may collapsed unfortunately fact tolls highways loaded least eight billion largest figures could imagined give mr benetton atlantia enough ministry without authorization anyone paragraph agenda decided refund autostrade italy 100 percent difference receipts 2019 compared receipts 2020 covid hundreds thousands italian companies reimbursed 2 5 10 0 percent even late many cases forced close possible first three months 500 million taken away italians hundreds thousands companies closed serious difficulty received virtually restaurants 're talking companies n't less receipts like highways 've zero receipts fact 've expenses restaurant forbids open 's arrange cash anyway hand highways continued collect whole collected laid financial plans deliberately ignored ministry infrastructure transport sustainable mobility without answering questions indeed insult parliament italians however answering questions wrong expect action senate answering questions faculty courtesy simple act compliance rules procedure answer uncomfortable questions operation tens billions without even informing senate really insult parliament senate italians
#CanduraMassimo,CANDURA L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to greet you and all my fellow Members First of all when talking about Armed Forces the first thought is the expression of gratitude to what women and men in uniform are doing for the country to what they have done and to everything they will do That 's my first thought With regard to the measure under consideration I think of the first mission of the armed forces the protection of the life and freedom of citizens within the borders of the nation We had a very recent example of this the engagement of the armed forces during the pandemic not only for the function of public order but above all for the support of military health to civil health at that time especially in 2020 of great fear and great uncertainty for the whole country and for all our fellow citizens It is no coincidence that Article 9 of the measure explicitly mentions a strengthening of military health personnel The need for this measure as already mentioned by the President derives from a law n. 244 of 2012 which was inserted in a context austerity and linear cuts which did not only damage the armed forces but also to health If in 2020 Italy faced the health emergency I do not say with difficulty but certainly with great effort with an Italian health care fatigued this is due to the legacy of reckless linear cuts required by a mentality of economic policy that I personally did not share then and I still do not share The law of parliamentary initiative is coming and I would like to thank my colleague Mr Ferrari one of the first signatories to the Chamber of Deputies for this and I would like to thank Parliament not only our Commission and the President but the whole Parliament in its two Chambers because I would like to remind you that this measure is coming from Parliament It comes from Parliament because it is a necessity of the country to strengthen the instrument of defence I will not repeat what many colleagues have said very well but I would like to remind everyone of the need to think of the Armed Forces as an investment to avoid future losses just like for health they are investments that are made to protect our citizens On the other hand considering the chronicle and the historical period that we are living in I think that this is clear even to the most closed minded people let 's say on this front Clearly I advance the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Group Partito Sardo d'Azione on this measure and take the opportunity to thank all the members of the Defence Commission President Donatella Tesei Laura Garavini Daniela Donno and our current President Roberta Pinotti because if we worked in harmony as already mentioned in some intervention this did not rain from heaven but it depended on the sensitivity of those who led the Commission from our Donatella Tesei to Senator Pinotti and also on the sensitivity of those who were members of it It was a very interesting experience for me too Vice President at the first legislature I hope a vote in favour and convinced of this measure it is in the interest of the country and is only the starting point The next item is the G9.1 first by Senator Gasparri who also bears my signature has already been presented and is a perspective We do not stop at this we invite the Government to be guardian of this measure and the next Parliament to improve the situation and invest I repeat in the armed forces as a means of protecting our country,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#AugussoriLuigi,Mr President I am satisfied with the Minister 's reply because he has clearly focused the problem he has explained to us what the problems are and he has also proposed possible solutions It is clear that health surveillance as he acknowledged cannot be the solution at least because not all workers can be used as smart working therefore there are categories that in case of necessity have the need to take advantage of the absence from the service The measure has a cost which we estimated in about 70 million for the three months but could also be higher It 's a problem but it can't be the problem In these two years we have found resources for everyone rightly and dutylessly from restaurateurs to ski resorts we have spent billions and you members of the government know this better than we parliamentarians It is absurd not to be able to find 70 million even 80 90 or 100 for the most fragile and weak people I invite you during the conversion of the decree law reopening that is under consideration by the House to accept the amendment that restores the protections of Article 26 and not those of the list of superragiles that as you know is not enough because it excludes too many people The invitation I make to you and your colleagues is to prove that you are a civilized country worrying first of all of the weakest,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,18.059473,-19.34838,21,mr president satisfied minister 's reply clearly focused problem explained us problems also proposed possible solutions clear health surveillance acknowledged cannot solution least workers used smart working therefore categories case necessity need take advantage absence service measure cost estimated 70 million three months could also higher 's problem can't problem two years found resources everyone rightly dutylessly restaurateurs ski resorts spent billions members government know better parliamentarians absurd able find 70 million even 80 90 100 fragile weak people invite conversion decree law reopening consideration house accept amendment restores protections article 26 list superragiles know enough excludes many people invitation make colleagues prove civilized country worrying first weakest

#ZaffiniFrancesco,Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President in spite of the appearances this is a very important measure it concerns the reorganization and the new financing criteria of an important part of our health care of our National Health Service both that provided by public facilities and that in the case of IRCCS which is moreover the majority provided by private facilities In our country there are 51 institutions of hospitalization and scientific care 31 are so called private ones among which there are centres of excellence such as St. Raffaele the Child Jesus talking about individuals in this case is obviously a euphemism and 20 are public referring directly to the National Health Service We have examined this text carefully and to be honest Mr Sileri we were more concerned about it a few months ago when we read it and followed the work in the other branch of Parliament What happened reassures us in part since the delegation law will probably fall to the center right which will also be called to govern the fate of national health care So from this point of view we 're a little less concerned but of course we 're all begging But what is the point of this reasoning The basic idea of the establishment of these centres of assistance and research was the translation of knowledge between research and assistance it seems a banality but nobody tells us even today what is the result achieved after almost forty years by the law and after twenty years by the most substantial reform of 2003 What are the results and results of the copious resources addressed to these scientific institutions defined as IRCCS in terms of assistance and for example of impact factor for research How much have these institutions been enriched in terms of innovation baggage innovative networks and ability to adhere to care and care needs compared to the resources addressed This money my colleague Sileri has it been spent or invested This is the issue that is missing in the text One cannot but start from an analysis of what has happened over the last twenty thirty or forty years in order to act in terms of the reorganization of these institutions Moreover we know that everything fits as the President of our Commission has rightly pointed out in a framework of reordering of the PNRR mission 6 so in the big issue of reordering territorial assistance but also of the hospital so all this remains to be done I repeat that we would have been 100 concerned we care about 50 but it remains a incomplete text from this point of view Let me give you an example to understand and to clarify many of these IRCCS have peripheral locations which have obviously led to an area of spending centres Have they served Can we confirm them all I have some doubts about that I would like to understand what the budget for these years is One way of clarifying to Parliament what is happening with regard to this important piece of national health care would for example be a regular report detailing with anticipation what is happening because it is obvious that these institutions receive resources through the regions by contract private IRCCS by convention public IRCCS but they are still paid for in performance How were these performances It is a doubt that remains and will remain I fear for some more time Having said that the text as a whole is normal also thanks to the agendas on which it has been given a favourable opinion I would like to thank Mrs Binetti as rapporteur for the text for being always precise and precise as I have seen in our four years of attendance at the Commission We will therefore vote in favour because we have no particular reason to distinguish ourselves from the vote on this measure but with a final wish which echoes the controversy that Mr Parente rightly referred to We have a huge amount of money for health care through a thousand channels one of which is IRCCS If there is no detailed and precise logic of evaluating these expenses so that the investment content can be determined rather than spending then it is clear that the Regions are right a thousand times when they claim even today that they have not been reimbursed of the greater expenses incurred and documented according to the instructions received from the Ministry regarding the various waves of Covid This is very serious ladies and gentlemen because the regions have faced it with their own resources sometimes with important reserves there are some let us think of the larger ones which have allocated abundant reserves to the need to balance the higher Covid costs The State must intervene on these and cannot refer them to the Regions because they all go into disarray on this road This is a serious serious problem There is another serious problem ladies and gentlemen do you know that the National Health Fund is not yet allocated directed and agreed as the law provides The regions have not yet given the green light to the National Health Fund because they clearly and rightly call for greater attention for example to higher energy costs Think how much more a hospital can cost for a thousand beds and see that there are so many around Italy well here can not be worth the logic and the game of the cerino to who remains in the hand In the past few days we had started a cognitive survey with the Health and Health Commission and we first listened to the head of the Ministry of Economics and Finance assigned to the National Health Fund but there were no answers to this If up to now there has been a deficit of sensitivity denounced not later than today by President Fedriga towards the need to allocate resources having good attention to their concrete results and results of these resources also of IRCCS this is the theme that will engage the next majority the next Government and the next parliamentarians who will sit among these scranni and that will deal with health I would like to hope that this greater sensitivity will be widely shared

#ZaffiniFrancesco,"Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President this is the first time in this parliamentary term that I have asked you to speak on matters not included on the agenda because I am forced to ask through this medium for an answer to a question that I had first signed which we presented to the Government last February on a relevant circumstance such as the deaths from Covid This is an issue on which a Commission of Inquiry should have been committed if they had allowed us to set it up because all the European Parliaments have made available to their citizens parliamentary committees of inquiry that shed light on the many aspects of the pandemic and the emergency that has come about but not Italy There are regions that have set up committees of inquiry in Italy but Parliament does not because there is an emergency this is the reason why a parliamentary committee of inquiry cannot be set up Well the citizens will judge about it One of the first issues that a hypothetical Commission of Inquiry should have faced is the excess of mortality in our country compared to the European panorama our deaths for Covid are the most numerous On the other hand Mr President our measures to contain freedoms with the consequent economic deaths are the ones that have killed the national economy the most because our GDP is the one that has suffered the greatest reduction On these two figures President we have questioned Minister Hope and we would like to have an answer since it is precisely on the Republic that an article has been published that quotes a report by The Lancet which compared to health issues is a sort of Gospel based on a world study that punctually analyzes the deaths for Covid from all over the world and notes that in Italy compared to those registered that are over 160,000 there would be 120,000 more I do n't know what the truth is I do n't even want to imagine it but I want our Minister of Health to tell me by responding to the inspection union act 3-03124 presented at session 407 of 23 February 2022",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,15.375199,-17.552122,21,"mr zaffini fdi mr president first time parliamentary term asked speak matters included agenda forced ask medium answer question first signed presented government last february relevant circumstance deaths covid issue commission inquiry committed allowed us set european parliaments made available citizens parliamentary committees inquiry shed light many aspects pandemic emergency come italy regions set committees inquiry italy parliament emergency reason parliamentary committee inquiry cannot set well citizens judge one first issues hypothetical commission inquiry faced excess mortality country compared european panorama deaths covid numerous hand mr president measures contain freedoms consequent economic deaths ones killed national economy gdp one suffered greatest reduction two figures president questioned minister hope would like answer since precisely republic article published quotes report lancet compared health issues sort gospel based world study punctually analyzes deaths covid world notes italy compared registered 160,000 would 120,000 n't know truth n't even want imagine want minister health tell responding inspection union act 3-03124 presented session 407 23 february 2022"
#ZaffiniFrancesco,Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President the Brothers of Italy Group will vote in favour of this measure when we examine it Sometimes it happens that colleagues put forward the vote in favour for example by adding convincingly We can say that we will vote for the measure serenely in the sense that although it represents the first step of a path certainly necessary and indeed absolutely essential we do not consider it an exhaustive measure or in any case able to counter the problem of corruption in health transactions in itself Money inside health care is a lot a lot On average the regions allocate between 70 and 80 of their budget to health Having passed on health or a large part of the health sector to them was certainly a positive measure because it differentiated the risk and divided it Leaving the enormous mass of money in health care to a single subject evidently as the history of the first Republic taught us was a huge problem by dividing it on all the regions we at least divided the mountain at risk of corruption of capital destined for health In order to give colleagues an idea of what we are talking about I would like to point out that in 2020 the data on corruption reported by the main national newspapers showed the health sector in second place That is to say that about 17.33 percent of the corruption reported by the Italian media occurred in the health sector This is about 117 cases It is evident that the figure is approximated by default as it is the cases of corruption that have come to know and thus discovered Compared to this figure it is the submerged one that worries us Corruption in health care is as widespread as it is more dangerous because it harms the citizen as well as the state 's coffers It damages it by leading to poor treatment endless waiting lists doctors who use devices chosen not for their quality but for the profit they can make more or less legitimately more or less transparently We also think of the welfare paths even influenced by the possible economic gain Colleagues it is useless to deny that the public dimension of health certainly does not protect you for example from the incursions of big pharmas or in any case suppliers of drugs devices computer aids and programs A whole world that clings to the national health system and draws life from it The Covid did not simplify the theme indeed if possible it got worse because it increased the lifeblood and the destinations of money to health care widening the field to possible incursions and corruptions A group of researchers committed to facilitating access to data to improve transparency in health care estimated that in the three years 2017 2019 the funding allocated in a transparent way by the main pharmaceutical companies amounted to about one billion euros all this in the form of donations refreshment of travel expenses compensation for advice organization of events hospital garrisons and research centers This enormous amount of money I repeat is transparent and is also clearly inferior to reality as it is certainly approximated by default gives the idea of how much it is necessary to make as transparent as possible what happens in the relationships involving financial disbursements in health care The text of the measure before us which has some shadows but which is generally in favour of us so much so that we as I said will peacefully vote for its approval given certain rules of knowledge assuming that what is transparent is in itself legitimate All right since we have done so in many other areas such as for example with political foundations with banking relations with the famous transparency in financial transactions Precisely because there are these precedents we have seen however that the mere fact of the knowledge and publication on a website or on a Facebook page of transactions that pertain to financial movements in health care does not in itself lead to a solution What we are doing with this measure is an important first step There was a gap and it was appropriate to fill it but now it is clear that further system reforms are needed because unfortunately there is no other way to force operators in the sector to have a substantial not by chance correct use of this adjective The only way that we are given is to eliminate the laces and laces so defined by someone before me of the rules of the market that is making the transactions available to everyone as much as possible therefore widening the lists of the suppliers with thousand other possible measures leaving to the market

#MarinRaffaellaFiormaria,MARIN L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to thank Senator Binetti for having expressed her support for the adoption of all the agendas showing a great cooperative spirit but also a great deal of sensitivity to all the issues that have been presented For the quality of the services the institutes of hospitalization and scientific care IRCCS are characterized as poles of excellence and reference centers for research activities performing hospitalization and care services of high specialty and represent a dynamic tool for the promotion development and application of innovative technologies and therapies in the field of health and biomedical It therefore seems appropriate to integrate IRCCS research activity with that on emerging and devastating diseases with functional cognitive decay which is a theme that has always been part of the themes of the League and which is particularly recurring in my personal choices in parliamentary activity and beyond It is desirable to encourage the integration of the same in the network of territorial structures becoming a reference of high specialization and support for the care and treatment of psychiatric diseases including through the adoption of models that provide an integrated multidisciplinary approach in order to build extraordinary plans of intervention aimed to implement permanently the health and social assistance services for persons suffering from mental disorders as well as to ensure in compliance with the constitutional principles referred to in Article 32 of the Constitution and especially in compliance with the legislation of other European States full access to care for patients and patients suffering from a mental disorder who choose to undergo voluntary health treatment TSV This is in order to ensure the taking in care and continuous care of the patient with critical and severe psychic disorder for which it is not objectively predictable to discharge from the hospital in the short term to prevent relapses promote stabilisation and circumvent mandatory health treatment TSO According to data provided by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD in its focus on Cutting down mental health severe depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia and other serious mental diseases reduce life expectancy by an average of twenty years compared to the general population similar to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases 5 percent of the world 's working age population has severe mental illness and an additional 15 percent suffer from a more common form This naturally reduces employment and productivity prospects and wages Direct and indirect costs according to OECD statistics may exceed 4 of gross domestic product In Italy 17 million people suffer from mental illness Moreover Italy is in the twentieth place in Europe as a number of psychiatrists working in the public sector and we are at the last place for the number of beds The reform of IRCCS is one of the actions identified in the PNRR to improve the country 's structural situation and is an integral part of the recovery that is also intended to be activated through European resources In addition as can be seen from the Update Note to the 2021 Economy and Finance Document it is a tool linked to the 2022 2024 budget maneuver On behalf of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione party I voted in favour and conclude with a quote A fundamental role for the support of people with mental illness continues to be played by families often

#RufaGianfranco,"Mr President before I begin my speech I feel obliged to express in this House my closeness to the Ukrainian people and hope that they will smile again free in a free nation Colleagues it certainly must not be the infringement procedure by the European Commission that requires us to review the rules on public contracts but the common sense of politics and above all respect for the work of Italian companies The league has the heart of the work and all the administrative machinery linked to them and the proof is the amendments tabled and also approved which promote a change of pace with a reorganization of the sector more timely and organic starting first of all from the legislation The Commission 's text lays the foundations for a new law on more streamlined and even more balanced public contracts The League has enriched the law with a series of amendments that have as principle the respect of the sacrifice and the risk of the enterprise I am thinking for example of the amendment for the protection of Made in Italy in supplies of the amendment for the repentance of costs in case of controlled increases see today the increase of raw materials and the cost of energy I am still thinking of the amendment which also gives small businesses the opportunity to participate in large contracts because they are divided into small lots The League thus grows small territorial enterprises and speeds up the work of the big ones The amendments of the League provide for the simplification of the rules that constitute the professional wrongdoing and the identification of the real causes that determine the exclusion from the notices therefore clear and concrete answers of support This is not only due to discipline in line with the directives that have been required for some time or to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development but above all to ensure that activities can be organised for material and administrative investments The proposed amendments aim to encourage good and rapid implementation of the work including by means of sanctioning or rewarding mechanisms In fact rules are needed to avoid unfinished works such as 410 works by 2020 with a value of more than 2.5 billion In this regard the League 's agenda for the digitisation of the Italian construction and public administrations sector is well worthwhile also in the interests of rapid monitoring and monitoring The League presented and structured an amendment in the delegation to the Government to limit the use of the draw because we believe it is right to reward professionalism With Amendment 1,155 we wanted insurance policies to be provided for by the contracting authority With the agenda already Amendment 1.81 we recognize the decisive role of the professionals involved in the participation in races With amendment 1.247 text 2 we intervene in the objective and social value of the collective catering service It has the value of nourishing and educating children the elderly and the sick and rewarding the quality of the offer with criteria that enhance the food supply policies and recommend criteria that reward the planning of communication and information with a prevention of waste and a sustainability of the meals also verify the socio- economic reliability and the certifications and also determine the exclusion from the contracts of the collective catering of an improvised catering We have structured the amendment that enhances the professional experience gained over the years by technical directors once again giving priority to meritocracy and professionalism The work of the and in the Commission to which thanks go for the fruitful and constructive commitment beginning with the offices colleagues rapporteurs in particular Senator Pergreffi and the Government with the constant and constructive presence of the Senator Deputy Minister Bellanova I hope he will find effective delegation to the Government because the commitment has structured a series of amendments that will create synthesis for good rules of public contracts As well as for this law delegation the League is to the Government for the good of companies and its professionals If we were not in the government we would only have hypothesized without bringing to compliment ideas and requests able to give answers certainties and programming For

#LaPietraPatrizioGiacomo,"THE PIETRA FdI Mr President I would like to bring to the attention of the House the content of this amendment and to make the Government well appreciate the opinion it has expressed because I do not believe that this proposal can be expressed against it Amendment 20,200 aims to protect the fundamental values of the Italian transfusion system and explicitly provides that blood collection should be carried out exclusively by unpaid and unpaid donors I think this is a battle of civilization The Italian transfusion system is an excellence and must be protected blood plasma and plasma derivatives are themes not known to the public but fundamental for the maintenance of the National Health System and for the health of many patients It is therefore the task of politics and this House to safeguard and defend this model which is based on two principles gratuitousness and voluntaryness I would like to highlight a figure that emerged from the annual research of the Italian Blood Volunteers Association AVIS The pandemic and the emergency situation in our country have generated a boost to donation once again therefore the Italian system confirms itself as a virtuous model in the consolidation and expansion of the audience of donors We must therefore work on structural interventions that increase the volume of blood donors not with premiums but with active policies such as increasing the number of health workers extending the opening hours of the centres the inclusion of blood collection centres in community homes and the reorganization and renewal of plasma storage and separation machinery The collection of blood therefore excludes and must exclude at the origin any kind of economic and financial assessment Commercializing one 's own blood is tantamount to commercializing organs or any other part of the body The considerations are in the deepest ethics of mankind there is a bulwark made up precisely of gratuitousness and voluntariness this amendment asks this to the Assembly which once passed can open the way to a thousand other drifts and considerations The Italian model I repeat and finish shows that self sufficiency can be achieved through a totally free collection system Government and Parliament must work together to support plasma collection with policies necessary to achieve self sufficiency in research not by marketing plasma Defending the Italian transfusion system is the only way to protect the National Health System lowering as much as possible the public cost of plasma for purchasing from abroad Today we begin with a small step drawing on the deepest morale and tomorrow we can decide to buy or sell any part of our body With this amendment Brothers of Italy stands as defender of this bulwark of civilization Blood is not an economic tool and you do not want to open up to easily predictable drifts I still ask the House and the Government to review their position on this

#BergesioGiorgioMaria,"Mr President after Decree Law No 17 of 2022 on energy with which we have allocated EUR 6.7 billion in resources here is an important measure Decree Law No 21 on Ukraine with an initial budget of EUR 3.6 billion and following the Government 's amendment adding an additional EUR 2.3 billion for a total of almost EUR 6 billion This is a measure which contains important measures in addition to the Presidency of the Council there are nine ministries involved to adequately support the Italian system the reduction of oil and petrol prices the reduction of excise duties the fuel bonus for employees the tax credit for companies the social bonus on electricity and gas There are important issues such as the installment of bills the transfer of tax credits wage integration measures to support road haulage agriculture fisheries tourism and all public bodies On the subject of agriculture the measure introduces in Article 19 an important novelty in the field of aid and support to the sector financing the renegotiation or restructuring of agricultural loans an aspect that affects many of the more than 720,000 agricultural enterprises active in our country that will be able to count on an intervention under guarantee up to 5 million euros The fund was refinanced for 20 million euros by Ismea and there was also a shared amendment of the Ministry of Agriculture Food and Forestry Policy that had made available an additional 80 million euros on which however there was no positive feedback from the General Accounting of the State However we have the reasonable certainty reading the drafts that the fund will be refinanced in the aid decree- law already approved in the Council of Ministers for an additional EUR 100 million so as to bring a total guarantee that exceeds almost EUR 2 billion only for the agricultural sector and this becomes important This article aimed at generating greater liquidity for businesses has been made an important modification which comes after years of absurd battles and judgments not always corrected on the subject refunds from fines deriving from milk quotas In Italy in 2021 we imported about 621,000 tons of milk the comparison between production and consumption is at 88 percent We grew up until 2018 it was 78 percent 10 percent more but still 12 percent missing So why despite the growth in this sector which is increasing in quantity and quality are there many farmers still in dispute over the payment of milk quota fines With our amendment to Article 21 which implements the reopening of the time limits for the payment of these fines we provide a clear indication to the thousands of producers involved and close a dark page of our country 's livestock history which has seen the imposition of limits on milk production by the European Union without taking into account how our production has always been less than consumption requirements in Italy Our amendment allows for the reopening of the time limits for sixty days thus activating the co-active collection phase by the Revenue Agency giving companies the opportunity to adhere to the installment that they could have benefited from in the first debiting phase This would cover more than 3,000 companies not a few for a total amount of more than 800 million euros on the one hand it would allow debtors to pay their damages without facing a co-active collection procedure also allowing them to access the benefits of public administration and on the other hand the administration to increase the level of recovery without bearing the burdens of enforcement procedures Therefore this amendment bringing debt restructuring to twenty five years generates liquidity to address this issue bearing in mind that those who have fines that exceed 300,000 euros can install them in twenty or thirty years with a single annual payment We considered it as a League that it was necessary to combine the indications coming from Europe without denying the excesses when necessary with the demands of the Italian producers Another important issue for us is climate change The decrease of 35 percent in rainfall on most of our peninsula hits with the entry into force from 1 January 2022 of the legislation on ecological outflow which replaces the one in place at 31 December 2021 on the minimum vital outflow The theme of the releases in the beehive in the summer period becomes fundamental in order to be able to implement the agricultural crops as foreseen by the modification on the land at rest of the CAP for about 200,000 hectares more for our country We approved a resolution from the Agriculture Commission in this House on 26 April last and I thank my colleagues in order to ask for an extension of the entry into force of this restrictive measure As the Lega Group we tabled an amendment to Article 21 to ensure that the resolution passed to a binding rule that could enter into force before the summer period which is also very dear to our agriculture The amendment was endorsed by the Commission The delicate geopolitical moment we are experiencing requires measures to deal with the economic effects of the international crisis in progress taking into account the agri food needs especially production Trials are therefore important but it must not enter into force by 2025 because it will certainly create problems for our agriculture Other measures have been introduced on this issue including some important also for the pig chain for the reduction of costs to implement the draft legislative decree on unfair practices We are witnessing strong tensions in the commodity market dictated above all by the role that uncertainty generates in relation to food supply scenarios The extraordinary peak in raw material prices has also worsened the living conditions of the weakest sections of the world 's population limiting their access to indispensable resources such as food and energy The surge in prices over this last period has been the highest in recent decades due to intensity and duration Think that the peak reached in the first quarter 2022 is higher than the peaks 2007 2008 and also at the level reached in the seventies of the last century in the midst of the oil crisis One of the points to highlight is that there is an almost identical trend between cereals oil and sugar so uncertainty reigns over all commodities This uncertainty affects farms and leads them to have to think more broadly and also in a different way in a more efficient and effective way The primary sector must immediately familiarise itself with new and mutual financial instruments in order to gain access to income stability which becomes fundamental We must not waste any more time to intervene both on simplifications and on support to give certain answers to a supply chain such as agri-food that certainly in the light of the strategic role it plays for the country 's economy deserves immediate and concrete answers

abolition of the super green pass and because we find ourselves once again in the government 's umpteenth request for confidence Brothers of Italy is for no to trust this Government but I would like to motivate it We are opposed because the Government has demonstrated its inability to manage the pandemic also because we must say it clearly we see that all the data comfort us from this point of view We have seen the decline in contagions the decline in intensive therapies by now it is clearly below 10 percent the decline in hospitalizations in the Covid departments So we can't understand why you still want to continue on the road to the super green pass Instead you should note rather than the narrative and the story that this majority makes to the Italians that the management of the pandemic has not been successful I say this with great regret Unfortunately Italy as the official data say because it is not that said Brothers of Italy is among the first countries in Europe and in the world both by mortality and by the lethality of the coronavirus This should make everyone understand that as we say perhaps there have been errors in management I do not want to talk about how much money has been taken away from public health over the years it is over 37 billion If on the other hand these investments had occurred the management of this pandemic could have produced completely different results But let 's come today The data tell us that Italians have been extraordinary in getting vaccinated despite all the confusion even from the point of view of communication that this Government has done on vaccines I think you all remember what happened with some vaccines first over fifty then over sixty then over forty surely creating confusion fear doubts and questions from Italians Despite all this however despite the government 's inability to manage communication and information with Italian citizens today we can say that Italians have been extraordinary because over 90 percent is now vaccinated The government then should note that those who wanted to immunize themselves have been vaccinated and those who did not do it today we do not believe that it can change their mind maybe a small part will do it but not so much as to substantially change the numbers of the vaccinated I remember here too the confusion made by the government giving the data on the famous cover that we had to have to make sure that the virus circulated less among the Italians Here too however these data have now completely disappeared Why then continue with the super green pass Why continue in addition to denouncing what is a fundamental principle of our Constitutional Charter which in the first article states that the Italian Republic is based on work Why continue complaining not only about the Constitutional Charter but also about what has been done which could have been done with swabs before Among our amendments which of course were rejected there was precisely the request for salivary swabs Instead today you decide that the over 50 cannot work they cannot therefore receive a salary they cannot give continuity to their family because you take away their salary It is a very serious thing moreover at a time like this really dramatic for families with the increase in the cost of light and gas with the inflation that is coming in a very heavy way in a cross-cutting way that will then hit everyone And you continue in this decision to take off the job to take the pay off the over 50 workers I am a little grounded because I thought that the union which in Italy at least in words has always filled its mouth with the defense of the workers had something to say instead it is silent shut up The left which has always filled the mouth of being on the workers side will once again vote in favour of this measure today in this House But especially with the acts you contradict each other between what you vote and what you want I would like to take you back in fact to the time when we elected the President of the Republic and all of us were asked regardless of having all three doses of vaccine the first the second and the booster to do the swab And we were asked the same morning because it had to be not only a third generation buffer but also done in the last few hours We had to take a swab because otherwise none of us could have had access to the election of the President of the Republic He denies you on his own Do things and then implement others How do you feel in front of the Italians when the swab goes well for you beyond the vaccines That morning I did n't understand why even though I had all three vaccines I had to take a swab There is something in your facts and narration that does not come back and see that time is a gentleman from this point of view For the truth will come out and you will be disproved by the facts Why do you keep not thinking about those families where maybe there is only one person who brings home the salary and who will not be able to put together lunch with dinner for their children Despite the data that you all know and that I have reminded you continue to make mistakes Brothers of Italy cannot be there not because we are against vaccines I want to say it clearly Not only does one person speak of course who did all three doses of vaccine but I also remember that we have always said that vaccines were absolutely fundamental in the fight against Coronavirus because they saved from the cemetery and hospital certainly not from the contagion I do n't even want to remember when on July 22nd last year the President of the Council Draghi in a press conference told all Italians that the green pass gave the security to attend safe places because it was not possible to contagion How many lies how many things have you told that they were not right that science has denied Afterwards long after what we said we certainly did not want to replace doctors we were right because the vaccine does not exclude from contagion It is true and I say it forcefully that excludes serious illness And so today we take note of the Government 's will to continue to make mistakes we also take note once again that you put trust I remember when some Members of the Movimento 5 Stars said that Parliament 's role had to be absolutely central Once again however you will vote for the confidence of a government that is being trampled on by Parliament which does not enable us all to do our work in the Commissions and by tabling amendments Nothing all this does not apply to you and then very often your mouths are filled with a word called democracy,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,15.391634,-15.99347,21,garnero santanche fdi mr president ladies gentlemen brothers italy

#PergreffiSimona,Mr President ladies and gentlemen we are faced with a really necessary decree- law because at the moment I think that all Italians are waiting for it to be able to resolve so many of the situations that we have faced with the dear raw materials I will explain some of the speeches that have been developed within the competence of our Commission I think for example to a very important amendment that aims to stimulate the railway traffic of the goods in harbour within previewing the possibility to decrease the canons of the state property concessions on which the terminalistiche activities insist favoring in this way a sustainable transport thanks to the use of the trains with consequent decrease of the emissions of CO2 and the congestion of the roads in the reference areas This is an important amendment that was so much awaited especially with regard to port areas Then there is another very important amendment In these months we have been faced with the dearness of materials linked to the difficulty of finding raw materials In the construction sector whole yards especially now that we are facing the shipyards of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan but also at private yards we cannot find materials especially as regards the insulation they do not arrive and consequently the yard stops and there are completely insane prices which obviously blow up all the financial plans Hence the great importance of an amendment to which I was first a signatory the extension of the building permits in order to allow more space for businesses and private citizens who are currently in a difficult position to close the yards with the deadlines of the licences I think this is a very important measure that we have managed to bring home Then there is the whole issue that has not been completely resolved it will probably find solution in the next measure on the prices to be referred to for construction works which are to be adapted if we had already had an updated price list in January of this year at this date in May it would have been completely out of phase However it is regrettable that an amendment did not end well We are faced with a forecast of 500 million for the fund of the hauliers relative to the goods section Since this sector is currently suffering mainly from expensive fuel excise duties and so on it is very good that there is this fund However one very important category has been forgotten the one relating to passenger transport I am thinking of the tourist buses for example but also the transport of people in general which also find themselves having to fight every day against expensive fuel and even if they have invested in innovative means they find themselves with methane and gas skyrocketing Let us not forget that this category has suffered the consequences of lockdown the stopping of all trips and I am referring not only to school ones but to all in general it has suffered a reduction in capacity to 50 for almost two years and now it is facing the expensive fuels so it really does not manage to move forward So what we asked the government was only the symbolic gesture to remember this really important category which contains so many jobs but it has serious difficulties and so we cannot forget them Soon we will find ourselves to examine another decree law always relative to the question of the excises that it already contains an article on the road haulage and a decree transports I therefore hope after what has happened at this stage that this problem will find a solution,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,18.351772,-11.817872,21,mr president ladies gentlemen faced really necessary decree- law moment think italians waiting able resolve many

#PergreffiSimona,Mr President I would like to thank Mr Morelli and Ms Bini for their help as well as the rapporteurs Mr Paroli and Mr Santillo and the President of the Commission for their work I would like to highlight something that is happening today in the world of infrastructure there are rumours that very soon perhaps even today the guidelines on infrastructure controls will be published which will prevent if confirmed the passage on infrastructure over 40 tonnes If so be careful because in the next few days we will have the blockade of the country and we will find ourselves quietly greeting the PNRR Therefore I ask you to pay the utmost attention on this topic and take advantage of a passage within the decree infrastructures to start to point out that if this happened we would really find ourselves with the country completely blocked because the 40 tons and perhaps the responsibility of the local authorities on the individual infrastructures would really be a heavy load also for what concerns our local and provincial administrators,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,22.42033,-14.451379,21,mr president would like thank mr morelli ms bini help well rapporteurs mr paroli mr santillo president commission work would like highlight something happening today world infrastructure rumours soon perhaps even today guidelines infrastructure controls published prevent confirmed passage infrastructure 40 tonnes careful next days blockade country find quietly greeting pnrr therefore ask pay utmost attention topic take advantage passage within decree infrastructures start point happened would really find country completely blocked 40 tons perhaps responsibility local authorities individual infrastructures would really heavy load also concerns local provincial administrators
#MartiRoberto,"Mr President we are dealing with the conversion into law of the Decree Law on urgent measures to counter the economic and humanitarian effects of the crisis in Ukraine In order to face this international crisis a series of provisions are introduced by the Decree Law in question to meet the exceptional requirements in particular with regard to the performance of production activities to contain energy prices on the Italian market and to face the situation of instability in the functioning of the national natural gas system resulting from the Russian Ukrainian conflict Although the work in the Commission has been very intensive tiring and full bodied more than 1,421 amendments have been produced by all the parliamentary groups and the League is satisfied although not entirely because more can be done The work of our Group has been strong and important on a number of themes We are a little disappointed by small signals that the Government could perhaps have given us about situations that seem small to us but they are great for the various sectors I am referring for example to the amendment which allocated very small funds to rehabilitation centres for disabled people with heated pools used for physiotherapy and rehabilitation in the water then there was our amendment against the cutting of the military which was rejected after a negative opinion from the Government The reduction expected from the next 1° July of another 1,000 units from the Safe Roads operation is a serious damage to our country As a League we will continue to fight for the Forces of Order and for the safety of the Italians In addition the government could accept our amendment on extra profits to banks We had strongly asked to expand the audience of the subjects called to pay the extraordinary contribution against the expensive bills A concrete act of social redistribution was needed increasing the taxation of extra-profits from 10 to 25 and extending it also to banks and financial intermediaries operating in the energy sector If our amendment had been approved and accepted by the Government it would have guaranteed revenues to the State and consequently the distribution of profits to millions of Italians but also to cover the burdens to remove the distorting effects contained in the norm that penalize several companies It would have been a gesture of social justice a fair and necessary measure to reduce the costs of expensive energy and to help families and businesses It is also true however that other small great signs have arrived thanks to the work done by the Lega Group with the rest of the majority and the insistence of our party amendments have been accepted which at this time of serious post Pandemic crisis really help our citizens I am referring in particular I thank Giorgio Bergesio and the Group to the payment of fines from milk quotas a very important measure In addition we can be satisfied with the approval of the amendment in defence of our companies with regard to the exports of scrap with which the number of subjects obliged to transmit the export information to the Ministry of Economic Development which can carry out a clear monitoring for all the companies that want to export including those foreign ones This is an initiative that serves to protect our productive realities from unfair market practices that would put in serious difficulty entire sectors from construction to steelmaking with heavy consequences for our companies and social and employment repercussions Another concrete response to entrepreneurs who still struggle to recover from the health and economic emergency and who forcefully ask us not to be left alone in the post Pandemic restart is the approval of the amendment that allows for example bars restaurants and public establishments in general already considered suitable to continue after payment to enjoy outdoor tables and chairs throughout the summer season without having to produce any new request and without the municipal authorities being able to deny it This will also serve to lighten the municipal administrations themselves as well as the development of our activities We are proud of these and many other results the result of negotiations with the majority of the Government on which I am sure we could not have affected by remaining in opposition Mr President I would like to conclude my speech on an issue which as a Puglia citizen interests me directly and which concerns me very much which concerns the former Ilva It is not possible I say this to the comrades of this wide ranging government path for the PD to support an initiative of the Movimento 5 Stars trying to vote on that amendment on the former Ilva in the Commission which fortunately has not passed with the opposite opinion from the Ministry of Economic Development only for pure demagogy as it appears clear from the press news of the last hours yesterday and today It is clear that the delays in reclamation operations it should be clarified in the areas of the former Ilva can be attributed to those who have the competence to do so i.e. to the administration of the Commission which we did not put The funds for this are there the money for the reclamations is there but the commissioners are not carrying out the project and everything goes very slowly The rule approved in the decree has been widely discussed with the Presidency of the Council and with all parties of this majority present in the direction booth The objective of the Government and Minister Giorgetti is to accelerate the process of decarbonisation which is necessary in the interest of the city of Taranto aimed at efficient productivity of a key sector of our economy especially in this historical period with the increase of prices and the lack of raw materials",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,24.0309,-17.658361,21,"mr president dealing conversion law decree law urgent

#CortiStefano,Mr President I would like to thank Mr Bellanova for his presence not only today but also during these days that we have been particularly involved in the Commission Before going into the substance of the measure I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the members of the 8th Commission who in a constructive and frank discussion have addressed the complex issue of delegation to the Government in the field of public contracts Above all I extend a special thanks to the two speakers Senator Pergreffi and Senator Cioffi who even before being elected representatives of the sovereign people are above all an expression of architecture and civil engineering so they are endowed with great competence and professionalism Our contribution to simplifying the rules governing public contracts aims to ensure clarity and support for our productive activities I have the great honour to be a signatory together with my colleagues from the League and the entire Commission of amendments that protect Made in Italy in public supplies guaranteeing a majority share of Italian products compared to those from other non-EU countries Indeed the opportunity to relaunch the European funds and the current crisis of our companies had made urgent action to limit the influx into the European markets of products from non-EU countries at low cost and therefore of poor material We have clarified and made more understandable to entrepreneurs the rules that constitute the professional wrongdoing and the reasons that could exclude companies from the bans With the particular sensitivity that characterizes us as League on the territories we have obtained the possibility to divide or to group the contracts in lots This will benefit both in terms of greater market access by small businesses and in terms of the protection of companies operating in a given territory thus enhancing those of proximity For another amendment there is also a success i.e. the mandatory constraint on the review of prices in particular situations This is a great result in order to compare costs to the real development of the market This is an important support for local businesses which will thus be in a position to cope with exceptional and unpredictable situations such as those we have unfortunately been living for months The revision of prices in fact during the execution of the contract proves necessary in order to maintain the mutual balance between the contractor and the performer and thus gives the possibility to the enterprises to make congruent offers safeguarding the principle of healthy and fair competition Moreover during the examination a new discipline of the use of the draw has passed which thanks to the League will have to be strongly limited and regulated because it is a mechanism that degrades the qualification acquired by the enterprises In addition we are also proud of an approved amendment which provides for insurance policies to be borne by contracting stations to cover professional risks in favour of staff employed by contracting stations which was not taken for granted Thus their costs will be borne by the contracting stations themselves Finally two agendas were also accepted by the League and three other important Commission agendas which as the Lega Group we have signed They provide by the Government the commitment to provide for a review of the tariffs of the companies certification body the so called SOA to enhance the experience of the technical director of the works to regulate the theme of fair compensation for professionals engaged in public contracts to timely implement an Italian digital platform of constructions and to provide for the simplification of anti-mafia checks I agree with the words spoken by my friend Senator Paroli just now because it is clear that Parliament despite the work that has been done in the Commission and despite the concrete results that have been achieved must return to being an active part of the legislation and must not derogate from other bodies the task for which we have been elected However I can say that we are proud to have brought these results home which are concrete the result of negotiations with the majority and with the government And it turns out the League could n't have gotten by the opposition,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo

#RuspandiniMassimo,"Ruspandini FdI Mr President I have a different view and I believe that many things could have been done senator only if this government had pulled the plug first I say this because there are so many contradictions in the measure that with the little time available to me I will not be able to list them We are even talking however about the extension of another twelve months for the conclusion of the experimentation of the road traffic of single person vehicles despite the last report of Istat on road accidents is really heavy from 2020 even the wounded pass to 1,980 the dead to nine a pedestrian died due to the clash with a scooter I am only saying this in order to introduce into the Chamber arguments which have not been discussed The Government of the Best still extends the road trial by a year but I did n't understand what you want to experience Net of this the National Observatory on local public transport policies is transformed thanks to the Government of the best into the National Observatory for the support of programming and monitoring of sustainable local public mobility This is therefore a substantial change The local public transport sector whose criticalities are mentioned even in the Government 's own document is in great trouble with an economic and management deficit estimated at about two billion euros excluding the expensive energy and fuel in progress which instead of increasing the budget available in the national fund is reduced by five million euros per year These are the best of the best policies The minister Giovannini instead of overcoming the current serious moment for example establishing as we have proposed a fund for fuel has found nothing better to do than to identify a university professor of first class placed in expectation for the entire duration of the assignment which as happened on the occasion of the identification of the extraordinary commissioners appointed by the same Ministry will watch over the works of the 15 complex public works with a set of projects that are worth more than three billion euros representing interventions of essential road and railway connections with a result that is under the eyes of all works completely firm still unfinished 379 works throughout the national territory for a remnant of expenditure of about 1,2 billion euros In this atmosphere from the end of the empire I do not want to open the parenthesis on Alitalia an example of how a crisis should not be managed The path so far followed by the Government for the announced scaling a probable next sale of this asset to foreigners is before everyone 's eyes I would like to remind you of another subject with which you have rinsed your mouth that of the High Speed in the South In fact it is not true that it is planned all over the South from Salerno to Reggio Calabria it will not be possible to speak of high speed but if all goes well you will be able to assist in many regions of the South to a speed that will be in line with the traditional services I am reluctantly obliged to denounce the fact that an amendment of mine has not been taken into account amendment referring to the exemption proposed by the toll for commuters on the A24 and A25 motorways already proposed by the Gruppo Fratelli d'Italia to the Chamber which was precisely trying to meet the communities of our most marginalized

#CantuMariaCristina,Mr President we are pleased that our proposals also contribute to increasing the awareness that PNRR funds cannot be unwisely spent especially in health care by finalising resources so that we never have to repeat ourselves again and never again find ourselves in the state of unpreparedness and vulnerability in which we were at the beginning of the pandemic Therefore it is strategically important to implement a national health prevention system not only from environmental and climate risks which must be taken into account as stated in Article 27 of the conversion measure but it is essential to bear in mind the need to make a system also for the strengthening and improvement of active and passive surveillance activities with One Health character recognition of determinants and risks and assessment of the impact of interventions prioritising the activities of preparation and enhancement of the capacities of the National Health Service for the identification prevention and response of respiratory diseases with high communicability and pathogenicity as well as prevention and contrast to the occurrence and spread of zoonoses This is why we have for some time insisted and little has been achieved on the preparation of the National Pandemic Plan for Proactive Prevention and Government of the Risks of communicable diseases with endemic and pandemic relevance and zoonotic character and for a vaccination prophylaxis really effective and safe without waste We are faced with a crucial moment in our political and social history which requires us to reaffirm with strength and determination in the current scenarios of war not only the ethics of responsibility but rather to anticipate rather than suffer according to the ethics of prevention as the fundamental principle of institutional action for individual and collective well being governing the evolution of the pandemic with all the tools and measures technically available This model could also be of reference at European level proposing rather than suffering the decisions of Europe affecting with the same authority demonstrated in the economic field also in order to orient health policies finalizing innovation research and resources both for effective and safe vaccines in time and prevention and for the fight against zoonoses whose social and occupational consequences if we continue to approach them deterministally and uncontrolledly risk being no less devastating than the ultraliberal and uncontrolled approaches of the technocrats of the ECB technocrats who have thought of normalizing Europe 's monetary policy reducing Member States sovereign debt purchases and raising interest rates generating a unicum where the remedy is worse than evil after four months of war amplifying an inflationary push already in place indeed predictable and prepared for at least a year whose responsibilities are plastically obvious This is the value of prevention in all sectors responsible for technology at the service of policy not unlike a possible pandemic resurgence on which we must now determine ourselves legislatively indicating the development of prevention and preparation measures to consolidate the return to normality All this calls to political responsibility the Government and the Executive of Brussels and to technical scientific responsibility the agencies and the government offices in charge sanctioning a pact of collaboration with all the structures and offices of public human animal and environmental health as indicated in our amendments for the realization of the essential levels of assistance prevention and protection from the risks of communicable diseases with endemic and pandemic and zoonotic relevance The principles must be strengthened including among the objectives the setting up of strict active and passive surveillance measures with One Health character and the provision that the system will contribute for the profiles of competence to the definition and implementation of the National Pandemic Plan for Proactive Prevention and Risk Governance entrusting to the Ministry of Health the implementation detail with a chronoprogram sure to complement what is not provided for in the decree of the Minister of 9 June We all have to prove that we 've learned much more from the last two years than I read

#CantuMariaCristina,Mr President I am very proud to be able to help represent what may be the most significant innovations in the health of the future contained in Chapter V on health We have already had the opportunity to stress on many occasions that we need more stringent controls so that the national universalist health service can meet the needs of the coming decades ensuring health and protection responses to fragility with appropriateness quality and safety Many of the treatment settings have changed and there are many opportunities offered by predictive medicine artificial intelligence and personalized medicine with diagnosis and targeted and early treatments treatments that have proven the validity hoped to the point that we can say it has also done a good round of buoying on the side of oncology care with innovative drugs and advanced therapies New opportunities that will be made possible under conditions of equal accessibility thanks to the reduction of waste affecting the mechanisms of programming and regulation of supply according to principles of transparency traceability to health data ecosystem valorization of capacities and effective excellence It is true that the treatment will be increasingly expensive and therefore a system of evaluation monitoring and control of the uses and results of the services provided will be increasingly necessary which thanks to the implementation of the registry of the persons assisted finally at national level will make possible the implementation of the electronic health file after more than ten years of hesitations and uncertainties This is a truly historical innovation that the former Article 13 of the draft law which has now become Article 16 of the text proposed by the Commission proposes to systematize linking it to the essential importance of contractual obligations and of which the Government must be given the solemn recognition of having co-thought and transposed the proposals of the legislative I believe with sufficient possibility of success aware that it is a first step and that it will be further refined both on the side of public private and social health equality and on other possible uses of the health card including avoiding the repetitiveness of the recipes whoever is the authorized prescriber or any future green pass since the vaccination data must all be uploaded in the anagraph in real time The new rules in fact will allow to enhance the prevention and marginalization of prescriptive and dispensing inappropriateness This will enable us to address with sustainable spending issues that would otherwise be unbearable for the overall burden of emerging needs and the costs of research and innovation This in addition to generating savings will prevent innumerable waste of time from the assisted citizens After many hours of work we have arrived at a rewording of Article 13 as I said before referring to Article 16 of the measure under discussion which goes in this direction going to update and evolve the rules of accreditation first and then contractualization including supplementary and complementary health for what it actually serves and applies This work promoted by the League but supported by all political forces including opposition which I thank as proof that when the interests of future generations are at stake the opposition is also constructive we can really support the entire legislature alone because the pandemic has taught us how indispensable it is to have a health care that works,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#CantuMariaCristina,Mr President the agenda we are debating is a very important step forward in combining research and innovation in oncology with prevention and care and at the same time in filling the delays accumulated in the last two and a half years of pandemics in the interventions in election and screening with the related costs before all the important commitments required of the government at national oncology with what is essential to its realization that is the economic and financial security of the regions which must ensure appropriate and timely interventions in terms of responding to the needs of citizens at a time of extreme vulnerability of people and families The commitment on which we incite the Government is consequence of what had already been promoted by us in April and accepted in the context of the conversion of Decree Law No 24 with the unanimous approval of the agenda of the same topic last May still unimagined since so far the deficit that has been generated in the various Regions during the pandemic estimated at over five billion although not all spent with shared outcomes but certainly the emerging situation has not given the possibility to the Regions to do otherwise Therefore contrary to other occasions the justification for the request for sterilization of the related costs is absorbent and cannot be separated from the reclamation and therefore from the recognition of adequate resources Last but not least there is the impact of the higher energy costs of healthcare companies we are all experiencing it with the expensive bills which is generating inflation that has not been so violent since the late 1980s I hope that you will all agree and that you will all share and vote accordingly not only the majority but including opposition of which we have had great responsibility in sharing in the Commission the insights into the risks assessed in the possible technical prescription of return plans Last note not self celebrative I would like to draw the attention of all of you to our first draft law to reduce the VAT rate for goods and services for non-self sufficiency and fragility to 5 in order to promote the homelessness of patients supporting people and families in a logic of mutual help and self responsibility which feeds on the responsibility of the State in finding the resources necessary for the protection of LEAs and vulnerabilities not only oncology As well as I conclude Mr President we are rightly debating approving the reduction of excise duties on fuels over a certain level of costs Believe me the support of fragility is no less important,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,19.613094,-21.202469,21,mr president agenda debating important step forward combining research innovation oncology prevention care time filling delays accumulated last two half years pandemics interventions election screening related costs important commitments required government national oncology essential realization economic financial security regions must ensure appropriate timely interventions terms responding needs citizens time extreme vulnerability people families commitment incite government consequence already promoted us april accepted context conversion decree law 24 unanimous approval agenda topic last may still unimagined since far deficit generated various regions pandemic estimated five billion although spent shared outcomes certainly emerging situation given possibility regions otherwise therefore contrary occasions justification request sterilization related costs absorbent cannot separated reclamation therefore recognition adequate resources last least impact higher energy costs healthcare companies experiencing expensive bills generating inflation violent since late 1980s hope agree share vote accordingly majority including opposition great responsibility sharing commission insights risks assessed possible technical prescription return plans last note self celebrative would like draw attention first draft law reduce vat rate goods services non-self sufficiency fragility 5 order promote homelessness patients supporting people families logic mutual help self responsibility feeds responsibility state finding resources necessary protection leas vulnerabilities oncology well conclude mr president rightly debating approving reduction excise duties fuels certain level costs believe support fragility less important
#CantuMariaCristina,Mr President I am sorry to have to remind you once again that prevention and control must be a precondition to avoid the cyclical repetition of problems which give a concentration of interdependence between health both human and animal and economics Not only that but everything must be dealt with in a supranational dimension as our bill no 1660 of two years ago had imagined We hoped that in the PNRR as well as in other circumstances it would serve as an inspiration and that at least in connection with the order in implementation of the motion adopted unanimously in June last year as the Government will surely remember there would be evidence of this No follow up can be found This is another missed opportunity to strengthen veterinary prevention and to relaunch public and private veterinary health Public and private health must be accompanied by the prediction of the corporate veterinarian as a promoter of the culture of the government of the risks and the reduction of the use of unnecessary drugs for example antibiotics which has recorded thanks to the category an important decrease in the inappropriateness estimated at over 30 percent even if the way to get rid of the antimicrobial resistance is still long We must imagine that healthy animal husbandry which is also based on the principles of animal welfare will have an impact on the quality of products intended for human consumption which inevitably affects our individual and collective health closing the circle with the growth of the gross domestic product We must overcome the logic of intervening only with omelets made investing adequately in human and instrumental resources to ensure structural conditions to deal with the emergence of animal diseases and above all to prevent them This is not the first time that we are in the presence of swine fever every time the bill is very salty Let us make sure that the measure in conversion is accompanied by the decision to finally give way to the legislative resolution that we have promoted and that like 12 a The Commission in the light of the examination of the amendment phase of the decree law under discussion has seen the convergence in the drafting of a single text aimed at reforming veterinary public health abandoning the ideologies that have certainly contributed so far to delaying the adoption of an organisational model of prevention evaluation and control capable of becoming a possible reference at European level It is a model specifically dedicated to the government of endemic and pandemic risks of zoonous origin capable of enhancing all producers not only Italians who are equipped with higher standards of prevention biosafety quality and traceability gives legitimacy to its recognition as common rules of guarantee in the implementation of the new European legislation on animal health for the welfare of the consumer changing the paradigm of the protection of Italian agro food with a system of evaluation and control able to demonstrate on the field the superiority of our products not only on the organoleptic level which is recognized us but also in terms of effective protection and promotion of human health and of the fight against communicable diseases and not given our way of addressing and solving related problems according to objective and measurable indicators avoiding any self referentiality in proving conformity to optimal parameters of prevention biosafety and health,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,21.235352,-22.842085,21,mr president sorry

#RipamontiPaolo,Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government I rise to speak on this decree- law which was fired at 2 p.m. this night by the Commission on the merits which I also thank for having hosted me since the measure contained issues that I was interested in from Liguria and Savona I must thank Deputy Minister Morelli and the Government because they have put the attention on a theme dear to me and to the whole of my Province inserting it within this decree infrastructure that is that of the cable cars of Savona This applause has come from years and years of discussion on the subject I would like to mention first of all that also for the part tied to the railway therefore to the Genoa Campasso project have finally been invested through a fund 98 million euros so I strongly thank the Deputy Minister for this project that is functional from the environmental social and economic point of view and also from the point of view of the ecological and energetic transition Today the Commissioner has all the tools to do so he has 60 days to put all the planning criteria in place and so we are well on track For what concerns the cable car the great news is that within the decree law which has a national breath there is a small part that concerns only one territory but this as I have remembered more than once is a very important infrastructure which has suffered a very serious damage a few years ago because of a landslide that has invested the pylons that support it Today we have put ourselves in a position to have everything that was necessary so that this important infrastructure which it must not be forgotten gives a living to sixty families and which today has become ecologically modern because it eliminates all the road transport from the city can be built We had tabled an amendment which was the son of a great territorial consultation and the great news is that the territory when it finds a minimum of synthesis manages to do things well and to generate proposals even when the people who confront it have different extractions and also politically distant In this case local authorities trade unions employers and even those interested in having a concession tomorrow have come together and produced this amendment The amendment has not seen the light in its entirety but I would like to thank you Mr Vice Minister for this small step we have taken with the rewording in fact once again states if necessary the strategic importance of this infrastructure It is only a small step but I hope and I say this in the pre-election campaign that the next government which I hope is centre right will not miss the opportunity to complete an infrastructure which from the point of view of planning and investment is absolutely necessary I will end by thanking everyone including the entire 8th Commission my Parent Company Senator Simona Pergreffi and Senators Maurizio Campari Gianfranco Rufa and Stefano Corti who have never stopped supporting a small part of our territory which is very important to me,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,21.930822,-14.373137,21,mr president ladies
