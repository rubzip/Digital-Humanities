#PabloSáezAlonsoMuñumer,"Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen Minister we are discussing an amendment to the full refund of the bill to boost employment pension schemes presented by the Gallego Nationalist Block It presents in its justification curious statements that show that they live completely away from reality First he mentions that the belief that private management is more efficient than public management is false It may be but it 's not the most common thing at least in Spain Let us remember that the public accounts in Spain have recorded continued deficits since 2008 that will continue in the coming years 3.2 in 2024 according to the Government 's estimate Honestly I do n't know any efficient managed private companies that have been in loss for fourteen years and continue to exist If Mr. Rego knows any please let us know about her On the other hand the net assets of the consolidated accounts of the state public sector of the year 2020 that is the difference between what we have and what we have shows a negative figure of 579 412 million euros a whole example of efficient management for Mr Rego and the Gallego Nationalist Block What is clear is that both the Gallego Nationalist Block and the Communist Social Government do not know the concept of efficiency of public expenditure and this is demonstrated by the Institute for Economic Studies which quantifies the inefficiency of public expenditure by EUR 60 billion an inefficiency which had already been demonstrated a few years ago by the political party Union Progreso and Democracy Secondly it mentions disinformation and manipulation campaigns on the viability of the pension system It may be but I imagine it will refer to the ongoing disinformation campaigns of the Government and its partners Let us remember that the Social Security accounts are balanced by transfers and loans from the State and that given the deficit situation in the public accounts there will be an increase in the total debt of the public administrations a debt that already stands at 1 427 763 million euros that is more than 30 100 euros per capita Or perhaps we should include in the disinformation campaign to the International Monetary Fund which is warning that if inflation is at 5.1 let us remember that we are at 7.6 pension spending will increase by € 77 billion per year Another issue mentioned as justification for this amendment is that it cannot be accepted as a general mechanism for workers to be able to supplement their public pensions They even talk about the possibility of transferring the management of the economic regime from Social Security to Galicia an obsession of the independenceists in which they will always have us as we have shown with the presentation of a remedy of unconstitutionality for the rupture of the single Social Security box In terms of efficiency I remind you that the debt of the Autonomous Communities in September 2021 was 310,180 million euros Let 's see an example of efficiency Let us now proceed with the bill to boost employment pension schemes We are talking about a bill that remains short in its proposals consolidates inequalities and points to political leadership First there are clearly insufficient tax incentives incentives that focus on bonus social security contributions but they forget to incorporate an additional incentive into corporate tax as it existed until 2012 Secondly they set limits on the maximum contributions of workers to their employment plans and make them dependent on the contributions of companies It seems that the members of the BNG do not understand either that the increase in the savings to be generated by the employment pension schemes will make it possible to have greater resources in the national economy as a whole to invest increase productive capacity and thereby create employment and raise the standard of living of the Spanish society Thirdly the interference of the State in the management of the money of the workers and self employed is protected since it will be public employees of the ministries who decide what is done and where the money of the public promotion plans is invested Fourthly it is a bill that discriminates against self employed workers who can only be deducted a maximum of € 5750 per year between the employment pension plan and the individual plan and moreover do not have the corporate share subsidies that companies do have Fifthly it is a bill that consolidates the discrimination of individual pension schemes since contributions with right to deduction in the IRPF are maintained at 1500 euros Sixthly it consolidates discrimination against the outside territories where the limit of the annual contribution to the individual social security system is 5000 euros compared to 1500 euros from the rest of Spain Ladies and gentlemen in VOX we are voting for mechanisms to supplement the public pension In VOX we are voting for measures to improve the quality of life of pensioners In VOX we vote yes to efficient public management That is why Mr Rego we voted in favour of your proposal in VOX Thank you very

#PabloSáezAlonsoMuñumer,"Thank you Mr. President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The Government presents us with a social security budget that contains very significant data First thing Despite the € 38,904 million in transfers a deficit for non-financial operations of € 7199 million is budgeted which has multiplied by almost five since 2011 but does not prevent a continuing deficit for non-financial operations Let us remember that in order to finance these transfers and the loans covering the remaining deficit the State has to be indebted and the question is can public accounts ensure the level of transfers in the future The answer is no and we are based on three main reasons The first is that the projected deficit in the public accounts will amount to 3.9 of GDP in 2023 that deficit according to the stability programme will continue for the next two years and that deficit according to the estimates of the International Monetary Fund will exceed 4 by 2027 The second reason is that Spain 's public debt is at a historical peak reaching the amount of EUR 1.5 trillion The third reason is that the Social Communist Government has no intention of cutting political spending Second of all The amount of passive class pensions which are not part of the Social Security budget amounts to EUR 20.5 billion If we add to this amount transfers and loans we are talking about EUR 69 billion of expenditure that is not financed by social contributions Third dice A social contribution income of EUR 14,702 million is budgeted below the contribution pension This is a gap that will widen in view of the current population pyramid and the early retirement of the baby boom generation a gap that is 5.2 times greater than the contribution of 2793 million euros to the intergenerational equity mechanism Fourth given An increase in income from social contributions is proposed by 11.5 over the budget of 2022 and by 8.4 over the forecast for the liquidation of this financial year It is an increase linked to the rise in the maximum contribution bases and to economic growth Let 's look at both conditions First condition increase in the maximum contribution bases With an unemployment rate of 12,7 the highest in the European Union and after increasing labour costs as a result of the introduction of the intergenerational equity mechanism increasing the maximum contribution basis by 8,6 is a complete irresponsibility It is irresponsible as a further increase in labour costs following the rise in the price of energy raw materials intermediate goods interest rates and taxes is an additional burden on companies It is irresponsible since those companies with problems in shifting the cost increase to prices which are mainly SMEs may be forced to reduce their activity create jobs or raise wages less in the face of the fall in their production margins It is irresponsible to increase labour costs with unemployment rates ranging from 1.7 to 2.2 times the euro area average since 2008 and with a youth unemployment rate doubling that of that area It is irresponsible not to take into account macroeconomic projections such as those made by the Banco de España which show for the period 2022 2024 that employment seems to be losing vigor and which point to a decrease in business turnover and the existence of a deterioration in confidence indicators Secondly economic growth that will boost income from social contributions However neither in Spain nor outside Spain is the forecast for growth of 2.1 of GDP by 2023 Ladies and gentlemen of the Government what can never be lacking in a budget is credibility and it is that Socialists in the light of your actions you cannot speak of credibility I remind you of three cases in 1985 the Socialists passed a pension law which according to their union meant a reduction in the average retirement pension of 21.3 in 2011 the pensions were frozen to more than six million Spaniards and in 2021 the maternity supplement was lowered in the pensions of mothers of large families Nor do they have credibility when they speak of avoiding the intergenerational conflict curious request of those who have left behind examples in their history of fostering conflict curious request of those who have raised the debt of each Spanish since they came to power in more than 6000 euros curious request of those who forget that the real dam of containment so that an intergenerational conflict does not arise is the family because it is in it that we see reflected the values of effort generosity commitment example affection respect equality solidarity and responsibility In conclusion I will recall a phrase that Minister Escriva recently said from the public uncertainty must be mitigated It 's a first step towards wisdom It must now be realized that making unrealistic growth estimates does not mitigate uncertainty that budgeting with deficits does not mitigate uncertainty that increasing public debt does not mitigate uncertainty that increasing labour costs does not mitigate uncertainty And it is that ladies and gentlemen socialist policies never mitigate uncertainty Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,47.57294,-14.015118,20,"thank mr. president good afternoon ladies gentlemen government presents us social security budget contains significant data first

#PabloSáezAlonsoMuñumer,"Madam President we are talking about the opinion of the Joint Committee on Relations with the Court of Auditors on the declaration on the State 's general account for 2019 an opinion in which the Government is urged to meet the objectives of budgetary stability and financial sustainability A Government that does not listen or simply does not want or does not know is urged Let us review the general account of the State and see some data showing us what the concept of budgetary stability is for the Social Communist Government First we are talking about a negative net worth in 2019 of 451059 million euros that is we owe 451,059 million euros more than we have a negative figure that has increased in the year 2020 to 579,412 million euros These figures are the cumulative result of inefficiency and irresponsibility in the management of the public accounts of successive PP and PSOE governments in recent years Let us remember that from 2010 to 2019 the negative net assets of the public accounts have increased by 255,330 million euros Second The loss attributed to the dominant company amounts to EUR 37,792 million in 2019 That is while the Spanish economy grew to 2.1 in 2019 the revenue from ordinary management grew to 4.1 interest rates remained at 0 the public accounts recorded a loss of € 37 792 million That ladies and gentlemen has only one name and it 's called incompetence Third A total debt adding short and long maturitys of EUR 1,117,068 million debt that is the result of accumulated inefficiencies of previous years inefficiencies that are demonstrated in the fact that during the period 2010 to 2019 for each euro of GDP growth the debt increased by EUR 3,14 Fourth Financial expenditure amounting to EUR 24 837 million a very high amount as a result of an irresponsible increase in public debt which conditions the rest of public expenditure Secondly I would like to stress two motions for resolutions tabled by the VOX Group which were not adopted by the Commission First Define and quantify the collection required to have an additional euro of effective public expenditure as well as efficiency costs compliance costs and administration costs Pure common sense they add to a situation of strong deficit in the public accounts Monday To study the implementation of the budgetary methodology of the zero base budget with a view to providing greater efficiency in the use of public resources providing better information when making decisions and contributing to the reduction of the medium term public deficit Again pure common sense They refuse to budget on a zero basis because they know that in applying this methodology the inefficiencies and duplications that exist in the State and that they refuse to commit will come to light Thirdly I would like to talk about the Court of Auditors From the VOX Parliamentary Group we have already denounced the lack of respect for democracy which is the pact reached by PP PSOE and Podemos to distribute the Ombudsman the Court of Auditors and the Constitutional Court With that pact we said in its day institutions are surrendered and the defence of the rule of law is weakened against those who are committed to attacking it a pact that gives oxygen to separatists and a government that tramples on the Constitution The passage of time has given us reason as evidenced by the fact that the first major decision of the Court of Auditors after its renewal was to accept the resources of the convicted jolters for the Generality to approve the € 5.4 million It should be recalled that the Court of Auditors prior to its renewal had rejected the Generality 's endorsement and announced the embargo to twenty eight Angolan leaders The worst is that ultimately we are all the Spaniards since the Generality has no money has debts and of great importance Let us remember that in September 2021 the Generality has a debt of 82,936 million euros of which 66,936 is debt to the State since no one buys debt from the Generality of Catalonia Finally we are faced with a general state account with a negative net worth We are faced with political parties that are not interested in analysing the efficiency of spending We are facing a lack of respect for democracy which presupposes the pact between the PP the PSOE and Podemos Ladies and gentlemen by principle by credibility by consistency by integrity by respect for democracy VOX does not participate in the vote on the renewal of the posts of the Court of Auditors Ladies and gentlemen as a matter of

#RodrigoJiménezRevuelta,"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen good morning We are faced with a bill that of hybrid asymmetries which returns again to Congress as other parliamentary groups have said after passing through the Senate for approval today The draft law transposes a Community directive the main basis of which is to avoid tax avoidance in such a way as to prevent transactions between an entity of a Member State in this case Spain and another of a Member State or third countries from occurring where the same expenditure is deductible twice which is deducted from expenditure without weighing the equivalent income the double non-inclusion of an income or the double use of tax credits We call these situations hybrid asymmetries and they are presumed to be hybrid legal qualifications that cause tax asymmetries that can be used as instruments of aggressive tax planning to achieve the objective of tax avoidance However the bill of Royal Decree 4/2021 leaves much to be desired and demonstrates once again the abuse and totalitarianism of a Government that interferes with the legislative power making it a despotic and absolutist regime And it is ladies and gentlemen because this government has kidnapped the legislature and I explain myself Because during its proceedings in Congress the spokesman for the Socialist Group stated that it should not have been dealt with as a bill and yet an amendment of the Socialist Group was incorporated into its proceedings making the remaining amendments that improve the legislative text and then in the Senate used this bill to incorporate seven more amendments The rejected amendments emphasized the elimination of the cascade effect of tax groups and the temporary abolition of the digital services tax better known as the Google rate which we believe should be done within the OECD environment In fact the introduction of this tax has been a failure having raised up to November 165 million of the planned 968 million And secondly because of what has been experienced in the Senate admitting several amendments from this parliamentary group and producing a legislative latrociny whose excuse has been that the Google rate suppression amendment submitted does not have the proper relationship of congruence with the bill However seven amendments of the Socialist Group have been incorporated into the draft law including six relating to the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union on model 720 And I ask you ladies and gentlemen If the amendment concerning the Google rate does not maintain the proper relationship of congruence with the bill do the amendments concerning the amendment of model 720 do so Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party and other co-religionaries who support the Government you are usurping the General Courts legislative capacity damaging both institutions and generating in citizens tiredness and mistrust However with regard to the incorporation of the amendments of the PSOE into the draft law on the sanction imposed on Spain by model 720 it is necessary to explain what it is because I am sure that many in their homes will be asking and I am convinced that many of your ladies and gentlemen do not know it Model 720 is an information statement which is presented each year in March which relates to goods and rights located abroad and is presented in excess of EUR 50 000 And this started in 2013 when Cristóbal Montoro was Minister of Finance a model that did not take into account the prescription and sanctions 150 of the undeclared amount curiously two of the criteria for which Spain was sanctioned by the Court of Justice of the European Union A striking example of Hacienda 's abuse of this model is the famous case of the retired taxi driver from Granada who declared out of time that he had 340,000 euros of a participation of a sicav in Switzerland and for which he had to enter Hacienda 188 000 euros that is 55 of what he had and a sanction of 150 that is 254,000 euros was claimed In total 442,000 euros were claimed 102,000 euros more than he had And you ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party and ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party stood idly by while this taxpayer was being sanctioned in addition to collecting and confiscating much more than he had and did nothing to change it Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party you have been ruling since 2018 and could have processed or changed the legislative text so that these sanctions would not apply or that the prescription would be taken into account In fact in 2015 you suggested to the government that model 720 should be presented as an out of date declaration avoiding the application of the 150 penalty Why did n't they change it when they came to the government Out of ineptitude You 've been portrayed But this disintegration is even worse because during the processing of the draft Law on the Prevention and Combating of Tax Fraud in May 2021 this parliamentary group and the deputy speaking to them in the debate in the Commission of the said Law within the amendments defended number 75 which proposed the repeal of several articles of the Law on Corporate Tax and Law 7/2012 which have to do with the imprescriptibility of model 720 and the disproportionate application of sanctions so Spain has been sanctioned It turns out that now the government nine months later and after the sentence on Spain 's costs incorporates the same amendment that VOX presented in May in an act of cynicism proper to an incompetent and ineffective government Once again VOX was right and proposed in May last year the possibility of repealing part of the legislative text on model 720 And as always the absence of common sense in your ladies and gentlemen demonstrates your political blindness Dependence on a charge irreparably damages the optic nerve that allows them to discern reality Thank you so much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,49.847267,-9.045552,20,"thank

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,Thank you President Good morning ladies and gentlemen This amendment to the bill on tax popularly referred to as municipal surplus value causes as you know in Royal Decree 26/2021 the royal decree of the haste the one that arranged the minister in one weekend not to stop the cash register clinc clinc I would like to clarify in case some people do not know that they are seeing us from their homes that this tax already set it in its penultimate version by the People 's Party back in 2002 Yes Mr Montoro this one has a lot to do with Montero so in addition to having almost the same surname when they raise taxes they pass it as they say in my land better than a hare in a vineyard The PSOE then continues the saga keeping this tax in its terms first with Zapatero then with Sánchez and finally the Constitutional Court putting some sanity extinguished it But the culebrón does not end here because the PSOE reinvents the tax two months ago and now the People 's Party with its amendment to the whole is going to make up the reinvention of the sanchoist regime with some slight exemption from a joke but the question is that it keeps the tax in force On the contrary the VOX Parliamentary Group which announced on 2 December the full challenge of this rule enacted to reinstate a new surplus value tax challenged it for two reasons First because the legislative figure used by the minister the royal decree- law and his haste deceivingly disguised as urgent necessity was not the right one that is what did not solve in two years arranged it on a weekend And second for the content of the rule which reinvents a new formula for the sole purpose of continuing to attack unjustifiably the pocket of the Spaniards This challenge that I announced to you today is materialized in two actions An action in the legislative plane bringing to this House an amendment to the whole of the above mentioned rule that we are dealing with today as a draft law and in which we propose an alternative text worked reflected and impregnated with common sense and sense of state and which reflects the definitive expulsion of our legal order from this unconstitutional confiscational and unjustified imposed A second action very important and which I thank publicly to the magnificent legal team of VOX led by our secretary general Mrs Olona in the judicial field by the lodging of an unconstitutionality appeal to this infamous royal decree- law which was pergenuated one afternoon on a weekend after a congress by the largest collector of the kingdom to the braves and their way The amendment to the whole of which the VOX Group is bringing to the debate proposes the amendment of Article 59 of the consolidated version of the Local Finance Act and the deletion of Articles 104 to 110 and consequently the definitive elimination of this tax Since all the initiatives that we have put forward since VOX enjoy rigour and justification this amendment could not be less and the origin of it is not based on an ideological whim or on very chulian ideas but rather brings its cause in the common sense and in our objective which is nothing but to improve the lives of the Spaniards Having said that the various rulings of the Constitutional Court which I will not repeat have come to reveal the profound collision of this tax figure with the principle of constitutionality,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,49.068386,-8.963938,20,thank president good morning ladies gentlemen amendment bill tax popularly referred municipal surplus value

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,As I say these rulings of the Constitutional Court have come to reveal the profound collision of this tax figure with the constitutional principle of economic capacity a principle which has been raised above the collecting anxiety of any government of the Government of Sánchez and also of other previous governments which did not blush to shape this tax see Mr Montoro although today its successors who call themselves opposition tear their clothes and amend themselves Consequently it was entirely necessary to accompany the legal system to such unconstitutionality judgments imposed on the tax in question in the last four years Thus the rule that we come to amend today in subtotality apparently deals with this matter but we believe that it is not enough to adapt the tax to the constitutional jurisprudence that has fallen since 2017 but that it is necessary to proceed to its immediate abolition One of the fundamental reasons for this is that this tax is double taxation with other figures in our tax system since they all charge the same amount of income or wealth and therefore we are faced with a clearly confiscatory tax figure For this reason and in order to be respectful first with the efforts of the Spaniards to contribute to the maintenance of public expenditure and secondly with the constitutional principles of economic capacity and non-confessorship of our tax system it is appropriate to definitively expel the tax from our legal system The double taxation to which we refer is apparent when we are faced with a tax which imposes an increase in the value of land of an urban nature a tax similar to that on which for example taxes on the income of individuals or corporation tax taxes which are also applicable to property gains or increases understood as increases in value In summary for example we could say that there is double taxation between surplus value and the IRPF in onerous and lucrative transmissions between individuals between surplus value and corporation tax in onerous transmissions between legal persons and with inheritance and donation tax We also find cases of double taxation between surplus value and some special contributions required by the municipalities for the realization of public works or services All of this is coupled with the fact that the legal configuration of the tax has not even come to consider the actual economic capacity of the taxpayer but rather a non-existent or fictitious one On the other hand the collecting power of this tribute which seems to make it indispensable or irreplaceable for the necessary financing of local corporations is not a sufficient reason to justify its existence but the reasonable approach would be the opportunity for a reform of the financing system of the municipalities adapting financial needs to the competences and therefore to the services they provide However neither the different governments of Spain nor the municipalities themselves have shown sufficient interest in promoting a reform in this regard since 2017 but have preferred to rely on a relevant part of their collection to a merely powerful tribute and discussed foundations to the point of continuing its validity four years after the first ruling of the Constitutional Court which laid down the very existence and legal configuration of the tribute Since 2017 the different governments in appearance of a different political colour have chosen to sacrifice the pocket of the Spaniards rather than to legislate to reduce their fiscal effort As for the parallel action that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech we are talking about the filing of an appeal of unconstitutionality by our parliamentary group which is based on the fact that a new tax cannot be created through the figure of the royal decree- law however much the government of the regime claims an urgent treacherous and treacherous need But the most indecent and immoral thing in a boast of contempt for the pocket and the intelligence of the Spaniards was to hear from the Minister of Finance herself that this was arranged by her on that famous weekend Therefore with the filing of this appeal by VOX we again keep our word to give the battle against the unjust rules of the sanchist regime on all fronts including the judicial one And since we already know that you are quite predictable unoriginal and very repetitive in your balance and corner narrative the Socialist Group which supports the government and protects the minister will go up to the rostrum as well as to talk about hatred xenophobia far right sanitary cordon and other disqualifying adjectives but for each of those disqualifying adjectives that verbalize we put on a pin a medal a bracelet or smoke a pure according to the day because it does not offend anyone who wants but who can I am going to go ahead with your report and say that we have worked intensively on this amendment in an integral way not only to propose the abolition of the tax but also by calculating the possible budget deficit which the municipalities will suffer by eliminating this tax from the tax inferno that we suffer in Spain In addition we have come to propose the source for funding The economic impact of this tax on the municipalities has been estimated at approximately EUR 25 billion per year taking into account the historical collection process This meagre amount of resources can be compensated without the Spanish having to face a new embezzlement eliminating certain unnecessary and superfluous toxic costs which are already found in the approved General State Budgets and which do not provide any utility or service to the Spaniards In this way these EUR 25 billion that the State would no longer spend on frivolities could be used to finance the municipalities without the Spanish seeing the public services that they need being undermined There are many tolls that this Government must pay among other things to certain coalition partners in order to remain artificially in power and therefore these excesses must not be borne or financed free of charge by the Spanish in exchange for anything they must be eliminated by democratic hygiene and so we get two by one As we reduce the fiscal strength of the Spaniards we are embarking on a true ecological transition not the one you preach but the real one eliminating toxic and harmful waste that will improve the health of state institutions and oxygenate our democracy Thus we eliminate for example within the high ranking staff and high burdens some possible fingered and others in current expenses and services the regime 's propaganda for example or the regime 's agenda is called 2030 within the Ministry of the Interior subsidies to political parties the ministry of inequality what you call inclusion which is really excluded from the Spanish in the Ministry of Labour mariscatos and the like the ministry as a whole of the anticonsumption of Spanish products the Ministry of Universities which has no functions and some details of presidency and democratic demoralism All this which I have here perfectly detailed if you want then I pass it amounts to the amount of 2587 million euros Squared the accounts with the current approved budgets we do not raise the budget of expenses we offer to the municipalities a total certainty in their resources without needing to raise the taxes to anyone will not produce the unwanted effect of increase in the price of the buildings which is another of the pernicious sequels that generates this tribute and so we are dismantling chiringuitos and eliminating a lot of expenditure whose marginal utility is negative for Spain and the Spaniards Thank you very

#EmilioJesúsDelValleRodríguez,With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen Madam Minister first of all I would like to thank you for coming to this House and also for the explanations you have given us regarding Section 22 Territorial Policy We said last year that his ministry was deflated he was stripped of the powers of public administration public governance public service and everything related to transparency and good governance and he was left with the powers that he did not have many years ago of general direction of territorial policy coordination They really only have powers of proposal and execution in this field and of relations with autonomous communities and local entities Therefore within this ruin budget your budget section has virtually nothing to do with anything It is not an investor budget almost everything is chapter 1 staff expenditure and current expenditure and as a novelty what has explained to us from the plan for Ceuta and Melilla but where you say 700 million in the budget only 21.5 million are collected I do n't know where they got the 700 million Oh well to several years as you have planned In the 2023 budget I have just checked 21.5 million come not 700 which is different very different Otherwise it 's more of the same They keep the 6 million euros for friends of government delegates which is the third year I 've been reporting it because it 's a scandal a shame As little has appeared this year in this Congress I will tell you the news My parliamentary group tabled a non-legislative proposal to regulate the maximum number of advisers in government delegations without limit we left it open and therefore let them set a maximum number His Government opposed and the majority of Frankenstein who supported him dropped the non-law proposal In view of this we present another non-law proposal in this case so that at least the twenty one friends of the delegate of the Government of Andalusia were reduced because it is a shame moreover they are not known They are not known at the headquarters of the Delegation of the Government of Andalusia The Socialist spokesman on the Commission told us it is that eight provinces and there are seven sub- delegations plus the delegation and therefore they touch less than three per province And it gave us the impression that they were in the sub delegations which would be a fraud of law because the current legislation prohibits sub- delegates from having advisers Then if they 're using government delegates they 're in law fraud But of course why does Castilla and León which has nine provinces one more have only five advisers They play half advisor by province Then the argument I do n't know falls by its own weight That non-legislative proposal was also not successful and then we said that they would carry out a study of the workloads of government delegations and new job and function relationships that might be done by staff We told them that it might have to be determined that it had to be made by career staff And we did not object to the opening of the coverage of those posts for free appointment so that when another delegate of the Government was able to Caesar and appoint another career official in accordance with the legally established procedure Nor have they done anything they have neither studied nor changed the employment relationship You guys look very comfortable with your chiringuito A year ago from this very rostrum I told him that I gave up giving me the resumes of others but that I gave the twenty one of Andalusia Not only has he not given them to me but he is failing to comply with a final judgment of the Supreme Court which is very serious Because my group has taken them to the courts and the Supreme Court has handed down a final judgment that obliges them to hand over the curricula we had requested They started sending them to them and when they had already sent us the third package which was that of Catalonia someone ordered in the ministry that no more packages of government delegations will be sent to us And if you do n't know it from this moment on you 'll find out because you 're going to do a year of the sentence in March and at the end of January as you have n't fulfilled we 're going to demand responsibilities I 'm not going to bitteren the turret and I 'm going to let Christmas and Kings pass but at the end of January we have responsibilities We all know that the autocrat laughs at the separation of powers but then he washes his hands and leaves them lying down and the person directly responsible for the non-compliance will be you and as they disable it for non-compliance I do n't know what they 're going to do Finally I say to him that at the end of January we demanded responsibilities for non-compliance with a final judgment of the Supreme Court You ask citizens to comply with sentences for example because it is the worst thing that a ministry does not comply with a final ruling of the Supreme Court My group is concerned about the drift of this Government which is endangering the unity of Spain by the handovers to the blackmails of the separatists the coups the billionaires And actually it 's a shame because what did n't get the ETA with 857 murders is getting it now for Mr. Sanchez 's assignments That is tremendous and causes much damage to the unity of the homeland and to the unity of all Spaniards It 's going to take many years in that fracture that you 're causing I conclude because the President is going to take the floor You said earlier that these budgets are the antidote to the war in Ukraine I do n't know what your budget section has to do with the war in Ukraine but good For us it is the budgets of ruin and again it is believed that this government is more concerned about the welfare of politicians and their friends than about the well being of all Spaniards Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,43.860718,-15.437522,20,coming presidency ladies gentlemen madam minister first would like thank coming house also explanations given us regarding section 22

#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,"Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen just two years ago the government of Pedro Sánchez came to this House to ask for a blank cheque for its budgetary policy The gravity of the epidemic the imperative need to give an extraordinary response to an extraordinary situation and the difficulty of making realistic predictions could apparently justify the suspension of fiscal rules but the background irresponsibility and budgetary indiscipline of this Government were to relax the control that this House has an obligation to carry out to the Executive Once again there was only VOX left We then refuse to be complicit in an uncontrolled increase in spending that would put us in a situation of extreme vulnerability without framing it into a budgetary rebalancing plan that would ensure the sustainability of public accounts Minister it is required by law but for two years it has not complied with the legal obligation set out in section 11.3 of the Budget Stability and Financial Sustainability Act I remember him because he says not with his head That law expressly states Minister that the temporary deviation of the public deficit cannot endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term and moreover that in cases of extraordinary deviation must be accompanied by a rebalancing plan and that such a plan must be referred within a maximum period of one month from the date on which the non-compliance is found or the circumstances justifying it are assessed I remember it because the Banco de España and the AIReF remind you of it every time they get a chance Last time only 15 days ago Humbly we have also been claiming the VOX Parliamentary Group through numerous initiatives for more than two years and today we are claiming it again The health of public accounts is one of the foundations of a country 's credibility which you have laminated Socialist ladies and gentlemen when you have no explanation for something you always welcome the same magic triangle virus Putin Franco They have not yet had the boldness to bring us to Franco on this occasion but in these years of extreme suffering for Spanish society we always have a constant the consolidation of superfluous public spending and the failure of the objectives that justified the extraordinary suspension of fiscal rules saving companies saving jobs and being next to the Spaniards who most needed it Let us not forget that in these years the Government of the twenty two ministries has consolidated and increased political spending as never before seen in Spain In the worst moments of our history it is when we have had the government that has spent most of our history Never has a Government held higher positions advisors and trusted staff and while companies were struggling to survive while families tightened their belts they were raising salaries There has been a 56 increase in union departures they have renewed the fleet of official cars they have more than doubled the expenditure for official advertising and advertising they have saved Chavista airlines they have fired the expenditure on feminist bars and fed ideological guilders Ladies and gentlemen the suspension of the tax rules triggered the public deficit and placed the debt in historical terms but it did not at all prevent the biggest increase in poverty in the euro area the irreversible damage that has been caused to the productive fabric and that Spain has been released in recovery We are the latest in the table of the European Economic Evolution League 2019 2022 And it turns out that now without ERTE without extraordinary expenditure of unemployment benefits without the presence of automatic stabilisers to justify it they present us with a ceiling of expenditure of EUR 2 billion higher than that of that extraordinary moment and they give every correction of the deficit to the increase of collection largely derived from inflation and also derived from all the taxes that the Minister of Finance has denied me four times that they were going to carry out to the most suffered Spaniards Another twist of the irresponsible reckless and openly damaging budget policy which two and a half years after the pandemic makes recovery enormously difficult and which will unfortunately leave very difficult scars to heal Minister we 've been warning you for three years and unfortunately the time has come After the July rise on 8 September the Council of the European Central Bank decided to raise interest rates in the euro area by 75 basis points the greatest increase in its history and Spain unfortunately will start paying and much for the interest of the debt and the rise of the rates catches us without the duties done The imbalance in public accounts is already structural not cyclical and the AIReF warns you that with these policies public debt could reach 140 of gross domestic product The structural reforms have been abandoned and not only that is that today in Spain the education system or the framework of work or the sustainability of pensions are worse than two years ago not better and the only solution you propose is to raise taxes again and to extract more income from the Spanish sufferers Minister there may be only one more VOX left but do n't count on us to continue firing political spending in an irresponsible way while hiding the reality from the Spaniards of how the fiscal pressure is rising Families SMEs traders and self employed people have endured much they can no longer do so According to the Civismo Foundation the Spaniards worked on average 193 days to fulfill their tax obligations until July 13th the day of fiscal liberation but it is that with the inflation of 10,5 for which the dogmatism of this government is very responsible the Spaniards will work thirty eight more days this year until August 20th only to counter the rise in prices and you not only avoid suppressing one of their privileges and prebends not only do you not deflate the IRPF receiving 15 billion euros extra it is that above you announce more ascents Ladies and gentlemen this government has already done too much damage to Spain it has blown up the foundations of budgetary policy and once again Your Honor we are going to say no VOX is not going to be co-responsible for this hunchback Rectify re-activate the path of responsibility approve a credible fiscal consolidation plan and therefore return the credibility to the public accounts of a nation which is the best presentation card in the outside world because you may be overwhelmed by mathematics and the game is to exchange prisoners for budgets but that time is running out ladies and gentlemen The Spaniards will soon stop paying for the party of sanchismo

#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,"Thank you Madam President The consolidated budget of the Ministry of Presidency will increase from 354 million to 481 million an increase of more than a third It is expected in a Government that considers increasing public spending to be an end in itself but it is a disaster for a country that has broken an absolute historical record of public debt We have already overcome the billion and a half euro barrier which is equivalent to 117 of our GDP and is going to be an unbearable slab that we will leave on our children 's shoulders The government presidency expenditure line is multiplied by 2.7 from 51 million to 134 million This is partly related to the increase in staff expenditure from 34 million to 38 million and also to the increase in the number of personal advisers appointed to the finger by the President of the Government from 441 million to 483 million We have the world 's best advised President of the Government It is true that a large part of this increase almost tripled in the government 's Presidency budget is related to the Presidency of the European Union which will be held in Spain in 2023 We hope that this presidency will be exercised with dignity but now we are very much afraid that the President of the Government wants to turn the occasion into a platform for his personal promotion in view of his possible landing in an international body when he has lost the next elections and this is something we cannot afford We cannot allow European milestones to be converted into an international launch ramp for Mr Sánchez or into a stage for the representation of his personal ideological obsessions about feminism climate fanaticism or democratic memory because in the departure for the European Presidency there is a specific section on the dissemination of the principles of democratic memory We are going to give memory lessons to our European partners Since we are talking about this the total budget for democratic memory policies rises from 11.8 million to 13.9 million euros i.e. almost 14 million invested in falsification of history in demonisation of the conservative Spanish media and in reopening of the wounds that were already closed Because indeed socialist gentlemen you are succeeding in rekindling hatred in the great grandchildren of the generation who lived the Civil War that your great grandparents and grandparents had buried many decades ago The story you want to record in the minds of young people is a Manichean fable and the proof is that you hide the crimes of which you consider your side In the fifty five pages of the endless Law on Democratic Memory there is not a single word nor a single sentence devoted to the approximately 60,000 people killed on the left between 1936 and 1939 By erasing them from memory you are killing them morally for the second time By the way these crimes took place under the authority of two presidents of the socialist government Francisco Largo Caballero and Juan Negrin The first of them retains his proud statue in New Ministries while you dig up Queipo de Llano and prepare to dig up José Antonio Primo de Rivera who was murdered by the left after a farce trial By the way many of these deaths took place under the symbol of the sickle and the hammer that the deputy of Podemos proudly displayed in this rostrum yesterday and again the deputy of Podemos has once again claimed the Communist Party a moment ago As among the activities generously financed by the law of memory is the monumentalization of what you call places of memory I will make you Minister some constructive proposals For example they declare a place of memory Paracellos del Jarama where 5,000 people were killed on the left The Model Prison was declared a memorial site where hundreds of political prisoners were killed including several ministers and deputies of the Republic They erected a monolith in the Pías de Barbastro Schools where the fifty one Claretian seminarians were locked up and then shot and erected a similar monument in Caspe where they ran the same ninety one people for the crime of being Catholic By the way these crimes were ordered by the Regional Defence Council of Aragon an anarchist body in which the famous assassin and assailant of international banks reigned Buenaventura Durruti whom Don Gabriel Rufián openly claimed yesterday on Twitter Dismantle the shameful monument to Durruti that exists in Leon They dismantle the numerous monuments to Lluís Companies whose Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias of Catalonia was responsible for some 8,000 executions in Catalonia of the Popular Front And they declare as a memorial the Cape Major of Santander that 40 metre high cliff from where the militiamen took so many victims But these budgets still surprise us it is a departure for and I quote textually the creation of a technical commission for the study of cases of human rights violations against people for their struggle for the consolidation of democracy fundamental rights and democratic values between the entry into force of the 1978 Constitution and 31 December 1983 Let us be clear we are talking about investigating alleged police abuses committed in the fight against ETA and GRAPO in those years of the Transition This means that the government seems to consider that the ETA and GRAPO were fighting for democracy and human rights and not for the secession of the Vasco Country and the establishment there of a communist dictatorship Such was the democratic zeal of the ETA that killed 383 people between 1976 and 1983 including socialist militant Germán González killed in 1979 in Villarreal de Urrechu",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,43.735287,-15.5450945,20,"thank madam president

#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The citizen parliamentary group brings us with it a motion for the Government to define as a matter of urgency a plan for the rebalancing of public accounts that will put an end to the structural deficit and thus achieve the objectives of budgetary stability The truth is that we must praise the citizen parliamentary group for the opportunity of the measure but not for the indolence of this House okay not for the indolence of this House because it seems that this issue of budgetary balance only concerns those who are more focused on prose than on poetry Among those who are very focused on prose we have the Governor of the Banco de España who since the beginning of this parliamentary term in all his appearances in the Committee on Economic Affairs and in the Committee on Budgets has asked us for this pact or this intervention to lead us to a fiscal consolidation agreement In the same sense the AIReF has also urged us Do n't say it 's not the time now Is n't now the time What the governor told us is that it is time to do so regardless of whether the effects can be deployed at a later time Or are you going to make the plan when the house is falling on us In any case I have appointed the Banco de España and the AIReF which are two independent bodies whose independence this House should respect I 'll talk to you about the numbers Look at you let 's take perspective From December 2007 to September 2021 almost fourteen years the gross domestic product has grown only by 100 billion euros alone It 's grown by 9.2 Public debt has grown by 1 billion 47 billion ten times more in absolute terms But I will also say this in relative terms GDP has grown in these fourteen years by 9 public debt has grown by 272 And this is only the Socialist Party 's fault because in those fourteen years we have the Rajoy sexenium included which produced 40 of that 1 billion 47 billion public debt You guys talk about the guys You guys are so lost the guys are already up The rates at the close of 2020 closed by 0.016 if I take the 10 year bond as reference closed by 2021 by 0.395 the last auction was closed by 0.753 this morning it quoted 1.30 as 10 years The whole curve was in 2020 up to ten years in negative rates We 've been with positive guys since we were two years old Okay I mean the low end policy is over But what will this generate They still do not believe that interest expenditure growth has not been noticed The growth in interest expenditure over these fourteen years has doubled we have gone from paying 16 billion to paying 32 billion and if the rates we have today remain fixed in less than eight years we will pay 50 billion Look this waste of interest on account of debt policies has caused us to increase from 16 000 to 32 billion Yesterday The Economist said Think what you want in the short term you will climb something more than you are thinking and in the long less If this were to be maintained we would be leaving at 50 billion in a very short time Look the defence of the welfare state and the defence of the state require balanced public accounts The State in order to fulfil its basic functions security defence justice requires balanced accounts The welfare state in order to deploy quality public services requires balanced accounts This lack of budgetary stability to what leads us or has already led us to the failure of the State to fulfil its basic functions and to a low quality of the public services it provides We have told you many times we have come to save the State and the State from the welfare of you from your tax voraciousness and from your waste I hope that Mr Edmundo Bal does n't give him much of a shame that we 're going to vote with Citizens because really since he 's joined the exalted centrism he needs a rebalancing or at least a parallel it's you Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,44.291313,-11.864466,20,good afternoon

#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen We have come to discuss a proposal by Citizens to correct the harmful effects of the progressive tax in combination with inflation on workers disposable income It is indeed the progressiveness of the tax that generates this harmful effect If the tax were proportional to income the loss of purchasing power entailed by inflation would be the same for the taxpayer as for the public finance However because of this progressiveness the taxpayer 's loss of disposable income is greater than that of the Treasury Rather what is happening because of this progressiveness is that tax revenues increase more than proportionally to inflation while taxpayers tax free revenues increase less As economists say inflation is a tax and an undercover tax In the VOX Parliamentary Group we have always been very concerned about the disposable income of workers and therefore we have tabled an amendment proposing the reduction of social contributions both the bad calls of the employer and those of the worker We say the employer 's bad calls because all of them are actually paid by the worker and by a non-transparent mechanism we avoid the worker knowing that 30 of his effort before paying IRPF VAT special taxes IBI and any other tax that may occur to you has already blown him off the payroll Furthermore we believe that this reduction in social contributions which would at first generate a reduction in public income would be more than offset by the lower need for assistance to the population since there would be an increase in employment But let 's talk about the government executioner because until a few weeks ago the discussion was whether inflation was temporary or permanent but the war that Russia has generated in Ukraine supported by its Bolivian Nicaraguan Venezuelan and Cuban collaborators is generating that the government is putting the blindfold before the wound and is trying to convince us that the bad economic executioner we are accustomed to is always because of external causes In the case of COVID 19 in which you have insisted a lot it has not been so You have a worse economic execution than the rest of the countries In particular you have 267,000 infected per million compared to 57 000 which is the world average you have 2147 dead per million compared to 773 what is the world average and you have the worst economic executioner in the European Union In fact before the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine it was warned that this was the only nation of the 27 that are part of the EU that by the end of 2022 would not have recovered the GDP of 2019 Therefore and remembering what the newspaper El Mundo told us yesterday I textually read to you the headline of the article War is no pretext for incompetence and COVID 19 has been I add Inflation before the outbreak of the Russian war against Ukraine was already 1.7 percentage points higher than the EU average Yesterday the Institute for Economic Studies stated that Spain I quote you textually could reduce its public spending by 14 and continue to offer the same level of public services if it could improve its efficiency to levels similar to those of the OECD average In other words this would save resources of around EUR 60 billion See if we could help the ELA the Francisco Luzón Foundation which has contributed so much to the visibility of this problem if we could reduce that 60 billion In April 2019 in our economic program we proposed a cut of 24 billion in superfluous public spending and you did nothing but throw improvisations at us Now it seems the cut is 60,000 I do not think we were short rather I think that waste has increased over the past three years and as you are the true liberals of this House in the sense that gives you the primary meaning of the dictionary of the Royal Academy you have done nothing but increase spending The latest events have caught us again in the most absolute foresight Three weeks ago we discussed the possibility of starting structural reforms You said he did n't come to the story because it 's never the time for him to live in improvisation and occurrence No gentlemen the worst relative situation in Spain the last of the countries of the European Union in the economic execution and the worst in health matters can only be due to the

#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen This is the third year that I come here to discuss title V and section 6 with which this is almost becoming for me on the day of the marmot really I am telling you this because I do not think there have been any Members in this House who have been more aware of the risks of public debt to the House and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs The debt has not stopped growing in absolute terms at the end of September we were at EUR 1.5 billion since December 2020 it has grown by EUR 160 billion at September this year we were at EUR 77 billion when 66 billion had been budgeted for this year and for next year you have budgeted a growth of EUR 67.5 billion You are shielded for example from the fact that GDP has fallen slightly in recent months but you will also prevent us from increasing GDP in nominal terms because of inflation In any case what you are obviating is that the relevant thing is the growth of the interest expense item which had not grown for ten years and that this year 2023 is going to grow for the first time Why has there been ten years without increasing the interest rate in spite of growing volumes of public debt For basically because the rates have been falling but this has come to an end we have already warned this two years ago and since the minimums of March this year the average rate of outstanding debt has done nothing but grow and this year 2023 we are going to pay at last more than the previous year in particular 31 billion 11 billion more which means that each family will have to devote 2000 euros of its income to the payment of interest on the part of the debt that is attributable to it which is 90,000 euros per family But do you know the worst The worst is that as the policy of low rates has ended as we warned you two years ago and as all debt issued at high rates has practically expired in the year 2022 there is a little bit left which will win at the beginning of 2023 from 2024 all debt renewals will be carried out at higher rates than the types to which it was issued What does this mean That we 're going to get into a spiral of rising financial expenditures that 's going to make public accounts unbearable You guys did n't give a shit about the volume They said What gives me half a billion at 2 more than a billion at 1 Sure it 's the same thing at first How long Until the guys start going up because when the guys start going up double duty costs twice as much and that 's what 's going to happen to us And the rates have risen a lot they have risen by 1.5 in the very short stretch by 2.5 in the short stretch and by 3 which is the most relevant in the long term Indeed it is surprising to hear Mrs Muñoz of Podemos remind us of something that is true that of the 1 100 billion increase in public debt that has occurred in the last eighteen years 450 billion are due to the People 's Party which in its seven years proved to be the government that was in debt more quickly That is true but you have the reversed roles because in 2010 the government that cut the salaries of public employees froze the pensions and had a general strike was the socialist government Look the growth in interest expenditure in the coming years if the current rates are maintained is going to lead us to an annual financial expenditure of the order of 40,000 to 45 billion when right now we are paying 31 billion Imagine what a growth of between 10,000 and 15,000 million is dedicated only to interests and which will have to be drawn from other items That is it will be impossible to maintain policies You see low interest monetary policy has turned you into genuine public deficit junkies Why are they going to control him Why are they going to make structural reforms which are always laborious and unpopular in the short term At the beginning of this legislature the governor of the Banco de España not the president the Banco de España has no president has a governor told us about the five year lost by not carrying out structural reforms We have n't lost a quinquennium gentlemen we 've lost four I repeat four quinquenniums we 've lost In the last eighteen years public debt has grown by 285 of nominal GDP nominal GDP per capita has increased by 33 and accumulated inflation by 35 In other words Spanish people in the last 20 years have lost a 2 per capita income That is the success of the policies that the two parties have led You have no interest none in solving the problem All they ask of the European Central Bank is to lower interest rates using as shields the Spanish to those who have led to this situation You will begin to feel in the public accounts the same way that the Spaniards are feeling in their private accounts the increase in the financial burden will make you unbearable to sustain the welfare state The present austerity is the best guarantee of the future of the welfare state And do n't tell me that there was austerity in the governments of the People 's Party when you yourselves gentlemen of the United Left have recognised 450 billion in debt in seven years of which only 60 000 have dedicated themselves to the bailout cajarioja You will continue in your mistakes the mistakes that have impoverished Spain and make it poorer in the future Thank you very

#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen We live in the times of euphemism We call voluntary termination of pregnancy to abortion or sex reassignment surgery to body mutilation It could therefore not be that we were different in the tax field Thus for example the text for which Citizens present today an amendment to the whole and which presents the two groups defending the Government tells us about a non-taxary public property benefit that is a tax It is a tax for banking and energy companies which are two economic activities as you know very unpopular for two reasons one because they are necessary and no one complains about the price of the unnecessary complains about the price of the necessary and two for the strong mating they have with political power That is why they are so unpopular but in sin these two activities carry penance for their continued support of the 2030 Agenda without respect neither its shareholders nor its customers,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,51.03966,-9.743158,20,good afternoon ladies gentlemen live times euphemism call voluntary termination pregnancy abortion sex reassignment surgery body mutilation could therefore different tax field thus example text citizens present today amendment whole presents two groups defending government tells us non-taxary public property benefit tax tax banking energy companies two economic activities know unpopular two reasons one necessary one complains price unnecessary complains price necessary two strong mating political power unpopular sin two activities carry penance continued support 2030 agenda without respect neither shareholders customers
#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,But we are better at the text of the proposal than that of the amendment which is correct in many cases This is about extraordinary benefits You see that the simple increase in income is going to generate in these two sectors logically a higher tax share that is the growth of profits is already taxed But let 's go further By the very structure of the profit and loss accounts where fixed costs are deductible the increase in income or the financial margin in the bank will generate a more than proportional increase in results So it 's already recorded In any case all of this as the Lady of Citizens has rightly said I bring here looking at my notes is a real tax dip The situation can be given that in the years 2023 and 2024 the results of the sectors concerned fell however they would pay for the new tax because the new tax does not turn on the results it turns on the revenues I 'm telling Mrs. Vehi to confuse profits with income No no no On the other hand they seem to be very low taxes They say 1.2 or 4.8 Hey one case income and one case financial margin This is equivalent to increasing the tax rate by 12 percentage points In other words a 20 increase in the profits of banking and energy institutions would be fully absorbed by the new tax You talk about extraordinary benefits but no one has bothered to define it In any case Citizens gives us a chance The extraordinary benefit in ordinary activities does not exist if you do not review the international financial reporting standards which do not speak of extraordinary benefit In any case there are non-recurring results due to disinvestment but that is not what they charge They 're talking about the temporality of the tax We were afraid of him Mr Rego and Mr Margall have asked that it be more years that it be permanent We already have experience it was told to our spokesman a few days ago with the income tax that the Americans put in the late 19th or ourselves which we carry with the property tax which is extraordinary also since the beginning of the transition But you only tax the financial margins of the bank and the increase in revenues of activities in Spain What do you expect me to generate this Logically it will generate a lack of investment in Spain since the activities in Spain become much less interesting for the investor Lack of investment in energy can be of concern They are that the increase in costs does not move to the companies I do n't know how they intend to do it First it is to put in the National Securities Market Commission and the Bank of Spain some functions that are inappropriate to them especially in a system of price freedom but it is that you make it obvious that any increase in costs is transferred through the vericouetos of the price system to you do not know who Therefore if you say that you cannot transfer it to the customers you better transfer it to the workers you leave them in a worse situation in your collective bargaining Do you intend to set all the ad hoc prices that banks and electrics purchase in all their inputs I do n't recommend it It would be the solution Since they can't transfer it to the customers and they wo n't want it to be transferred to the workers they 'll have to fix everything This is nothing more than an interventionist measure that will create more problems than the ones it seeks to solve At five and ten o'clock this afternoon we received the report from the European Central Bank which you the Socialist Party wanted it not to arrive The European Central Bank report says some very interesting things about this tax First it does not take into account the whole economic cycle that is it does not take into account that the increase in rates will lead to an increase in late payment On the other hand it says that it is not proportional to the entity 's profitability Which I explained to you before that the first 20 growth points you eat enteritos It does not reflect the costs discussed today as required by the European Banking Authority 's guidelines Finally there is much doubt on the part of the European Central Bank as to what the Bank of Spain is doing about price control The Governor of the Banco de España in the Committee on Budgets has already told us In fact rate increases have cost you at the close of the first half of this year EUR 5 billion to the bank because you are dedicated to looking at the profit and loss account but you never monitor the state of changes in the net worth In any case you know that we have not come here to discuss this whether or not we need to require some taxpayers to make an additional effort at this time of economic crisis caused by the European Union 's energy and monetary policies aggravated in the Spanish case by the inefficiency of this government You 've come to something else You have come to have a seclusion of the opposition as many times dividing the nation Today you have touched two friends of yours banking and electrics and you will dictate that it is the enemy of the people who support you after having supported you so many times and so much on

#AlbertoAsartaCuevas,"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon The ceramic industry is a leading sector that has suffered enormously in these years and it is necessary to support its recovery but it is enough of unfulfilled promises Before entering the electoral campaign it would be useful to explain why the companies in the ceramic sector and so many Spanish companies have been left out of funds designed precisely for that purpose for recovery A month ago the ASCER employer met with President Sánchez and sent him the urgency to act on the part of the government and they have received no reply to date only promises Nor do the various ministries to which he has come respond I 'm addressing the government and telling them that before they promise they 'll do it Basically what is happening is the loss of competitiveness in the prices of the product in the ceramic sector compared to our main competitor in the European Union which is not other than Italian which helps the sector with a 40 bonus on the price of gas leaving us in total defencelessness and inferior in terms of competition It must be borne in mind that the lost position on the market is very difficult to recover and that there is competition in the European Union beyond Italy They are countries that in the ceramic sector do not have such a high dependence on gas as is the case with Poland whose companies rely mostly on coal or neighbouring countries such as Turkey which has its own gas and is not suffering from this price rise In this respect as a more obvious example we have the case of the United States of America which at the time for the most part imported Spanish ceramics but which due to the large increase in both material and freight costs and maritime transport has been strengthened its own ceramic industry which exploits its own gas and produces its own land Even there have already been cases of renowned Italian and Portuguese factories that have relocated their production to Tennessee where their government receives with open arms and all kinds of aid and facilities for their new production plants there By the way ladies and gentlemen I must announce to you that representatives of the Tennessee government were last week in Castellón visiting ceramic industries specifically in Villarreal as well to offer you the means for this relocation We are talking about relocation to the United States not a third world country What this motion does not say is that in Spain a Recovery Transformation and Resilience Plan has been approved which between aid and loans can reach up to EUR 140 billion which are barely reaching companies and which is excluding SMEs We had and have the opportunity to support this sector we have the instruments and it was a great opportunity but you and the majority that supports the government by paralysing the processing of a rule that regulates these funds are being necessary collaborators for this exclusion The ceramic sector of the province of Castellón represents the fourth largest producer of ceramic tiles in the world and the first in Europe being also the second largest exporter on the planet only surpassed by China Thus this sector places the province of Castellón in the world and therefore Spain creating wealth and many jobs as many as 17,180 direct jobs and about 50,000 indirect jobs In Castellón the rise in the price of gas and the war in Ukraine has put more than 11,000 workers into ERTE not 9000 64 of the total workforce mainly in those low cost companies that did not have the limited profit margin that they had entering into losses and presenting ERTE and worse in some cases ERE which means the destruction of employment If the government acted like Italian many ERTE could be recovered which would be very beneficial for workers and businesses From June 2021 to date the impact of the gas per square metre produced has quadrupled In the ceramic sector it already rains on wet because to increase the price of gas it is added that the clays that came from Ukraine to manufacture the products have been gone for quite some time having to resort to looking for others not so good and having to change the formulas of the mixtures to manufacture the products Ladies and gentlemen Castellón 's ceramics is Spain 's brand and it must be borne in mind that in a country as deindustrialised as Spain Castellón is one of the few provinces that has as its largest family income generator an industry such as ceramics which exports more than two thirds of its production worldwide Ladies and gentlemen one question are we prepared to risk the livelihood and the future of an entire province It 's over President",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,45.125473,-8.3319435,20,"thank president

#RivoltaErica,Mr President the conversion work of Decree Law No 50 of 17 May 2022 the so called aid decree which let us not forget takes place in a dramatic historical moment or rather falls at a particularly difficult time of a historically dramatic period which is even worse I repeat the inconvenience for the timing of the work imposed by the government and for the de facto monocameralism that I hope can soon be archived as a great constitutional force I thought my first parliamentary experience had been in a very difficult legislature the XVI with the President of the Council Berlusconi there was the earthquake of L'Aquila the great world recession started from the financial crisis of the United States the very high spread the floods the resignation of President Berlusconi in November 2011 the rise of Professor Monti with his own measures defined a few years after recession the suicides of entrepreneurs and craftsmen Well this parliamentary term is even more dramatic Many speeches have been made by colleagues in the House who have improved the text especially in favour of territories entrepreneurs and municipalities I remember the 31 million citizens receiving the 200 euro bonus I remember the one off allocation of 500 million for 2022 for self employed workers for professionals enrolled in compulsory social security schemes managed by private institutions The municipalities were allocated the residues of the Covid funds not used for facilities on the Tari and 150 million to stem the increases in energy bills temporarily giving the possibility for 2022 only to use also the proceeds of fines to stem energy costs I imagine that it will be a condition shared by all of us to be contacted every day by very worried mayors who do not know how to bear these costs how to guarantee heating in schools libraries municipal clinics municipal offices cadastral poles civic halls The mayors are already heroes as other Members have mentioned this morning but we really need to give them the opportunity to operate because they represent the institutions in trenches which every day must give convincing answers to all citizens The same dramatic phone calls come to us from the entrepreneurs who say that the bank from today does not grant them the transfer of the tax credit that they are out of 2 or 10 million that they do not make it and they skip We must give these people answers and unfortunately we do not have all the answers they need Needless to say the 110 bonus was an expansive measure because the changes that are taking place have complicated the realization of the works and even in some cases put at risk the holding of small medium and large companies really important I guess we 'll have to keep going We still come to the absurdity of the heat to energy plant You 've seen a stomachache of some unintelligible Waste management remains a disgrace to Rome and Italy as a whole due to the enormous economic environmental and image and dignity costs We need seriousness and we do not need distractions from the program of an emergency government by a majority that in another context would never have been born This week we have seen a psychodrama of which we would have gladly done without remembering that one must never fear the vote of voters and electricians I hope for more serious and responsible behaviour towards not only the institutions we represent but also and above all towards the country which is lost and with little expectations of recovery,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#deBertoldiAndrea,Mr President the Economic and Financial Document is perhaps the main instrument of economic planning so it is the document that has the least certain data because it is entirely based on prospects Before moving on to the perspectives which are all contestable and objectionable I would like to start from a reasoning on a central theme of these days these weeks and these months a theme that some friend and esteemed colleague of the Democratic Party has been called the scare of taxes I am sure that this reference was not addressed to the opposition but that the colleague evoked it at the address of some of his government allies In any case I think that there is little to joke about this issue because if there is a certain fact that reports the DEF is that for the third consecutive year the tax pressure has increased so speaking of numbers we have reached 43.5 of tax pressure on GDP which already puts us in the best to use a euphemism position in Europe and because I believe that we all know how GDP also takes account of the submerged we can also imagine that if we consider the impact of tax on the legal economy with a tax pressure of 43.5 we would find ourselves at a 49 percent that would be worth the enviable record of being the country in Europe with the highest taxation in relation to GDP So when it comes to tax scare I say that taxes are an instrument that these majorities I am referring to all those who have ruled in this and in the previous legislatures have ignored too soon and faced without the due concreteness The result is a limitation to growth and development Let us not forget that we have grown by 0.7 with the tax burden 2021 on 2020 in the previous year by 0.5 and in the year before even 0.6 So for three years as an opposition we have been witnessing policies of Count 1 Count 2 and Dragons that mean growth in the tax burden Then we are told but here we are already in perspective that thanks to the wonderful interventions included in the budget law last December in 2022 we will finally have a small drop in the tax increase We will see whether this will be the case because in our view the few denarii made available by the fiscal law for tax reduction will not allow a reduction in taxation and as has been seen mainly because of indirect taxation and VAT we will probably have a tax problem in 2022 as well On these issues I call on the majority to reason and understand that without a fiscal policy instrument we can not get out of the pandemic and international crisis It seems to me that everything that is happening in the majority and in the Government in the House where there is a continual dispute over tax reform is demonstrating what the Brothers of Italy have been saying for a long time namely that in a time of difficulty and emergency we need not a Government of national unity or better of national bickering but a homogeneous Government that knows how to give a way to the country and does not have a majority and an opposition to its internal knowing how to distinguish between who is majority and is compact and who is opposition and then loyally and consistently opposition Inside you there is everything and more and so I understand the colleague when he talks about the fear of taxes to the daughter in law so that her mother in law will understand I turn to the numbers contained in the DEF and here again there is to worry The DEF compared to the previous year 's and NADEF 's numbers shows a reduction in the growth forecast 1.8 less than expected a few months ago due to the apparent international crisis situations which stands at 2.9 percent All non-party commentators and technicians i.e. non-oppositionists I can quote Professor Baldassarre Il Sole 24 Ore today and Confindustria which by definition is always government tell us that your 2.9 percent is overestimated and that the realistic growth figure for 2022 varies between 1.3 and 1.9 percent This means that we will still remain well below 2019 GDP and that in fact the country is in stagflation that is GDP does not grow but inflation increases We do not need to be Nobel laureates or academic academic academics to understand that in a state of stagflation we must intervene in a concrete way and have the courage to make very determined policies that your majority is unable to adopt for the reasons we have repeatedly said namely because you are heterogeneous In heterogeneity we do not determine a virtuous path perhaps it determines the maintenance of our seats our seats our armchairs but it is another topic In heterogeneity the interests of Italians dear friends are not taken into account This is demonstrated by the fact that there is another issue that the DEF does not consider that of the transfer of tax credits because if it really considered it other than +3 percent other than 1.3 other than 1.9 We 're going to zero We have businesses that are failing thanks to the games of this majority and this government The first political force in Parliament the 5 Star Movement fought for tax credits But then ladies and gentlemen the government does not make you a very good figure since in the text of the bill of conversion of Decree Law No 17 which we will examine tomorrow in this House Article 29 bis provides for a paragraph in which the variations to reopen the disposals of tax credits are frustrated simply saying that the new provisions will apply to communications to the Agency of revenue made after 1 May a bit like telling a sick person that he will be given the medicine for the influence that he will take tomorrow and not for what he has already taken and which he must cure The majority therefore is not only incapable of having a precise and punctual identity path for the future of the country but is not even able to impose itself with the Government We have a Parliament that would agree on so many issues and a Government that then does what it wants it ridicules you The same is true of the resolutions we are about to vote on I am sure at least having read also the resolutions presented to the House that we will agree on many points in Parliament but they are resolutions which like any simple agenda will be destroyed by your Government by the Government that you support We will continue on a road that is not the one wanted by the representatives of the people but it is probably the one indicated by other forces and by other realities which are perhaps outside of this country In conclusion Mr President this is not a virtuous path Brothers of Italy asks for seriousness and respect for Italians If you have plans have the courage to carry them forward and force the government to do what Parliament and the majority who support it decide Otherwise we 'd better all go home,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,52.498425,-9.82932,20,mr president economic financial document perhaps main instrument economic planning document

#FaggiAntonella,"Madam President ladies and gentlemen the general state statement is the accounting document through which the Government reports to Parliament on the results of budgetary management In accordance with Articles 35 and 36 of the Law of Accounting and Public Finance the statement articulated for missions and programmes consists of two parts the balance sheet account which sets out the results of the management i.e. the actual amount of the revenue and expenditure of the State budget compared to the forecasts approved by Parliament and the general account of the assets which shows the changes in the size of the assets and liabilities constituting the assets of the State A supplementary note shall be attached to the statement of accounts for each administration For revenue the additional note sets out the results of the management The analysis of the content of the draft law shows that the management of competence achieved in 2021 a general improvement in all balances compared to the financial year 2020 In particular the net balance to be financed i.e. the difference between final revenue and final expenditure has a negative value of around 187.7 billion in 2021 an improvement of more than 83.2 billion compared to the balance recorded in 2020 Compared with the initial forecasts which indicated a negative value of the net balance of less than 193,5 billion the improvement was approximately 5.8 billion Public savings i.e. the balance of current transactions which if positive measures the share of current market resources in the financing of capital expenditure amounted to less 64.9 billion in 2021 an improvement of 40.5 billion compared to 2020 This result is determined by an increase in both current expenditure plus 22.5 billion and tax and extra-tributary revenue plus 63 billion The improvement is over 20.6 billion compared with the initial forecasts Finally the figure of the use of the financial market i.e. the difference between the final revenue and the total expenditure including those relating to the repayment of loans was less 424.4 billion in 2021 showing an improvement of 82.5 billion compared to 2020 and more than 56.3 billion compared to the initial forecasts Overall despite the continuation of the emergency by Covid 19 the results achieved with the 2021 management show an improvement for all the balances both with respect to the initial forecasts and with respect to the definitive forecasts including the deviations authorized by the Parliament The maximum limits set for the net balance to be financed and for the use of the market by the budget law for the financial year 2021 which had been indicated respectively in less € 196 billion for the net balance to be financed and in less € 483,235 billion for the use of the market were updated during the financial year by the emergency measures adopted to deal with the consequences of the epidemiological emergency by Covid 19 17.35 Following Mr Faggi rapporteur on draft law No 2682 Overall the budgetary deviation proposed by the Government to the Chambers and approved by them on 20 January 2021 with specific resolutions has re-established the

#FaggiAntonella,Mr President ladies and gentlemen I am continuing along the lines of what my colleague and co-rapporteur Senator Ferro has said As already mentioned as regards the forecasts the DEF estimates the debt to GDP ratio to fall in the current year and in the following three years Although in a context of great uncertainty linked to the war in Ukraine and inflationary pressures the growth and interest rate component should contribute to the reduction of the debt to GDP ratio as a result of sustained economic growth and high inflation which would compensate for the rise in interest rates Economic growth should benefit in particular from the impetus from the 2022 budgetary manoeuvre and the implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan In particular the DEF expects a debt to GDP ratio of 147 per cent in 2022 down from 2021 both due to the expected decrease in public sector needs and nominal GDP growth As regards the subsequent years of the forecast horizon a ratio of 145.2 per cent is expected in 2023 mainly due to lower nominal GDP growth compared to stable public sector needs In 2024 the ratio is expected to fall to 143.4 as a result of the reduction in net policy debt to 3.3 of GDP Finally the DEF provides for a debt to GDP ratio of 141.4 in 2025 This path of progressive reduction of the debt to GDP ratio should benefit from the reduction of the Treasury 's liquid stocks which in 2025 will be brought back to a level slightly higher than in 2019 To complete the budget manoeuvre 2023 2025 in the DEF the Government declares related to the budgetary decision a series of draft laws that are adhered to by the document and that colleagues themselves will be able to read Together with the DEF the Government forwarded to Parliament the report setting out the update of the re-entry plan towards the medium term budgetary objective for the necessary parliamentary authorisation The report is adopted pursuant to Article 6 of Law No 243 of 2012 the so called reinforced law implementing the principle of balance of balance sheet which provides for temporary deviations of the balance sheet balance structured by the medium term budgetary objective to be allowed in the event of exceptional events after consulting the European Commission and subject to authorisation approved by the Chambers by an absolute majority of the respective components The presentation of the report is motivated by the fact that on the basis of the new estimates available in 2021 the budgetary balance in structural terms is deteriorated by about one percentage point of GDP compared to 2020 For 2022 an improvement in the structural balance is expected to be lower than the change indicated by NADEF and in the budgetary policy document this results in a different profile particularly in 2022 than the one planned in NADEF and in the budgetary policy document in terms of speed and convergence It is also recalled that for the current year the European Commission has decided to apply the so called general escape clause which ensures a temporary suspension of budgetary rules in order to provide Member States with greater room for manoeuvre in order to bear the health costs necessary to deal with the pandemic and to counter the recessionary effects of the pandemic crisis Finally in the overall analysis of the DEF particular attention must be paid to the issue of increasing the cost of raw materials and more generally building materials with inevitable negative effects on investment and interventions in the construction sector which will inevitably reverberate also on the timing and modalities of implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan as well as on the maintenance of the macroeconomic framework The above issues have also been highlighted in the testimonies made both by the social partners and institutional actors during the round of hearings held jointly by the Senate and Chamber of Deputies budget committees In this respect in line with the considerations of the Court of Auditors it is recalled that tensions on the raw materials markets which have been going on for more than a year have become even more acute with Russia 's invasion of Ukraine Among the various aspects the most important from the point of view of the impacts on the economy is the increase in gas prices on which electricity prices depend High energy prices are reflected as well as directly on consumer prices also indirectly on production costs borne by companies the most energy intensive sectors are experiencing exceptional cost increases At this stage it is not immediate to determine what the magnitude of the increases of the various products under regime will be due to the high uncertainty linked to the outcome of the war This is also an important unknown with respect to the implementation of PNRR policies since the cost of the investment programmes indicated in the plan could also be different from the initial estimates possibly requiring a remodulation of the programme or the allocation of additional resources from the public budget a road the latter which was undertaken by the Government which in the DEF under consideration has anticipated a next measure to adapt the financing to public investment to the extent corresponding to the higher costs of the works With specific consideration to the legislation adopted so far to mitigate the impact of the expensive raw materials on the productive sector while appreciating the interventions put in place so far however cannot be considered the continuing criticality concerning for example the inadequacy of the compensation system the absence of a mechanism of contractual rebalancing with a reservation of balance the failure to recognize the problem of the finding of raw materials or the increase of prices as a cause of force majeure for the termination of the contract Possible solutions to the problems found based on the following proposals should therefore be envisaged for the work being carried out and for those of next confidence an extraordinary update of the prices in use in order to restore the contractual balance to provide for framework agreements already awarded on the basis of unup to date prices an adjustment of the projects before the conclusion of the implementation contracts to consider the possibility of providing for the termination of the contract for excessive onerosity which has occurred to assess the opportunity for certain raw materials related to specific sectors in serious crisis to provide for an extraordinary update of the prices of the materials to be put on the basis of competition in order to take account of the international economic crisis For further

#FerreroRoberta,Ferrero L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen in this heat at the end of the parliamentary term we are quickly examining the general government statement for the financial year 2021 and the provisions for the adjustment of the state budget for the financial year 2022 two very important documents that are generally somewhat neglected because they deal with figures public accounts in short boring issues However budget reporting and budgetary adjustment would need a great deal of further study as other colleagues have already pointed out but we can not do so any more today The accounting statement is the accounting document that photographs the performance of the accounts of the year just passed 2021 while the adjustment updates in mid-year the budgetary forecasts formulated under current legislation so we are talking about the development of the first half of 2022 These documents serve to verify the goodness and effectiveness of the measures put in place by the Government and then approved by Parliament In general the accounts are in order in the sense that compared to the forecasts in 2021 we have finally recorded a decrease of the expenditures pairs to approximately 2 but above all greater revenues pairs to approximately 11.7 This is certainly a positive figure for the public accounts but in my opinion a little less for the pockets of the Italians Inevitably after the closure of 2020 with the global blockade of the economy 2021 began with disproportionate increases in the costs of raw materials in February 2021 the price of iron to speak of a material that we all know began to rise dramatically as well as that of plastic and wood it is therefore obvious that a company that no longer returns with the costs eventually increases prices as happened throughout 2021 Price increases in manufacturing and processing may have taken a few months to intervene but inevitably they have arrived and reflected on consumer prices The situation has been worsened by the war which has also led to increases in the prices of energy products which have certainly made more clamour to the public but which have gone to add further to those already in place All this pressure on prices has meant that VAT revenues have increased in particular in fact the higher direct tax revenues are the first cause of the unexpected improvement in revenue Certainly this Government was able to support and help the economy in difficulty for the closures and restrictions that also characterized 2021 Let us not forget how much the League has fought to obtain for example the reductions on excise duties the containment of the effects of the expensive energy for 2022 the cancellation of the system charges measures that only according to the Government even if in a varied government of emergency has been able to obtain It welcomes the fact that the Commission has managed to put in place aid measures without further recourse to debt even the last budgetary deviation from 14.3 billion which technically is not a deviation since we have established in advance in particular the higher tax revenues for more than 10 billion is allowing the Commission to allocate these amounts to the so called Decree Law on Aid bis which will shortly be approved During 2020 deviations of around 200 billion were approved a figure virtually equivalent to the whole PNRR and then allocated to measures that in some cases as is said in the jargon have not done much Many of these billions could then be used for other support measures without further deviations This leads me to a reflection on which I personally always insist Good laws must be made written well and usable by families businesses and citizens in general When too many residues remain in the coffers of the state it means that even what could have been the most beautiful measure in the world risks becoming a pure illusion I take advantage of this explanation of vote to make a final appeal to all of you ladies and gentlemen The citizens and the productive fabric call for serious and concrete tax relief interventions the increase of salaries without the aggraviation of taxes and leaps greater delays in order to be able to pay the debitorial records the cancellation of that tax warehouse inexpensive We are also calling for VAT to be reduced on basic necessities It is necessary to be concrete to get down in reality and to overcome the distances that often exist between the citizen and the legislator All that has been said ladies and gentlemen I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets for the years we have spent together during which we have worked in harmony despite all the differences I also thank the undersecretary Sartore here present who has always been very attentive to all our requests and requests I would like to thank Mr Pesco with whom we have spent these years I have also noted the comments made by the rapporteur Senator Faggi and I therefore conclude by voting in

#RomeoMassimiliano,Mr President I would like to make a few points starting with this morning 's debate on gender Even on this request which came in these days from the Government we could talk about a technical language in the sense that for days it was said by some political forces that there was a need to provide for a deviation that could put resources in the field to help families and businesses but we were told that the deviation cannot be done because we cannot do new debt Today however the request comes from the Government and we are supporting after hearing the European Commission that the Government itself requires permission to resort to debt On the one hand they tell us we do n't have to do another debt and then the government makes a request for debt clearance It is obvious I see Senator Misses that he shakes his head that we are not doing new debt that is absolutely clear but we are not even improving compared to the higher revenues and compared to what the law provides so it does n't really change much We can play with words say that it is not a deviation but a request for authorisation of debt so it also serves the absolute majority as prescribed by the Constitution but the substance is that The higher revenues should be used to reduce public debt because there is a rule Article 17 1 a of Law 196 of 2009 which says that the higher revenues cannot be used for new interventions but in fact to improve public finance In order to be able to derogate from this law let us not reduce public debt because we rightly use these resources which should in fact reduce public debt to give aid to the population as we have always said You can use the technical language you prefer but in essence it's what we 've been saying for months and we 've been told it could n't be done In view of the narratives that these days are heard in the debates on television it is interesting to underline the fact that these 14 billion that will be available to help our citizens are not children of who knows which policies of the government or of who knows what miracle but they are children of a very simple factor with inflation and the increase of the costs of raw materials and energy substantially the State introduced more VAT there are no great miracles that is the reason And these resources must rightly be used in aid We would have expected this is a bit sorry the debate is quick and quick and we do not want to waste time on the government or the country and we would have liked a more substantive discussion on how these resources will be allocated In fact today we are faced with a delegation in white in the sense that we delegate in white to the Government which will decide essentially how to employ them We will also have little room for intervention because now that the decree is published and sent to the Senate in fact there are the month of August and then the election campaign and therefore very little can be done We would have liked to have done more We take advantage of the intervention to underline to the member of the government that since these greater resources derive substantially with inflation from an increase in VAT revenues it would be very important to use them this is the proposal that the League made to zero VAT on basic necessities This would mean meeting the people who are in difficulty and the people who need them the most,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,46.499363,-17.339327,20,mr president would like make points starting morning 's debate gender even request came days government could talk technical language sense days said political forces need provide deviation could put resources field help families businesses told deviation cannot done cannot new debt today however request comes government supporting hearing european commission government requires permission resort debt one hand tell us n't another debt government makes request debt clearance obvious see senator misses shakes head new debt absolutely clear even improving compared higher revenues compared law provides n't really change much play words say deviation request authorisation debt also serves absolute majority prescribed constitution substance higher revenues used reduce public debt rule article 17 1 law 196 2009 says higher revenues cannot used new interventions fact improve public finance order able derogate law let us reduce public debt rightly use resources fact reduce public debt give aid population always said use technical language prefer essence 've saying months 've told could n't done view narratives days heard debates television interesting underline fact 14 billion available help citizens children knows policies government knows miracle children simple factor inflation increase costs raw materials energy substantially state introduced vat great miracles reason resources must rightly used aid would expected bit sorry debate quick quick want waste time government country would liked substantive discussion resources allocated fact today faced delegation white sense delegate white government decide essentially employ also little room intervention decree published sent senate fact month august election campaign therefore little done would liked done take advantage intervention underline member government since greater resources derive substantially inflation increase vat revenues would important use proposal league made zero vat basic necessities would mean meeting people difficulty people need
