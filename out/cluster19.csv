#RafaelFernándezLomanaGutiérrez,President ladies and gentlemen the Republican Parliamentary Group has tabled a full amendment to the draft Sports Law adopted on 17 December 2021 by this Social Communist Government in the Council of Ministers and it does so because it considers that the draft is unconstitutional It is surprising that the ultra independenceist and republican left appeals to our Constitution which they openly deny and which they claimed only four months ago that it was delegitimized that is that the Constitution is good for them and that they use it for what they are interested in and always for their own benefit My group Mr VOX would like to express its opposition to this amendment as a whole because it is simply a return amendment and does not propose alternatives We believe that a new law on sport is necessary a modern renewed and advanced law that replaces the current one of 1990 We believe that the regulatory framework for sport needs to be updated that the sporting legal system needs to be provided with basic tools to meet the challenges of the coming decades and that there is a need for comprehensive and appropriate regulation to meet the needs of the current sport This does not mean that we share the full content of the project with which we are very critical and this is reflected in our partial amendments to its articulation but we believe in the need for a new law a law of consensus a law equal to what Spanish sport deserves that so many glories have given our Spanish nation The Republican Parliamentary Group does not offer alternatives simply because it has no interest in Spanish sport It is based on its amendment that autonomous competence in sport is invaded They even dare to include in their consideration of unconstitutional the Sectoral Conference on Sport They may not know that it has existed since 2008 under the name of the Interterritorial Conference on Sport and the role of coordination between the State and the Autonomous Communities And by the way to this day there is no complaint about such a conference by this ultra- left independentist and republican formation It is possible that the Republican Parliamentary Group does not want coordination between the State and the autonomous communities in this area which is why they have not said anything in the last fourteen years of the existence of this body In short accepting the fundamental theses of the Republican Parliamentary Group would mean recognizing that the Spanish State lacks the power to legislate in the field of sports which is what they would like but unfortunately for them this debate was closed long ago by the Constitutional Court Although there have been a number of rulings by the Constitutional Court in this area I can only cite three rulings The first of 1986 of 10 January The Constitutional Court held that the statutory attribution of exclusive competence in sport to the autonomous communities must on the one hand connect with the autonomous competences and on the other with the general interests of the Spanish sport as a whole whose defence and promotion will then be the responsibility of the State This ruling resolved precisely a conflict between the Generalitat de Catalunya and the possible Catalan federal participation in international competitions when the corresponding Spanish sports federation did not appear Here the Constitutional Court emphasized that the possible administrative intervention cannot be the responsibility of the authorities of the autonomous community since there are interests that are characteristic of the Spanish federated sport as a whole Second judgment 8/2012 of 18 April The High Court stated that even the powers which have been defined as exclusive to the autonomous communities must be exercised with respect to the powers which may fall to the State in accordance with the principle of territorial competences as something implicit in the system of autonomy itself And he added that the very polyhedral reality of sports matter in its different facets health education culture research physical education regulated professions or commercial legislation necessarily determines the concurrence of the various public administrations state autonomous and local Moreover in some cases it requires a comprehensive and non-fragmented approach because it involves actions in which the subject matter of sport is intertwined with another subject that is competently attributed to the State such as for example the special link between sport and health Finally in judgement 16/1996 of 1 February three Republicans the Constitutional Court declared that the State has jurisdiction over certain matters particularly education and culture which may also affect sport All this without prejudice to the specific powers conferred on the State by Law 10/1990 on Sport He added that the said law was adopted in order to manage the sport in accordance with the competences of the State administration and coordination with the autonomous communities and where appropriate with local corporations which could directly and manifestly affect the general interests of the sport at the national level The Constitutional Court recalled that this law was not the subject of any criticism by any autonomous community nor was its predecessor Law 13/1980 of 31 March In conclusion and with this we close our argument of opposition to the amendment to the entire Republican Group the Constitutional Court has made it more than clear that the exercise of the powers assumed as exclusive by the autonomous communities in their respective statutes of autonomy limits the exercise of the powers of the State From my parliamentary group VOX we will always propose policies of national unity because all Spaniards have the same rights and we must also have them in sport and because it is what Spanish sport needs and deserves against all those who want to divide us continuously in search of their own economic and partisan interest very proper to this social communist government and its independent and bi-dutar partners That is why we are going to say openly to this amendment as a whole No Thank you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,-4.179106,-16.788912,19,president ladies gentlemen republican parliamentary group tabled full amendment draft sports law

#JoaquínRoblesLópez,Mrs. Joy I do n't presume to know I 'm socratic I just know I do n't know anything The problem is that you ignore until that that you do n't know anything Look again and again he accuses us of not making proposals and my colleague Georgina and I have made hundreds of proposals in the Education Committee They are all rejected because apparently they come from the far right Time and time again they 're rejected For example we have proposed that a single State selectivity be made which you do not want because you do not want to harm the relationship you have with the separatists We 've made hundreds of proposals and they do n't admit any Then you come here and say that we do not propose of course we propose For example we propose that you comply with the Constitution that you comply with article 20.1 c of the Constitution establishing freedom of tenure And chair freedom has a double meaning according to the Constitutional Court 's ruling of May 1981 and the Supreme Court 's ruling of December 2005 Firstly the freedom of a professor says that the teacher has the right in disciplines of a dialectic nature to take the view he considers most appropriate to his loyal knowledge That is the positive point of view And the negative is that the teacher has the right to refuse to be a belt of transmission of an official doctrine You seek to impose the law of historical memory as an official doctrine and to accuse anyone who steps out of the path you mark of hate crime You do not presume to be a Democrat because this has nothing democratic And as for you being the greatest exponent here of what the Spanish people apparently want I 'm going to show you a small chart so you can see how the polls are The Spanish people are beginning to turn their backs on them now and I assure you that when we have powers of government we will change teaching and for good You have been indoctrining or trying to indoctrinate not teachers teachers conform to the agendas and according to your ideology We are not going to impose any kind of indoctrination You 're talking about the parental pin Look the parental pin was invented by the UCD When the official ideology of that time was Catholic religion and morals the UCD invented parental pin giving parents the opportunity to choose another indoctrination Which you do n't do which forces everyone to go through the stone of gender ideology LGTBI laws historical memory etc So do n't tell me stories I already know them all because I 've been teaching for many years Do n't tell me stories Minister Parental pin is a right of parents recognized in paragraph 27.3 of the Constitution That is why we take LOMLOU to the Constitutional because it violates constitutional requirements which you have already done at least three times so we know about our complaints to the Constitutional Court You tell us about the Agenda Spain The Agenda Spain is a very general document Whenever you want I will explain to you what our educational project is and what we intend to do with education And I repeat it for the umpteenth time What we are trying to do is to put all Spaniards on an equal footing that there should be no evidence of selectivity that everyone should study the same that there should be no different curricula depending on where one is born or that there should be no different curricula depending on whether one is studying in the public in concert or in the private To study the same in Andalusia as in Catalonia And by the way left wing gentlemen who end the betrayal that you are committing in Catalonia against the most disadvantaged classes which are those who have Spanish as their usual language and are adding to it a difficulty because you are forcing them to immersion in Catalan Here everything is presented as very beautiful and apparently this is for them to learn two languages so that they are bilingual No that 's not true This is to make a non-existent homeland based on ethnolinguistic criteria And you 're consenting So please do n't lecture me and insult me by saying that I presume to know a knowledge I do n't have Philosophy means that one seeks knowledge and if one seeks it it is precisely because one does not have it You as Santiago Abascal said this morning are not a philosopher you are a sophist because you have a knowledge or you think you have a knowledge that is useless and you even ignore it,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,1.677535,-18.970516,19,mrs. joy n't presume know 'm socratic know n't know anything

20.1 c constitution establishing freedom tenure chair freedom double meaning according constitutional court 's ruling may 1981 supreme court 's ruling december 2005 firstly freedom professor says

#CirianiLuca,CIRIANI FdI Mr President I am speaking on this article and in general on all the articles that we have voted very hastily because it concerns perhaps the most important part of the draft law namely the reform of the MSC I believe I have heard in this House and outside this House on television over the past few years that someone has called for the long 30 year war between politics and the judiciary hundreds of vibrant complaints from colleagues especially from the centre right on the political use of the judiciary and on the policy that came into the investigation to strike opponents How many times have we complained about this and how many times have we denounced the fact that politics had to regain a role and dignity knowing how to respond and reform justice Well in the end protests about the political use of the judiciary about currentism about career investigations that then result in nothing have produced nothing indignation produces nothing because we are voting for a reform that is little more than hot water The heart of politics in the judiciary stems from the fact that there is politics within the Supreme Council of the judiciary So if we do not eliminate politics within the Supreme Council of the judiciary everything else is completely useless We must be aware of this especially you who have often denounced the attacks of the judiciary on politics since the time when President Berlusconi received a guarantee notice in Naples in 2007 just after taking office as President of the Council I wonder what has been the use of all these years of political battle if then to the test of the facts the reforms that are taking place and voting are little more than hot water The problem is that if you do not introduce the draw all the other formulas you can invent do not serve and avoid the currentism I do not say that as Dr Palamara said at the hearing both in the Justice Commission and in the Anti-Mafia Commission where he stated that only the draw can interrupt block and defeat the cancer of politics within the judiciary in the form of a current This reform that you are voting for does not serve this purpose because the CPMP will continue with the formulas that you have chosen with the instrument of politics to promote careers and to designate appointments and will continue always with the instrument of politics within the judiciary not to hit with disciplinary sanctions those magistrates who do their job not for the sake of truth but for the sake of political faction Therefore I repeat once again our vote is in favour of this amendment but contrary to the articles because unfortunately with great bitterness we find that so many years of battle have not really served anything Once again I repeat that if we do not intervene in politics within the MSC politics will continue to radiate from the Supreme Council of the judiciary in all prosecutors because they will be convinced that they have once again won the battle against politics and can once again unpunishedly play their role not as magistrates but as political agents and partisans with the certainty that they are safe and that no one will ever be able to strike them This is the battle we have waged for so many years and we cannot escape now that there is finally a chance to give a signal,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President I rise to vote in favour of Amendment 1.30 Coming into the substance of the proposal today the Junta for elections and parliamentary immunity has a peculiarity compared to the other Juntas having a very particular task that is to decide on the election of one senator instead of another in the case of disputed elections or when there are appeals It is a matter of deciding on arrest authorisation to use telephone interceptions and other extremely sensitive issues The Rules of Procedure currently in force today very wisely provide that the Assembly for elections and parliamentary immunity unlike the others cannot be a place where senators enter and leave and where a senator can be removed from the position of rapporteur on one of these important measures this in order to prevent the Junta which has very delicate functions someone says courts someone says parajurisditional where in any case it is not decided in the last instance because ultimately it decides the Assembly but we work on issues such as arrests and legitimacy of election become a political instrument in the hands of the Leaders group who have well understood all our esteem starting with our own whereas today it should be an instrument that is based on the law rules and defence of the prerogatives of the Senate rather than of the individual senator While it has its justification to conform to the rules of the standing committees for example the junta for the Rules of Procedure ensuring that if there are passages from one group to another the representation always respects the current conformation of the parliamentary groups in this case the principle of faithfully representing the parliamentary group as it is in the Senate assembly as a whole should fall because there is a much stronger principle that is that it must be decided on the basis of law Imagine what would happen if a rapporteur who had to intervene in the matter of arrest did not comply with his group 's expectations he could easily be expelled from his group and perhaps then re-entered after a week so that the Group would not lose this senator either in order to assign the position of rapporteur to another senator who is faithful to the Group 's indications Since these are such sensitive issues choices must be made according to science and conscience and not by group discipline which is very useful in general parliamentary discipline I therefore reiterate my request for a secret vote recalling yet another detail the rapporteurs for the election and confirmation of the senators of the various regions are chosen by a random mechanism established by the Rules of Procedure In this way we overcome this randomness that is extremely opportune because obviously a senator member of the Junta can be of one party or another and in the Regions unpredictable problems emerge and it is better to unpredict otherwise we risk having also in this case a pilotage of the rapporteurs of the individual Regions and this would really go against the principles of thirdness of fidelity to the law and to the science and to the consciousness that should be the fundamental principle of the work of the Junta for the elections and the immunity,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-1.1755127,-25.80687,19,mr malan fdi mr president rise vote favour amendment

#MalanLucio,Mr President I would like to briefly supplement the written report With regard to the details which are certainly of interest in the examination of this document I briefly summarize the issue This is the request for the use of conversation intercepts in which one of the parties is Senator Siri The court 's order requires the use of all of them but has not requested the authorization as it is clearly not usable of the interceptions that occurred after the registration of Senator Siri 's suspects in the register The Junta considered by majority to consider clearly not random the phone calls after the first two which took place on the same day because from the latter it was clear that there was a frequency in the conversations between the lawyer Arata the one whose telephone equipment was intercepted and Senator Siri It was therefore clear that continuing to intercept Arata 's phone Senator Siri 's conversations would also be intercepted Therefore the Junta considered them not random and consequently classified these conversations as an indirect interception but in the knowledge that it was a matter of intercepting a senator 's phone calls which obviously is contrary to Article 68 of the Constitution As for the interceptions of the first two phone calls which it must be said in passing intervened when the Senator was not yet Undersecretary office that will assume about a month later and on the same day in May 2018 the Junta has found that in addition to the requirement of the randomness of the capture itself must exist also that of the necessity The judgment n. 188 of 2010 of the Constitutional Court specifies that establishing the necessity of the use of interceptions for the purposes of the continuation of investigations is the responsibility of the judicial authority but it has the duty to represent this necessity to the Chamber of belonging of the parliamentarians that is intercepted emphasizing that the latter in this case the Senate must be able to ascertain from the examination of the request that the requirement of the absence of persecutory intent and that of the necessity of the act motivated in terms of non implausibility It has to be said that in the same document of the court of Trapani it is stated that it has transmitted all the findings emerged in the context of the procedure in relation to the case relating to the amendment promoted by Paolo Arata and supported by Senator Siri in his capacity then that of Undersecretary of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport Therefore there is even a contradiction in the document itself which says that even without these new interceptions the court was already in possession of everything that was necessary while in another verse it does not give sufficient motivation going beyond what the same document states in its need Therefore the proposal approved by the Assembly of Parliamentary Elections and Immunities is to reject the request for the use of all conversations with two different reasons for the first two the lack of necessity and as regards subsequent ones non-occasion,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President I shall be very brief It has been argued that these opinions are not expressed because among the accusations there is that of the threats aimed at disturbing the activity of an administrative body in this case the prefect of Modena Let 's see what these threats would be because undoubtedly the threats as the penal code describes them are different from the expression of an opinion What are the threats According to the prosecutor the pressure and threats would consist as I read from the report in the presentation of statements to the judicial authority combined with parliamentary actions Is trusting the judicial authorities and exposing what is happening to them interpreted as a threat I remember that the latter is the threat of unjust damage otherwise even saying that it is being sued would be a threat An exposure to the judicial authority would be a threat of unjust harm and would imply the view of the judicial authority as a sort of armed gang at the service of Senator Giovanardi The other threats would be those of parliamentary action I would say that it is difficult to say what is more parliamentary than parliamentary action Summing up exposed to the judicial authority parliamentary actions and the other threat would be a press conference in which the senator would say plague and horns of the prefect You 'll have the right to say it then if you make false or unfounded accusations it 's another matter A Member will have the right however not only to express his opinion but to do so with a view to the judicial authorities and press conferences If the press conference is considered to be a threat of unjust harm as Senator Quagliariello said earlier we could all be accused by doing a minimum of activity A further threat would be specific press conferences to criticize the work of the prefecture Of course if there had been something unfair in these criticisms such as slanders it would be another matter To think that exposing making press conferences parliamentary actions and exposed to the judicial authority is a crime other than the crime of opinion could lead very far and totally limit the activity of a Member who simply has to come here vote say nothing or say good of everyone and not work when he believes that there are unjust actions against in this case an important company with 100 employees Among other things in essence it has been seen that Senator Giovanardi has always been right even before the judicial authority I therefore believe that there should be no doubt in voting as the Brothers of Italy will do in favour of the rapporteur 's proposal freeing the indisputability as expressed by Senator Giovanardi,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-1.5681103,-25.329967,19,mr malan fdi mr president shall brief argued opinions expressed among accusations threats aimed disturbing activity administrative body case prefect modena let 's see threats would undoubtedly threats penal code describes different expression opinion threats according prosecutor pressure threats would consist read report presentation statements judicial authority combined parliamentary actions trusting judicial authorities exposing happening interpreted threat remember latter threat unjust damage otherwise even saying sued would threat exposure judicial authority would threat unjust harm would imply view judicial authority sort armed gang service senator giovanardi threats would parliamentary action would say difficult say parliamentary parliamentary action summing exposed judicial authority parliamentary actions threat would press conference senator would say plague horns prefect 'll right say make false unfounded accusations 's another matter member right however express opinion view judicial authorities press conferences press conference considered threat unjust harm senator quagliariello said earlier could accused minimum activity threat would specific press conferences criticize work prefecture course something unfair criticisms slanders would another matter think exposing making press conferences parliamentary actions exposed judicial authority crime crime opinion could lead far totally limit activity member simply come vote say nothing say good everyone work believes unjust actions case important company 100 employees among things essence seen senator giovanardi always right even judicial authority therefore believe doubt voting brothers italy favour rapporteur 's proposal freeing indisputability expressed senator giovanardi
#FerreroRoberta,Mr President ladies and gentlemen this very important measure acts in a simple way on our Constitution but it adds a fundamental piece a subject which is always a little neglected by these classrooms but which is so important for mental and physical well being Let 's talk about sports It should be remembered for those who listen that the only article in this draft Constitutional law goes to add these words to Article 33 of the Constitution The Republic recognizes the educational social and promotional value of the psychophysical well being of sport in all its forms I have always supported him and I have already supported him on several occasions in this House As a former cyclist passionate about this complete sport that gives wellness to the body and spirit today I say finally Finally this step is being taken in the right direction It is recognizing the value of sport of all sports that are a real touch for the physical and mental health of citizens Everyone should practice a sport Sport is a master of life In cycling the ascent teaches that in order to reach the summit you have to commit You have to be stubborn We must also suffer and thus reach the goal which is also satisfaction and satisfaction Then comes the descent You taste freedom but only after you have conquered it with the ascent Those who practice competitive sport know that practice teaches a method sport becomes discipline teaches to be part of society Team sports practiced since the young age teach to be an active part of a group of people with a common goal and so called individual sports teach to belong to a community that sharing the same passion also shares the principles Those who practice sports develop an exceptional physical strength and in any case a lower propensity to illness In fact people with health problems often find sports a valuable ally to overcome them thus making less and less use of pharmaceutical care Finally I would like to mention sports in disability I had the honour of meeting a beautiful girl who is no longer there today Sara Stealto Piedmontese who had made sport in disability her mission of life He also met Minister Stefani Sara had a weak heart which caused her some problems but with sport she accompanied the disabled Bringing the culture of sport into disability had also surpassed his disability Sport made her a strong person not a sick person With his Giro d'Italia solidaritye about fifty stages with arrival in Turin he brought this message throughout Italy bringing so many disabled people closer to sport Today Sara is gone but she would have been happy to see this passage that we are making here in the Senate today For this reason with the commitment to continue the valuable work that Sara was doing today I firmly thank Parliament for this important initiative which must be a first step in promoting sport at all levels and giving the right importance and dignity to sports practice,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#BalboniAlberto,Balboni FdI Mr President this amendment aims to limit the excessive discretion of the Supreme Council of the judiciary through which the weight of current and ideological membership penetrates balancing the judgment and exposing the decisions of the MSC to the censorship of the administrative judge In fact it seems appropriate to make greater use of the criterion of seniority making it not residual as this rule does but at least competing with that of attitudes and merit This is not a return to the past but to take into account the experience gained on the ground together with merit and not separately from it The management of a judicial office requires not only the possession of technical baggage which is verified only through technical and theoretical tests reserved for the High School of the judiciary but also and above all ability to manage relations with all the interlocutors of the administration of justice and control of the decision making processes that only a fruitful and proven experience is able to assure With this amendment we are therefore thinking of reducing the discretionary power of appointments and further enhancing that of seniority,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,1.0877821,-26.149837,19,balboni fdi mr president amendment aims limit excessive discretion supreme council judiciary weight current ideological membership penetrates balancing judgment exposing decisions msc censorship administrative judge fact seems appropriate make greater use criterion seniority making residual rule least competing attitudes merit return past take account experience gained ground together merit separately management judicial office requires possession technical baggage verified technical theoretical tests reserved high school judiciary also ability manage relations interlocutors administration justice control decision making processes fruitful proven experience able assure amendment therefore thinking reducing discretionary power appointments enhancing seniority

especially within the Ministry of Justice the Constitutional International and other bodies In article 5 which as we know is an article of delegation and is not immediately preceptive at a certain point it is said in the letter h of paragraph 1 that one of the objectives that the Government will then have to pursue with the legislative decree is to reduce the number of magistrates out of role However does it not say how much 1 2 percent 10 percent 50 percent or 100 percent No one can know It seems to me to be too broad a delegation which leaves excessive discretion to the Government which may feel that it has fulfilled this delegation even by reducing by a few units the number of magistrates out of office Ladies and gentlemen think that in the Ministry of Justice only one of all the top roles is held by an official who is not a magistrate They 're all magistrates I believe that if a young man wants to be a magistrate he studies to become a magistrate he wins the magistrate 's contest it is right that he should go to be a magistrate If you want to be a public official within the Ministry there is a special career for this The magistrates must be the magistrates also because unfortunately we live a chronic lack of the role of the judiciary If I may Mr President I would also like to explain at the same time the next amendment 5.16 because it is another case of someone who is more and more equal than others We know that there has been an important battle in the House on this subject unfortunately lost We know that the out of role magistrate adds the emoluments he perceives as a magistrate he continues to perceive them even while he is out of role to the allowances he receives for the function he is going to perform within the Ministry or the other body he adds the two incomes This is an absolutely unacceptable privilege How many times in this House have we heard the rhetoric about people who do not arrive at the end of the month rightly to rightly criticize the excesses the golden pensions the salaries of politicians And today that we have the opportunity to give a small cut and to make a moralizing action all against All opposed even those who wanted to open Parliament up like a can of tuna silent and silent against this shameful privilege Quiet and mute so that the approval of this amendment can never create some disturbance in the government and you go to vote a few months before and 100 and more that you have returned in four or five Then shut up and mute about everything even about an obvious and unacceptable injustice like this We say something very simple the magistrate who wants to go out of office it is he who decides to go chooses whether to continue to take the salary as a magistrate or whether to take the compensation provided for the role he goes to play Adding them together is really unacceptable Those who vote against this amendment in my humble opinion should in future avoid certain contradictory rhetoric even

#BalboniAlberto,Mr President now begins the examination of the articles which in theory should remedy the deplorable phenomenon of the so called revolving doors They are magistrates who are candidates for elections or who take on government roles or in any case important positions within executive bodies of political significance The amendments tabled by Brothers of Italy to this and subsequent articles all aim it is useless to go into detail at a very clear objective As I said in general debate the magistrate who decides to apply or takes positions within political bodies is in our opinion forever stripped of that role of impartiality which should ensure that all citizens subject to a judgment are treated equally When we go to court it says The law is the same for all It is clear that a magistrate who has applied and stood up even if not elected has taken on a political label and can no longer have an image of impartiality In our view whether he is elected or not he must no longer return to a judicial function he can carry out other functions within the judicial system but not a judicial one Or it can be put out of place and carry out off duty duties but I repeat it no longer has to perform judicial functions neither judges nor investigators All our amendments are aimed at this In order for the judiciary to regain credibility it is necessary to give a sign of discontinuity with regard to what has taken place to date There is no point in denying that unfortunately the scandals in which the judiciary has recently been involved have shaken public opinion so much so that all those who have to appear before a judge rather than wondering if he is one who reads the papers prepared and balanced the first thing they wonder is what political idea he has and whether they having a different idea from the judge run the risk of being discriminated against because of this opinion We therefore want to give a clean cut with the past if one has the vocation of the magistrate do so To talk about me even if I never do that as a boy I would have liked to do the contest in the judiciary and maybe I also had the skills to do it given the results I got on the bar exam but I chose to be a lawyer because I wanted to do politics Since I was a boy I had this disease and knowing that in order to make politics I should not have been in a position to be criticized I did not want to be a magistrate but a lawyer precisely because I wanted to make politics Brusio PRESIDENT The debate is closed Ladies and gentlemen please leave the House quiet so that Senator Balboni can speak I also say this to the representative of the Government Balboni FdI Mr President since these are completely different functions the magistrate must be a magistrate and the politician must be a politician If the magistrate suddenly gets electrocuted on the road to Damascus leave the judiciary and will always be able to enroll in the legal order,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,0.88347965,-24.775019,19,mr president begins examination articles theory remedy deplorable phenomenon called revolving doors magistrates candidates elections take government roles case important positions within executive bodies political significance amendments tabled brothers italy subsequent articles aim useless go detail clear objective said general debate magistrate decides apply takes positions within political bodies opinion forever stripped role impartiality ensure citizens subject judgment treated equally go court says law clear magistrate applied stood even elected taken political label longer image impartiality view whether elected must longer return judicial function carry functions within judicial system judicial one put place carry duty duties repeat longer perform judicial functions neither judges investigators amendments aimed order judiciary regain credibility necessary give sign discontinuity regard taken place date point denying unfortunately scandals judiciary recently involved shaken public opinion much appear judge rather wondering one reads papers prepared balanced first thing wonder political idea whether different idea judge run risk discriminated opinion therefore want give clean cut past one vocation magistrate talk even never boy would liked contest judiciary maybe also skills given results got bar exam chose lawyer wanted politics since boy disease knowing order make politics position criticized want magistrate lawyer precisely wanted make politics brusio president debate closed ladies gentlemen please leave house quiet senator balboni speak also say representative government balboni fdi mr president since completely different functions magistrate must magistrate politician must politician magistrate suddenly gets electrocuted road damascus leave judiciary always able enroll legal order
#IannoneAntonio,IANNONE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen as we have already done in the Chamber of Deputies and in the 7th Commission to the Senate I preannounce the positive and convinced vote of Brothers of Italy on the measure under discussion amending Article 142 of the single text of the Royal Decree of 31 August 1933 No 1592 Time passes goes on and the needs of university students change The measure allows university students to enroll in two faculties at the same time We fought in the House of Deputies in our capacity as a modern and responsible opposition which is never against the nation but is able to offer its contribution to improve all measures We welcome the recognition of certain principles which we strongly supported I am referring in particular to two of them First of all it is very important to have included during the examination of the provision in the Chamber the high artistic musical and choreutica AFAM As we have always argued academies and conservatives must have a fundamental recognition as well as universities as well as institutions of high musical and Korean artistic formation This strengthening aimed at increasing the comparability of AFAMs with universities is in our political project that concerns education Then we find the article that deals with the right to study establishing that those who subscribe to two courses at the same time can benefit from the same tools and services provided for a single registration We believe that there is a common sense in avoiding too many burdens in an area where funds as we know are all too often inadequate We also agree very strongly when Article 4 states that it is not possible to enrol in courses which require special application and concentration as in the case of the medical faculty for example It is clear that we have different courses for which special attention is needed to monitor registrations Our concern was that the possibility of enrolling in two courses was all without any difference this would obviously not reward the meritocracy and the seriousness of a study with reference to special courses in which certainly one cannot lose concentration In the light of Article 4 therefore we have basically approved and accepted this amendment according to which the Ministry of the University by decree heard the National University Council CUN and the Conference of the Rectors of Italian Universities CRUI important bodies regarding the university will have to monitor courses that require compulsory attendance This is very important and the agenda that we presented to the House was also closely linked to this speech The vote of the Brothers of Italy Group will be in favour because we believe that this measure offers opportunities to university students and represents another piece to build our university to ensure that young people are no longer forced to emigrate abroad and put their strength and brains at the disposal of our nation,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-0.28066337,-20.090366,19,iannone fdi mr president ladies gentlemen ladies gentlemen already done chamber

#SaponaraMaria,SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to thank the Minister for the presence and constant involvement of Parliament Thank you too for your presence to our secretary Ladies and gentlemen I am very happy today because in recent times every time a debate on students has been held it has been to impose various restrictions on them caused by the fight against the pandemic Today however with pleasure we can say that we turn to the students with an opening order which abolishes the prohibition of contemporary enrolment at two different universities It is therefore beyond an obsolete provision of nearly 90 years ago a royal decree of 1933 which as the previous speaker has already told me provided for this prohibition In this regard the League was among the first to submit a legislative proposal to amend this rule After this last passage to the Senate we hope that from next academic year every student can enroll at the same time in two different courses of degree master 's degree and master 's degree also at several universities schools and higher institutes under special order institutions of high artistic formation musical and choreutica This opportunity has long been demanded by students professors academics and the world of work who trusted in a system that focused on the interdisciplinaryity of knowledge to create professional figures that would respond more adequately to the increasing complexity of the world of work With the overcoming of the logic of specialization in a single sector not only does our country align itself with most European countries but it offers students the concrete opportunity to make their training more flexible In addition with regard to post graduate and post graduate three year guidance the measure will allow students not to lose a year for having made a choice of wrong or hasty studies Now the Minister of University and Research will have to regulate the modalities for the simultaneous registration the conditions for obtaining double or joint final qualifications between Italian and foreign universities as well as the modalities for the simultaneous registration of two different university courses with access to a number programmed at national level We hope that the deadlines set for starting next year will be respected in the best way possible and that there will be no short circuits in the practical application of the rules and their coordination Another important innovation introduced by this bill will be the implementation of the student 's electronic file It is a fundamental tool that will allow access through the public digital identity system SPID or the electronic identity document to all documents of the career of each student in order to ensure transparency and ensure an effective simplification of every bureaucratic practice especially when it is necessary to dialogue with several Italian and foreign faculties and universities We therefore consider it very important to have provided for mechanisms in this text which also allow economically disadvantaged students to have access to double enrolment in order to guarantee students who are capable and worthy even if they lack the means the right to reach the highest degrees of their studies providing for instruments capable of making this right effective 17.28 Following SAPONARA Moreover it has obviously been corrected to provide that the student who is enrolled at the same time as two courses applies the total or partial exemption of the payment of the annual all inclusive contribution for both enrolments This measure is a way of promoting and promoting interdisciplinary learning with a view to accessing less sectoral and distinct knowledge facilitating the interconnection between the scientific and humanistic sectors a fact that will necessarily involve a revision of the educational systems of universities precisely in order to provide for less rigidity and the development of greater interdisciplinaryity Madam Minister these days I have received several e-mails from students who asked when the measure under consideration would be passed so today we give these young people the opportunity to form themselves The draft law under consideration is an encouragement precisely to give our young people the opportunity to learn those disciplines that will allow them to enter the world of work in an appropriate and also competitive way In conclusion with the approval of this measure we also take a further step towards the implementation of our tertiary education system and of what has been planned for a long time in many European countries Trusting that the entire Shareholders Meeting shares this text I announce the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo

#SaponaraMaria,Mr President ladies and gentlemen the representative of the Government the Memory Travel Fund very briefly is the title of the bill that we are called upon to dismiss in this House today after the examination in the 7th Commission From the title the bill may appear or suggest something fascinating and romantic but in reality it intends to strengthen Law No 211 of 20 July 2000 with which the Day of Memory was established in memory of the extermination and persecution of the Jewish people and the Italian military and political deportees in the Nazi camps To understand and understand it better it is worth briefly retracing the stages that led to the establishment of a day dedicated to the memory of the shoah a Hebrew term by which the extermination of the Jews victims of the Nazi genocide is indicated identified on January 27 as the day of the liberation of the concentration camp in Auschwitz It is from 1960 with a renewal of school programs that we begin to embark on the path of the recovery of memory and the historiographical debates on subjects of deportation and shoah take on some importance also for the resonance aroused by important trials in Germany against the Nazi executioners and the success of audiences of fundamental literary testimonies on the shoah such as the books of Primo Levi and Anna Frank which become real classic beds and studied also in schools The ministerial decree of 4 November 1996 n. 682 dictated changes to the history programs in schools of every order and grade broadening the attention on the facts of the twentieth century and giving the start from that moment to a particular attention to the racial laws to the relations between fascism and deportation to the history of the concentration camps leading to the development of numerous projects that often end with travels in the places of memory and in the aforementioned fields From then on the use of testimony has become a fundamental element in the teaching of the shoah The encounter with the witness has always been fundamental because it creates a huge empathy and gives students the opportunity to touch history and to embark on a path of knowledge capable of affecting their lives in a lasting way trying to avoid the risk of emotion passing and remaining nothing of what has been heard and learned Finally in 2000 the institution of Memory Day with Law No. 211 of 2000 has encouraged more and more school initiatives the protagonists of which have often been the survivors with their stories of imprisonment Mr President I am sorry but there is a lot of confusion this is something I think everyone is interested in,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,-3.6162543,-21.381525,19,mr president ladies gentlemen representative government memory travel fund briefly title bill called upon dismiss house today examination 7th commission title bill may appear suggest something fascinating romantic reality intends strengthen law 211 20 july 2000 day memory established memory extermination persecution jewish people italian military political deportees nazi camps understand understand better worth briefly retracing stages led establishment day dedicated memory shoah hebrew term extermination jews victims nazi genocide indicated identified january 27 day liberation concentration camp auschwitz 1960 renewal school programs begin embark path recovery memory historiographical debates subjects deportation shoah take importance also resonance aroused important trials germany nazi executioners success audiences fundamental literary testimonies shoah books primo levi anna frank become real classic beds studied also schools ministerial decree 4 november 1996 n. 682 dictated changes history programs schools every order grade broadening attention facts twentieth century giving start moment particular attention racial laws relations fascism deportation history concentration camps leading development numerous projects often end travels places memory aforementioned fields use testimony become fundamental element teaching shoah encounter witness always fundamental creates huge empathy gives students opportunity touch history embark path knowledge capable affecting lives lasting way trying avoid risk emotion passing remaining nothing heard learned finally 2000 institution memory day law no. 211 2000 encouraged school initiatives protagonists often survivors stories imprisonment mr president sorry lot confusion something think everyone interested
#SaponaraMaria,Mr Saponara rapporteur While it is true that the direct listening of the witnesses who survived that hell is fundamental in order to move the consciences of the young it is equally true that with the passing of the years those same witnesses are less and less so the direct vision of the places becomes even more important in order to keep alive the memory of the facts From this last consideration came the need to offer students a greater opportunity to visit them because those places can speak they can tell the tragedy of those who have suffered enormous atrocities in them and of those who while surviving them are no longer there It is therefore the aim of the bill today in this House to make it easier for young people to reflect on the sad chapter of history The draft law consists of only one article modulated according to the indications of the opinion of the 5th Commission This article announces the above mentioned Law No 211 of 20 July 2000 with the establishment at the Ministry of Education of a fund with a budget of one million euros for each of the years 2022 2023 and 2024 to promote and encourage while respecting school autonomy the memory trips to Nazi concentration camps for students of the last two years of secondary schools of second degree in order to mature the civic consciousness of the new generations with respect to the extreme suffering suffered by the Jewish people during the Nazi persecution of the shoah It will therefore always be up to the Ministry of Education with its own decree to be adopted within ninety days of the entry into force of the law to define the modalities of use of the resources and to determine the type of financial expenses On the other hand the Ministry of Economic Affairs has the task with its own decree of making the necessary changes in the budget As rapporteur for the measure I presented an agenda to the Commission accepted by the Government with the invitation to assess the need to include in the implementing decree the increase if possible in the years of this fund and to ensure that at least 40 of these resources are allocated primarily to the organization of memory travel by secondary schools of second degree located in areas disadvantaged or characterized by the presence of students in a state of social distress and finally to provide forms of awareness to the organization of memory travels and other forms of deepening of the history of the shoah addressed to schools that have not organized such trips in the previous three years This in summary is the content of the bill Before concluding Mr President I would like to thank Mrs Daisy Pirovano who as soon as she signed the bill showed great sensitivity to this issue and of course the entire Lega Group who signed it I thank the President of the 7th Commission Senator Riccardo Nencini and all my fellow Commission senators who have supported and shared the bill and its process Finally I would

#OstellariAndrea,Madam President ladies and gentlemen I will be much shorter than President D'Alfonso Of course President D'Alfonso referred to the European agenda but in my opinion there was not only the European agenda but there was also the agenda of our country This is a measure that has been in progress for a long time and we have been able to hear many experts at the hearing in the course of which we thank for their input I believe that by putting the country at the centre this reform has taken a step forward I have to say this for everyone beyond the demands and political indications of the various groups We put at the centre the taxpayer citizen first of all and then the country system which however is based around a tax process that needed some reforms This is the best reform we could have achieved today and brought to this House at this stage I think that finally the tax judiciary can be and will certainly be more independent it will be dedicated to the tax process without forgetting of course who up to now has provided their service and role within the complicated world that we are going to modify As a citizen even before I was a politician and a representative I am happy to be in front of this reform today because before that something was obviously wrong We obviously continue with the path of changes to allow our country to be at the forefront also compared to other European systems and not only Madam President starting with the conclusion as a lawyer but we have also talked about it in the Commission I believe that more objectives have been achieved and I would like to emphasise some of them as fundamental to the success of the future tax process for all those involved The testimonial before it actually did n't exist Today thanks to the work of all of us the testimonial will finally exist and within the tax process will be a useful tool not only for the magistrate but also for all parts of the trial and for the taxpayer citizen Another important point is the principle of reversal of the burden of proof a delicate principle on which we have discussed and on which we have all found ourselves seeking a sharing through the formulation of an amendment that has been accepted and this to the advantage not of some political part but in this case of the taxpayer it will therefore be the State to have to try more and this must also be specified and emphasized its claim towards the citizen I believe that the commitments entered into with the agendas are also important and must be emphasised And I imagine that will be the subject of an explanation of vote by the Groups Among these I recall for example those who commit the Government I do not know now when it will be time to do so to see recognized protection not only at the stage of the trial but also at the earlier stage of the investigation because something needs to be settled there today too All this system ultimately serves to be more attractive as a country also towards those who look at us from outside and who for example want to come to us to invest But above all it will be in defense of those who today make system in our country invest already in our country and here they intend to stay Then for them just for the citizens and for our country system we carry on this reform and try to improve it also on those points on which we have found a less sharing but still an acceptance through the agendas that we have approved,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,4.2174997,-24.603403,19,madam president ladies gentlemen much shorter president

#PillonSimone,Mr President Gramsci in the Justice Papers he wrote that the moment of hegemony is essential in his state conception and in the valorisation of a cultural front It can be said that the parties are the computers of the new integral and totalitarian intellectualities To achieve hegemony we need to conquer the areas of greatest cultural influence the school in all its degrees the newspapers the magazines the library activity the educational institutions as well as of course the judiciary These are the Quaderni from Antonio Gramsci 's prison they were written about a hundred years ago The school according to Gramsci together with newspapers magazines library activity and the judiciary is a tool for achieving hegemony And for Gramsci hegemony and totalitarianism are essentially the same thing except for the use of physical violence When the forces inspired by Marxism then communism then democrats then liberals today PD perform hegemony operations such as those we have heard in the intercepts between Palamara Lotti Zingaretti Minniti and many other representatives of PD they do nothing but realize a hegemonic project a strategy written in clear letters a hundred years ago We may not have read Gramsci but I assure you they did Therefore it is eager and also a little naive to take it because the actions of center right government are regularly frustrated by the action of a part of the politicized judiciary The words of Palamara about Salvini which must still be impressed even if it has nothing to do with it resound last but not least even in the last hearings of the Milan classrooms where the umpteenth trial against Silvio Berlusconi is celebrated accused last of immorality that if perhaps it is a sin is certainly not a crime But I tell my colleagues in the Movimento 5 Stars that the same situations were created in the trials against Virginia Rays and against Chiara Appandino Or addressing my colleagues in Italy Viva in trials against Renzi 's parents All trials perhaps concluded with acquittals but which have served in order to cast a shadow on the political opponent This is hegemony elimination of the opponent Totalitarianism did so with prison with the lager with the gulag with the firing squad hegemony does so with the political processes with the media demolition the ridicule of the opponent the instrumental use of education education and culture to give civil death to those who oppose liberal thought The result does n't change When and not a few someone succumbs to suicide in front of such a mass of pressure then crocodile tears flow Some leave politics others are forced to silence the system works very well The problem however ladies and gentlemen and I am addressing above all those who sit behind me is not them At the end of the day they are consistent with themselves they have been pursuing the same strategy for a hundred years The problem is us that is the other political forces Will we or will we not be able to build a regulatory apparatus capable of guaranteeing the independence of one of the most formidable powers that the Leviathan State has demanded for itself namely the judiciary To read this reform honestly ladies and gentlemen I can only respond negatively The steps were shy sometimes useless often facade Sure you could say and we 'll say that it 's better than nothing On the relationship between the judiciary and politics however we did not have the courage to be clear those who enter a party as candidates or elected persons of little importance can no longer be considered impartial Instead we still have revolving doors On the separation of careers Falcone 's words contrary to what Mr Cirinna and Mr Grasso said yesterday in the Commission are very clear and were spoken in 1991 after and not before the 1989 reform Falcone said An accusatory system starts from the assumption of a prosecutor who collects and coordinates the evidence to be reached during the debate where he represents a part in the matter Experience skills skills and preparation including technical skills are therefore needed to pursue the objective The prosecutor in the debate must not have any kind of relationship with the judge and not be as then but even today a kind of parajudice The judge in this picture stands as a neutral uninvolved figure above the parties All this contradicts the fact that having unified training and careers with interchangeable destinations and roles judges and pm are in reality indistinguishable from each other Who like me requires that they be instead two figures structurally differentiated in skills and careers is branded as an enemy of the independence of the magistrate a nostalgic of the discretion of the prosecution eager to place the PM under the control of the Executive It is truly unique that we want to confuse the differentiation of roles and the specialization of PMs with completely distinct institutional issues Instead we more than thirty years after these words still have the two figures completely indistinct and mixed Civil responsibility would be the real reform of the judiciary because it would finally bring the citizen who by profession is the magistrate so he is not a magistrate but he is the magistrate to the same level as all other citizens who do other professions but who are citizens At the end of the day this is the only profession that is in fact completely irresponsible from the economic point of view This can only fuel the risk that this irresponsibility will also involve any other profile After an acquittal after a trial carried out with intent or guilt the wrong party should pay and this does not happen Yet there is no trace of this in the reform despite the 1987 referendum that was won by 80 of the participants who were never transformed into a law That popular will has remained on paper As far as the Supreme Council of the judiciary is concerned it seems clear to me that the only solution in front of chats and dinners at the Champagne Hotel is the draw perhaps temperate The solution proposed by the reform that we are going to vote on presents tables of the electoral districts that will not be written by Parliament either but by chance by those same off the shelf magistrates whose functions we have kept essentially complacent to the currents that will certainly be felt for the definition of electoral colleges In conclusion Mr President are we satisfied No we will do better when we win the lessons next year for now we are content We have tabled amendments to this reform we have maintained them we will vote with conviction and we call on the other political forces to do the same,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#PellegriniEmanuele,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is a bit of a debate today about the reform of the judiciary and the functioning of the Supreme Council of the judiciary signed by former Minister Bonafede because during the Conte II Government this path has been blocked With this delegation we have or better we had the opportunity to put a stake and a firm point in the path of democratic reform of this country Let 's start with the reform of the judiciary Why do we need to reform the judiciary Clearly if something is wrong it must be reformed There is still someone who in opposition to certain reforms claims that things are going well and that we simply need to make some of them plain We say on the other hand that things are not going well at all There are obvious mistakes delays and distortions in the world of justice There are passages that go against the law and we as the homeland of law have a duty to eliminate errors delays and distortions We have approved the reform of the criminal process and the reform of the civil process because Europe asked us to align ourselves with the requests of the PNRR but also I have already said this and I repeat this because we were not and are not able to withstand the inefficiency of the justice machine as it stands today What is the morale of these reform steps that we have faced so far We have adopted reforms this is clear and I believe that we have come close to the goal but we have missed one last yard We have missed it in the criminal process we have missed it in the civil process and I believe we also miss it in this reform Logics of balance government and balance of powers not necessarily constitutional have led to reforms or reforms I do not question the commitment and the will of Mr Cartabia unfortunately he is not here today but there will be tomorrow which must be remembered he has brought to this House a series of measures which his predecessor and then President of the Count Council have failed to bring about and we must nevertheless acknowledge this However we cannot even keep quiet about the fact that we were and still are at a time when we could and I add more had to be done Here we move on to the other fundamental point of this measure which is the analysis of the MSC and the rules that make this body work I would like to point out that those who use the argument that those who wish to question the present rules of the MSM question the principle of independence of the judiciary are clearly aware that they are lying because nobody neither I nor my Group has ever questioned this kind of principle Too many times in an instrumental way we have seen that even if we raise this issue it is said that we are against the independence of the judiciary and therefore against the judiciary justice and law It is absolutely not true these are instrumental polemics that we refer to the sender We saw ourselves in the sedan because we simply wanted to discuss and deepen the problem but we do not question as I said before the autonomy in judging magistrates However I would like to remind you that magistrates are people like us and that as such they have talents and defects as everyone has lives and difficulties But who decides to be a magistrate let us remember that it is decided to be a magistrate has a bigger task that is to administer justice and decide the lives of people Justice is in fact administered in the name of the people and the law is the same for all these are phrases that we all know and are principles that we should all have consolidated in our pre-political baggage I remember however a professor of institutions of Roman law who in the first year of law at the first lessons told us that everyone knows that the law is not the same for everyone This is the point of tension that we must be able to deepen with these reforms and in order to ensure that justice is the same for all of us we must also affect a body such as the MSM which as I recall is a constitutionally important body and has the task of maintaining the level of the magistrates in a disciplined manner Discipline let us remember this word The strange events we have seen read and heard in the books and on the news have raised infinite doubts and reflections on the proper functioning of the MSC but we cannot do a Commission of Inquiry because when we wanted to raise this issue it was said that it could not be done So what do we do to reform the MSC Here too we take an important path we begin a legislative speech we approach the goal but also in this case we stop just a few steps I remind everyone that the MSC is a body of constitutional importance and is not ultra-constitutional Someone said that we cannot change certain rules because they are constitutional and as a jurist I say that he is completely right However I am going from a lawyer to a politician and I wonder why we have not gone to a more profound impact on this reform We have seen that if there is political will we can change everything in a short time Here is the key to everything if there is the will In conclusion Mr President I fear that for someone in here the will is not there perhaps out of laziness perhaps for convenience or perhaps for convenience What 's the moral I do not want to appear irreverent towards this Parliament but the student has applied himself but he could do more The people thank and how do they do it No longer going to vote no longer wanting to speak because as Senator Morra said nothing changes And we are all responsible for this disaffection Therefore when the instrument of direct democracy which was a flag of a considerable political part represented here is mocked even when we tried and got the people to vote on certain issues on which otherwise it could not be expressed I remember rightly that the 500,000 signatures were there I remember it for all therefore ridiculing the instrument referendary is ridiculing the people that people who with direct democracy wanted to carry on and recognize Instead by doing so even those who speak in this House denigrating the instrument of direct democracy as is the repealing referendum go against their own principles but this is a matter that the voters will decide I shall conclude Mr President Let us remember the priorities which are the unjust prisoners the rights recognized but denied in practice If we still have some dignity let 's change and let 's do it now",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,2.7389193,-24.128836,19,"mr president ladies

#PellegriniEmanuele,PELLEGRINI Emanuele L SP PSd Az Mr President it is with a misplaced sense of inadequacy that I am speaking today because the facts that are happening not far from us obviously cannot but be the focus of our attention I would also like to make a few points in the few minutes I have to present our Group 's vote on sport in the Constitution to some aspects which in my opinion are useful for the reflection of all of us The value of sport why put it in the Constitution Why put the word sport into the constitution or rather the phrase sporting activity which has been correctly stated in this legal text as it is broad and absolutely exhaustive of the value of sport We do this because we all think that sport is a fundamental value of civil life and that as such it has the full dignity of being contained within the Constitutional Charter which is the foundation of our democracy and the legislative realization of the social relations that we must recognize every day in our daily lives We insert sports activity into the Constitution because it represents essentiality sport as an acclaimed example of human valorization Sports activity as indicated in the norm that we are going to approve today is the basis of educational and social development and the promotion of psychophysical well being I quote for brevity something that is very close to my heart and that I know is very dear to the Undersecretary Vezzali whom I thank for his presence and for having attended the process of this bill Sport is one of the key moments for people who have various types of disability or who have diseases that unfortunately can in many cases be degenerative I am thinking for example of Parkinson 's disease I personally had the opportunity to meet people who are suffering from this degenerative disease and who however thanks to sport have not only delayed its effects but have even achieved exceptional sporting results of absolute first order It is precisely by thinking of these people of examples we could make countless of them that we must find one of the fundamental reasons why sport must be recognised within the Constitution Sport as I said before is to be understood in the widest possible sense and I address myself to the Undersecretary Vezzali who knows how much I care about a broad conception I am thinking of Olympic sports of which you have given great proof Undersecretary but I am also thinking of amateur sports or sports practiced by people with disabilities the recent Paralympics are an example I think about sports for the elderly for everyone I add an aspect that the Undersecretary has transmitted to us but that all our sportsmen transmit to us sport is emotion it is a fundamental step because it represents the extrinsicity of the human being We 're not just sports results we 're not just numbers we 're emotions And now more than ever considering what is happening in Ukraine we must also remember this passage being a man does not simply mean being politicians lawyers or engineers it means being emotions I believe that sport has always witnessed this in history We can cite countless examples of people who have marked history I like to remember an example all Italian who did not like to speak much but acted with his sports actions and the titles achieved I am referring to the very Italian Gino Bartali whom we know well and who in Italian history has contributed in various ways to build that something that he did not like to say Let us remember that it has helped save hundreds of lives of Jews who risked being deported so to be killed but he did n't like to advertise it because he always said that good is done but it 's not said and certain medals hang on the soul and not on the jacket I believe that this is a fundamental example of what it means to be truly sporty As I said there have been many sportsmen in history and in order to relate to what is happening to the war events that unfortunately are close in the course of history we have witnessed too many times that sport has had to suffer the effects of the misunderstanding that we human beings often fail to overcome I am thinking for example of the various boycotts during the Cold War or during the various political crises I am thinking of the sporting sanctions that have been enacted over and over again against certain states including Russia for example for various behaviors let us think of the current totally unjustified aggression From the examples of history we have to learn that sometimes sport bringing emotion also brings logic into people 's heads I believe that the emotion of a Prime Minister who today told us what is going on in his country can make us understand what is going on maybe even in the attacking country We can never and I stress this a hundred times justify war this must be clear but we must have the ability to understand Perhaps also thanks to sport which precisely allows us to be together to live together and to understand each other we will be able to understand how we have reached this point and how we can get out of this crisis which I hope will end as soon as possible With this very emotional and I hope little rhetorical spirit I announce the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group to the bill,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#PittoniMario,Mr President today the House is called upon to finally adopt at second reading draft law No 2415 of parliamentary initiative which aims to abolish the prohibition of simultaneous enrolment in several university courses and higher education This is an anachronistic ban contained in the single text of the laws on higher education referred to in the Royal Decree of 31 August 1933
