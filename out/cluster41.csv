#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Very good afternoon ladies and gentlemen We are dealing with the validation of the Royal Decree Law 12/2022 It is important that you know this ladies and gentlemen and those who listen to us because if only you had listened to the Minister of Health in her intervention anyone could believe that we are facing the validation of the Royal Decree Law 14/2021 because she has dedicated three quarters of her intervention to talking about another royal decree law which is the famous royal decree law of stabilization of the interims which has not by the way served to stabilize any interim in any case to send some of them to the street to begin with We are facing a very complex royal decree law by the circumloquies it gives It uses very complex words for very simple realities and it is actually empty of content because what we see here clearly and we have been seeing it all day is a government that is leaving and a Socialist Party united with We are in an internal war Clearly the Government is dissolving and what they are trying to do at forced marches and with little success is to launch populist measures to try to hang small medals that hold them in power a few more months because they come and tell us that with this royal decree they intend to stabilize the temporary staff of the Administration in the health sector In order for all Spaniards to know according to the government data there is 47.3 temporaryity in health care almost half of Spain 's health workers are in precarious condition and the government comes and tells us that it will solve it with this royal decree law when the reality is that the only thing that makes this royal decree law is to change the name to things You come and say that what was acting personal is now called temporary statutory personal perfect it seems that with that you would have solved it We are told that they create an obligation so that they can only be hired as temporary statutory staff for a maximum of three years which is what Spanish labour law already says which is what the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union already say which is what the rulings of the higher courts of justice of Spain already say which are recognising the illegality of temporary contracts in law fraud for more than three years What do you intend to do with this Change the name to something that already exists But the thing is even better because they say that on certain occasions it will be possible to hire people in precarious conditions only on certain occasions that is when there is a vacant position to run temporary programmes or for excessive accumulation of tasks that is if in an emergency there is a lot of work it will be possible to hire someone temporary statutory Exactly the same as it is now Exactly the same as there is now and I am going to give concrete examples the typical doctor who works in emergencies who has been covering in a precarious way a square that is never taken to competition for twenty years There are a lot of cases Minister all over Spain And this royal decree that you want to validate today continues to be allowed Moreover it expressly provides for this So it 's a shame that you 're trying to hang your medallions by deceiving the Spaniards with the idea that in the upcoming elections you 're going to be held you do n't run away from the Socialist Party or Podemos and deceived you 're going to vote again On the other hand you say from now on consequences will be established for when the Administration violates the law And when we see those consequences they mean that for those workers who are kept in a job in law fraud compensation will be paid since the adoption of this royal decree law not before And what 's the compensation Compensation of 20 days per year worked with a maximum of one year It is less compensation than that recognized by labour legislation for improper dismissals This is neither compensation nor a consequence of any kind,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,19.9441,-28.666325,41,good afternoon ladies gentlemen dealing validation royal decree law 12/2022 important know ladies gentlemen listen us

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,Thank you President Minister ladies and gentlemen What you have said here Minister tells it because you have it written because it is dictated by the script of sanchism What I 'm going to tell you has not been told by anyone to tell me it is told by common sense and my professional experience as an autonomous The essence of the royal decree that today brings to validation lies in three pillars that are the principles of this Government 's policies the lie the increase in collection and the attack on freedom Many of those who pass after me through this rostrum will show their complacency with the new system of quotation for the self employed and will speak of their goodness as if it were that balm of Fierabrás to which the ingenious hidelgo of La Mancha always referred and almost all of them will have something in common that they have neither been nor are nor will ever be self sufficient a very revealing fact As I said this royal decree revolves around three axes One the lie The Government says that the self employed regime is deficient because in the use of their freedom almost all self employed people have chosen the minimum contribution base Have you not thought that the choice of that minimum basis of assessment may be due to the fact that it is indeed a system that has many weaknesses that you are not able to offer the self employed the consolidated rights until the time of how much you are going to charge but what you have to pay I mean the certainty is given today which I 'm going to pay but not how much I 'm going to collect from pension And among other issues the various governments so far have vetoed the possibility that many self employed people could contribute on higher bases when they requested it because they were close to retirement age and little less that they have been told that they had fraudulent behaviour If a person is about fifty years old he is considering retirement and at that time he has more resources more availability less family burdens it is logical that he thinks of his retirement at that time and not when he is twenty years old but you accuse him of being fraudulent behaviors It is therefore a lie that the social security system for the self employed is deficient as a result of the choice of a minimum basis because we are also faced with a contributory system depending on what I bring I will charge So where 's the deficit As for the increase in collection I will tell you that you fall into your own trap If they say that the system is deficient because the majority of the self employed 84 are contributing to the minimum base it turns out that it will now cease to be deficient Why Because they 're going to collect more And I 'm going to give you two examples So far all those with incomes below the inter professional minimum wage in principle had no obligation to discharge the social security self employed regime and justice has been repeatedly endorsed in its jurisprudence From now on a self employed person with incomes below the minimum inter-professional wage will have to contribute approximately 30 of his disposable income Secondly what they have also done has been to increase the contribution for self employed entrepreneurs from EUR 60 to 80 And I 'll give you another piece of information At this time and under this scheme which you have just implemented retired people who are compatible with their pension and the development of an economic activity will also have to discharge the social security self employed regime with a number of payments a matter which has not been the case so far because you are obviating whether it is a regular activity an activity which is only residual and whether or not the income exceeds the interprofessional minimum wage As far as freedom is concerned I say to him that in fact it is an attack on freedom no matter how much boonist marketing the government intends to deceive and convince the self employed under that slogan of We do it for your sake The reality is that this is one of the nuclear issues of this decree that attack on the freedom of the self governing by suppressing your right to choose because you progressives ists -ists are very rights to choose on ethical and moral issues but when it comes to the right to choose on economic issues are more of the burgeoning right that is we all have to obey the Government are more of the imposition And under the pretext of protecting the self employed we find a social communist government that has always lived from the public which gives lessons to the self employed on how to plan their future Because of course the self employed despite having set up a business and making a living with their efforts have no idea how to plan their retirement Therefore they attack one of the few spaces where responsibility and individual freedom for the self employed could still be exercised which was to choose where and how to save or invest and design their retirement Because you always show hostility towards any behavior within society that involves exercising personal and individual freedom Its aim is to inculcate citizens who either in the fold or who alone will be unable to live by their own means From VOX we know that the self employed instead of imposing need transparent and reliable information certainty and legal certainty Minister if as I have said before you are not able to offer citizens the amount of consolidated social security contributions rights do you think you will be able to organise the future and pensions for the self employed Finally as regards the protective action that you have spoken about by Social Security we agree that we must protect the self employed yes but we must protect them from you from this government that has ruined thousands of them I remind you that they forced thousands of them to close their businesses through a state of unconstitutional alarm declared unconstitutional thanks to VOX 's resources They were illegally denied their right to work and have not yet been compensated as they deserve and as we have defended since VOX They behaved with them as an entrepreneur who sent a worker home without compensation Can you imagine Minister that thinking of the general interest of the Spaniards we send you and your entire government home without the right to compensation Being the goal pursued by the general interest and to save lives it would be justified for us to skip the Constitution and put you on the street That is the protection you have given the autonomous As regards the protection system there is a possibility that the self employed person will receive the cessation benefit which is when he or she has debts exceeding 150 of his or her income Do you know what you 've done Excluding from those debts that have been incurred with Finance and Social Security when many self employed today still carry debts with Social Security and Finance from the pandemic which they could not pay because they did not generate income because you forced them to close In order to complete the menu of misconceptions posed by the Government and those who dance to it water you have modified article 117 of the General Tax Law I say this to hear me from the Minister of Finance who is here and you have modified that article on the pretext that Social Security can obtain better information from the Tax Agency regarding the determination of the bases but that is a lie it is not true In the explanatory statement of the royal decree you say that they do so in relation to the special tax system of allocation of income and in the final wording of the article they have omitted the allocation of income and have left special tax regimes so that now the tax management bodies which so far could not will be able to check special tax regimes when that space was reserved for the Inspection which always gives greater and better guarantees to the taxpayer And it is that on 29 March 2021 the Supreme Court handed down a judgment which referred to abuses committed by tax management bodies that initiated proceedings on special tax regimes for which they were not entitled So by the back door we 've already amended the General Tax Law and it's all fixed All right Of course let us stress the absence of the law of transparency as to what will be the actual computable income or returns for the purpose of determining the base of contribution because what is felt after a careful reading of the text is that the self employed must contribute not for the returns of their economic activity but for all And I ask you Minister even for the supposed returns Because of course you talk about derivatives of holding participation in an entity with or without legal personality What does this mean That if a self employed person has a mechanical workshop with his brother in law for the value of the social participation he has in that entity will you impute an assumed income to him Because it is not clear in the royal decree law Are they secretly introducing a tax on the capital disguised as the highest social security contribution Careful Another pildorita When the Tax Agency initiates a verification procedure and determines that the returns declared by an autonomous person are lower than it considers this liquidation will logically refer it to Social Security so that Social Security also conforms to a new contribution base and all these do so by obviating the right of the taxpayer to seek such liquidation The self employed will therefore now have to pay the tax quota resulting from the liquidation of the Treasury and the quota resulting from the liquidation of the Social Security despite its appeal and then the courts give it the reason that is more payments And here we enter into dangerous ground on the subject of the Tax Agency because you know and if you do n't know it I tell you from my experience that tax legislation has many ambiguities and this from will be deductible those expenses necessary for the development of the activity You for example when you are going to play golf because you play golf do you see the clothing you bring today No right Another different one That is that the suit you wear could be considered as a necessary expenditure for the development of your activity as can happen to an autonomous a mason a commercial when they buy your work uniform Well that 's what you say to tax management and it sounds like Chinese I 've seen mobile phone bills fulminate to an autonomous because they picked up phone calls on Sunday Look at the level Nothing has to do with the computable performance for tax purposes of an activity with economic performance and therefore the problem for the self employed is you There is life beyond the public pension and Dad State I tell you that every article every provision every section of this rule is a deadly trap for the entrepreneur the hunt for the self employed the free citizen and the diver has begun Take care of yourselves but resist And as one singer said They played in time the lie and the truth they competed in time and the lie runs more but at the moment the truth came to the end,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,21.447886,-28.956758,41,thank president minister ladies gentlemen said minister tells written dictated script

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The debate on this law on the creation and growth of businesses has already been held in the Committee on Economic Affairs as some of the Members who have spoken before me have said and subsequently in this plenary and today we theoretically resume the debate to discuss those amendments that would modify the text that came to the Senate But I would like to point out certain issues that I think you should listen to because I would dare to say that the majority of those who occupy these seats which are now empty have not risked their heritage or faced the creepy and ruthless bureaucratic jungle that our SMEs and our self employed on the other side of these walls and that in many cases instead of being applauded and admired by taking the place they deserve in our society they are criticized demonised or accused of tax evaders of being exploiters and even criminals I speak to you from the experience that I treasure with almost thirty years of working life as an autonomous who knows and has suffered in his own flesh and shared in others which apisonator and insurmountable wall has become the Administration and bureaucracy for those who intend to create and grow a business or professional project that generates economic activity wealth and employment and without dying in the attempt It would be ideal for those who draft these voluminous bills to regulate the activity of others to experience first person experience thus knowing the difficulties involved in initiating a vital project with own ideas and scarce resources Of course it will always be up to you to show the party 's card and put yourself on some board of directors of those companies to which by the way with a lot of hypocrisy and makeup today you want to subject new taxes by making the masses believe that with this collection they will solve the lives of the 13 million Spaniards who are at risk of poverty today And they can't be more wrong because all this is the result of their ignorance their populism and their nightly idea that companies are an inexhaustible source that they can express without any negative consequences for their workers in the first place and for society as a whole A couple of weeks ago I was told by a friend who is a farmer who has a small holding Inés if the entrepreneurs in this field in this case the primary sector of the countryside we throw out the towel and get tired of crashing against the Administration labor tax local or autonomous then who is going to generate the jobs Who 's gonna do the job And I answered him Do n't worry we will always have a ministry an observatory or a state agency to put us in But then I thought Oh no We 're from VOX we do n't have the license we have it hard This is the reality As much as a bill is being brought to this House to market and sell a political product the problem of discouragement despair and exhaustion in Spain is not being solved A few months ago we could bring to this House that populist claim of a tax on the great fortunes which directly attacked the heart and financial muscle of those companies that after years of effort and work had managed to reach levels of employment generation assets and turnover that could turn them into competitive within and outside our borders But the problem with dolomies is that as they yielded benefits they should remain in the hands of Yolanda or Mary Jesus who have never risked a euro so that from the Olympus they will administer and distribute to the people as gifts the efforts of others We agree that we must all contribute to the maintenance of public expenditure with our taxes of course we do but when the balance is not compensated and public expenditure becomes unbearable the system collapses Why in Spain do we have a complete atomized business fabric in which micro-enterprises abound Do you think this is random Or does it have to do with the legislator having intervened the economy for decades voraciously without leaving room for those companies to grow Why do n't many entrepreneurs make it up to them to grow up Out of disdain Or is it rather because administrative barriers are such that they become insurmountable walls They are little David against Goliath the businessman against the Administration who far from helping him encouraging him encouraging him persecuting him harassing him and eventually exhausting himself We are faced with a law with much philosophy and little solution which reformulates the law of market unity which is tempered by that invented concept that you bring here from co-governance We are continuously harmonizing laws with Europe and however we are raising walls within our own borders normative walls that tarnish the growth of businesses with seventeen autonomous administrations sweeping each for their own home When certain billing thresholds are reached bureaucratic burdens multiply and say some it is preferable not to hire one more employee so as not to have to assume those obligations and their added costs We are faced with another new missed opportunity as they have said before to address the small size of Spanish companies which have mortality and atomisation far above the European average And the smaller size of the Spanish companies and this low productivity what it does is to waste economic recovery and business growth Some business organisations have come to identify up to one hundred regulatory barriers to competitiveness between societies and job creation This law has not succeeded in eliminating or simplifying these regulatory burdens or providing incentives for small and medium sized enterprises The problem in Spain therefore is not how to create companies but how to consolidate them and above all how to make them grow without being persecuted punished and penalised Experience shows and so our entrepreneurs say that every time you grow up the system puts a slab on you to give up As far as lateness is concerned another major outstanding subject for which this law has incorporated measures of dubious effectiveness and which pose more difficulties for SMEs to be able to access European funds at a very sensitive time for them in public terms I am referring to lateness and do not treat it private companies are not the only ones who incur lateness And as my colleague Rubén Manso said you will believe that with this law you will turn Spain into Silicon Valley but nothing further from reality Therefore I encourage you to go out there leave the seat for a while and encourage yourselves to create and grow and you will have a good bath of reality Only then will they understand that the political industry has nothing to do with the productive industry and that today official Spain maintains an infinite distance from real Spain Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,12.220949,-29.901325,41,thank president

#PatriciaDeLasHerasFernández,Thank you very much Madam President The amendment to the Railway Sector Act that we are discussing today seeks to transpose a European directive that should have been completed by 2018 at the latest We have been behind four years they talk about competing competences between the State and the autonomous communities on rail transport an interaction that should according to the opinion give better response to safety but note that we could not have a clearer and closer example that demonstrates the disaster of the autonomy or decentralization of competences on railway infrastructures the train that goes into the very hell itself in the Bejis fire because it was precisely a delay in the transmission of alerts between administrations that caused that train to enter the very same flames resulting in half of the injured passengers So let me question that supposed better answer to security as a pretext for assigning competences Returning to the subject of transposition I am going to tell you about your already known to all poor legislative work and it is that the CNMC has already pointed out the inadequate transposition of the directive with the Railway Sector Act itself because the rule laid down a sanctioning regime clearly insufficient On 21 December by Royal Decree Law 23/2018 transposition of directives to incorporate precisely incorrectly transposed aspects of the directive we are dealing with the railway law was re-amended without changing the sanctioning regime Finally the CNMC informed the preliminary draft of the amendment of the Law on the Railway Sector in respect of fees where the sanctioning regime is not changed and the CNMC reiterated once again the inadequate transposition of the directive by failing to comply with the provisions of the European framework Now that amendment is in parliamentary procedure Ladies and gentlemen it is no longer the amount of legislation that you need to transpose a directive but the most expensive government and with more advisors in history has transposed them all inadequately and late But its catastrophic way of legislating does n't end here no there 's still more By amending the Railway Sector Act with the specific purpose of transposing a directive for a specific purpose liberalisation they amend other rules such as the provision of air traffic services or the State General Budgets Act for the year 2021 which have absolutely nothing to do with the purpose of the rule There is a very interesting point that is included in the opinion where it is said that for reasons of general interest investment in railways maintenance conservation improvement of existing infrastructure and construction of new ones will be improved in order to ensure accessibility and territorial connectivity For we are going to talk about this connectivity and territorial accessibility 8 July Renfe tries to silence the criticisms for the absence of AVE to Malaga by just one train more on Thursday and Friday 10 July a Madrid Santander train leaves passengers stranded for four hours in Palencia 18 July passengers from a Ferrol train to Madrid are caught in the middle of the flames in Zamora 22 July Renfe continues to unrecover the pre-pandemic frequencies 25 July chaos in Seville and Alicante for several hours delays in the AVE to Madrid 29 July the engineers reveal that the projects for the train are increasingly worse 29 July trains such as those for Malaga or Barcelona with huge queues for delays in their departures 31 July the same at María Zambrano station the bus station in Madrid in Malaga 31 July Renfe reprogramm its trains until September and notice of delays in Andalusia 8 August the bus station in Madrid the bus station in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid

delays and breakdowns in his opening week They laugh at the extremists 22 August the ridiculous international the German press mocks Sánchez and his train of shame in Extremadura 22 August an Alvia arrives eighty minutes late leaving Renfe without an intervener 23 August a breakdown in the Cordoba Sevilla section at the height of Ecija causes train delays for several days 29 August the train enters the flames of the Bejis fire Not to mention the deterioration of the service due to the lack of staff casualties for long working hours of up to fifteen hours drivers who deconvoke strike under promise that they will hire more and now Alicante loses the direct connection of the AVE with the station of Atocha That ladies and gentlemen in July and August alone these are the daily problems of the citizens who use the train in addition to the Spain which you have abandoned and which today continue to abandon And as an example see your concessional bus map where stops and frequencies are reduced And let us hope that liberalisation will really serve to improve prices for citizens and not for Renfe to raise prices as he has been doing and that the rest will be the same I would not like to end without mentioning an important point which is the revision of prices in contracts which is intended solely and exclusively for supplies of rolling stock and components necessary for their manufacture and maintenance but they forget the service contracts which will automatically be excluded But moreover it is limited to the rail public service when it should be a global indexing for all the contracts of the Administration in this case railways In short in this norm which could have been without a doubt a norm that will affect in a very positive way the Spanish railway sector and in general the Spanish railway network which has many needs such as the conclusion of the Mediterranean Atlantic Cantabrian Mediterranean corridors the interconnection of the ports the intermodality of some of our industrial polygons and also of the ports neither treat nor establish the pillars to go forward Ladies and gentlemen of the Government liberalisation is planned for the whole of Europe not only for foreign companies to come and operate in Spain but for Spanish companies like Renfe to get to work in Europe We still hope that the Minister will answer our questions in order to report on Renfe 's actions to the French authorities with a view to operating in France So ladies and gentlemen get to work for real Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,23.169046,-32.635017,41,thank much madam president amendment railway sector act discussing today seeks transpose european directive completed 2018 latest

#EmilioJesúsDelValleRodríguez,With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen it is very clear to us that an abuse is taking place today as the spokesman for the Citizens Parliamentary Group said earlier What the Socialist Group has done in dealing with this motion for a law is shameful it has stolen the debate in this Parliament they have used in a way we could say fraudulently the possibilities given by the Rules of Procedure of the House and now I will explain to you why The Socialist Parliamentary Group registered a bill to amend an article in the transparency law to oblige public administrations to publish statistics and other data in relation to public contracts they held with micro small and medium sized enterprises Well since it was a single article and it was a very decaffeinated thing it was decided that it would be passed on to the Commission with full legislative competence that is that it did not have to go back to this plenary for approval In considering the proposal for a law which is the only debate we have had we referred to what was the amendment of that article of the law on transparency and they already warned that it was not much use to publish statistics because what small and medium sized enterprises needed as we had urged and did not listen to us was a real plan that would avoid the late payment of public contracts by public administrations which is the most late we have in Spain public administrations and with a sanctioning regime in such a way that the administration would be punished for failing to comply with that plan that would avoid the late payment of public contracts Well we abstained and passed on to the Commission the deadline for amendments was opened and the Socialist Group is presenting us with an amendment for an idea to be made the proposal for a law was a leaf and a half of nine sheets of amendment of a tax figure the tax on fluorinated gases which is actually creating a new tax because the amendment is such a large one modifies essential elements such as the tax fact among other issues which is actually repealing the previous regulation of the previous tax and creating a completely new tax figure On the other hand the Government of the nation was processing a bill that was identical to the amendment submitted and instead of following the procedure because they did not like the result of the public information because they had the affected sectors confronted they decided to sneak through the back door by amendment in a single article bill proposal that will be seen in the Commission With full legislative competence the creation of a tax figure without economic memory without reporting any kind of social impact or other order without the result of the previous information to which the bill had already been submitted in its process that is shame It is an outrage they are stealing as I said at the beginning the debate in this Parliament The legislative presentation was immediately constituted The first thing the PSOE representative said was let 's vote It was voted and it is clear with the majority of Frankenstein that the amendment is approved incorporated into the rapporteur 's report and quickly and nightly we are called to the Commission for the amendments which had remained alive after a long plenary session after nine o'clock in the evening We were asked to be brief in the speeches of course it was already more than nine o'clock in the evening when we had requested that it be suspended and called for another day but there quickly in a flat fold the bill was passed and its passage into the Senate In the Senate the Socialists have had the bad luck that two amendments have been adopted and that is why it is coming today because today we must introduce these two amendments so that the law can be sanctioned and enacted In other words a tax figure is created without debate in this Parliament We have not been able to discuss the substance we have not been able to amend the substance of the tax figure in this Parliament and this leads us once again to reaffirm that VOX is right when he says that we are faced with an autonomous regime on whose front there is a genuine autocrat because in his eagerness to co-opt all the institutions he is already laughing at the separation of powers and this is another test Then the Presidency will say that we withdraw from the Journal of Sessions that it is an autarchy and that at the head of it there is a genuine autocrat I hope that the same measuring rod will be used when we are called fascists sexists racists xenophobics because it offends us It offends me because I do not consider myself a fascist a sexist a xenophobic or a homophobic And as I am offended and as it goes beyond what should be a rational criterion of freedom of expression in this House if it is decided to remove from the Journal of Sessions that the President is an autocrat that every time he qualifies us as fascists sexists racist homophobes etc. he also removes himself from the Journal of Sessions because the offence is the same And if not it will be credited that from this institution unfortunately one collaborates with the autarchy We already saw it in its day two years ago when this Parliament was closed a measure which was very criticized and annulled by the Constitutional Court

#EmilioJesúsDelValleRodríguez,With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen for once some people will find it strange to say this I agree with what Mr Bel has said Indeed I thought we were going to come here and listen to the spokesman for the PSOE to present a proposal for a law on the amendment of the Law on Transparency and Good Governance to collect the obligation to make statistics on the volume of public procurement that affects micro small and medium sized enterprises and we have found that Mr Del Valle not me the other that of the PSOE has given us a campaign rally on Castile and León So that 's why I said I 'd match up for once with Mr. Bel I focus on the subject on what is on the agenda We have already stated on several occasions that at that time one of the previous speakers has also seen it this way what concerns small and medium sized enterprises most about their relationship with public administrations and with the whole network of public bodies and enterprises is the lack of diligence in the payment of public procurement prices There is tremendous delay and not only that but in specific public works there are works that had small implementation times that affect small and medium sized enterprises and that in many cases have had to be abandoned As early as April the VOX Parliamentary Group proposed a non-legislative proposal that the Government would take steps to avoid such late payment by public administrations to small and medium sized enterprises and self employed and was rejected with the votes of the entire left of this House In June in the Committee on Industry Trade and Tourism when the proposal for a law on which this proposal is based was debated and approved we also tabled an amendment not only calling for a late payment plan to avoid this delay in the payment of public procurement prices affecting micro small and medium sized enterprises but also a sanctioning regime and its Socialist Party members members of that committee did not want to accept the amendment They preferred to accept a light decaffeinated amendment in which it was only mentioned that the Government was being urged to take steps to avoid that lateness but they did not at all want to pick up the punishing party which we believe is essential On the other hand just over a month ago in this same Chamber we were discussing a non-legislative proposal on the possibility of amending the Law on Public Sector Contracts as well as the Law on Desindexation of the Spanish Economy in the sense that the requirements that the current legislation requires for the modification of prices and public contracts which as was said here mainly affected small and medium sized enterprises because it is the small and medium sized enterprises that are suffering the most from the rise of materials the other day we heard that aluminum has risen by over 200 wood by 70 They 're crazy prices and it's those small and medium sized enterprises which you say you want to help the ones that are suffering them Well that non-law proposal was also rejected by your left wing lordships And now they talk here about wanting to help small and medium sized enterprises which want small and medium sized enterprises to be awarded public contracts and the only thing they bring is that they publish statistics on the volume of public procurement that affects them and they also do so by amending the Law on Transparency and Good Governance rather than the Law on Public Sector Contracts And I was wondering why and I have the clear answer they want to wash their image They are the most opaque government in the history of democracy in Spain They appointed a President of the Transparency and Good Government Council who was rejected by the transparency associations The press immediately pulled headlines saying that he was a person linked to the Spanish Socialist Workers Party and that he could not chair a council whose function is among other things the control of the Government He gave them the same they appointed him and the first thing he did was to go to Mrs Calvo 's office then Vice President of the Government and then to Mr Bolaños then Secretary General of the Presidency of the Government to receive political slogans for the next day to ceas the Deputy Director General of Complaints of the Transparency Council Mrs Zambrano because she had dared to ask the data of the use of the Falcon by the President of the Government and because she had given the Government a period of ten days to present the list of those unknown members of the advisory commission in the first part of the VOCID pandemic It was fulminated There were headlines throughout the press I liked Digital Journalist the most who said that the dirt on the Transparency Council does n't even go with Cillit Bang That 's magnificent But there have been all kinds of them It is rare that with the amount of subsidies you give to the media there has been unanimity in which there is dirt and little transparency As I have little time left although another spokesman has already said I would like to remind you of what the ABC said yesterday

#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,"Thank you so much Good morning ladies and gentlemen Good morning Madam First Vice President of the Government and Minister of Economy We came to discuss the validation of Royal Decree 1/2022 which by its title should simply reform some aspects of Sareb and FROB In fact it is the only thing the minister has told us about which has forgotten that not only Law 9/2012 Law 11/2015 and Royal Decree 1559 2012 are being amended but also the Royal Decree Law 32/2021 which we were validating this morning and Law 1/2004 are being amended It is to say apart from the reforms on the Sareb and the FROB a series of minor reforms are made in this usual technique to which we are accustomed by the Government the commercial hours of the areas of great tourist influx the Statute of the Workers and the regime of the workers in the service of the public sector are touched This legislative technique with the House and the citizenry generates a kind of tragala like that to which we attended before yesterday if you vote against the obligation to use masks you are voting against the updating of pensions by correction of the deviation So we might as well sing minister as in Mary Poppins that of With a little sugar that pill they give you the pill they give you it will go better if there is a little You who already know her can continue her But I am going to focus on the two main points which are the reform of the FROB and the Sareb apart from the doubts that generate us the definition that make of the participations of the FROB as outside the heritage of the public administrations This does not concern the left that the participations of the FROB are outside the heritage of the public administrations it is true that it is when it is done within a process of resolution but we are concerned we are especially concerned because the participation of the FROB in La Caixa through BCA has not been acquired in a process of resolution but by exchange What are we worried about We are concerned about the two major points I am going to deal with which are the taking of share ownership over 50 which as you know was banned to date and the transfer of real estate assets to non-profit making entities I 'm not going to insist on the figures The minister explained them to us very well What did he tell us Eurostat told us that this counted as deficit as debt debt was increased according to the excessive deficit protocol by 34 billion but it also told us something more The financial engineering operation designed by Mr De Guindos at the end of 2012 it is true that he had just taken the disaster that you the Socialist Party gentlemen left behind a disaster all he was trying to do was avoid the computability of Sareb 's public debt and what Eurostat has told him is that this is public debt And this could not be known Did n't you know Well look this took me by surprise You will forgive the immodestness that is self citing In December 2012 the newspaper El Economista gave me a column to talk about this issue in December 2012 and I said that an analysis beyond the formal aspects of the operation showed that it was public debt In the end it 's what it 's turned out to be Eurostat 's decision does not force the majority of share capital to be taken it does not force regardless of the commercial problems generated by a company with a capital deficit which many have long been solved in the regulation of the Sareb What the government has done from my point of view in this case with good judgment has been once it has lifted the veil of falsehood in which we have lived all this time Minister to make an offer to 54.1 of the capital at least less than 200 euros last week About the price we 're not gonna say anything The Sareb is broken and nothing 's good It has a capital deficit of 9200 million and it has to be assumed by the State but it does not have to be assumed by the State because we are talking about a private sector as you say but because it endorsed the bonds The bonds issued by the Sareb were what the Sareb handed over to the seven savings banks to a subsidiary bank of a savings bank plus a very small private bank as a counterpart to the assets that were handed over to it and endorsed it at the same time I mean we can't now get our hands on our heads Mrs. Calviño In this case it is not because of ignorance but because of lack of intellectual honesty You can't say you 're saving the private sector because this was public from the beginning If it was known that after the 48 billion of capital was consumed everything that was lost had to be put by the state because it was a guarantor a guarantor since December 2012 It has cost us with data on 30 June 2021 14,092 million of which 11,495 are absorbed by the public sector because it loses all its participation and loses 9200 million of the capital deficit while private shareholders lose 2597 Was this predictable I already told you This was nothing more than a silo a silo where assets bought from the beginning over their reasonable value on the one hand to prevent the rescued entities which were basically savings banks these seven come from mergers in turn from savings banks from recording more losses than they had already published and on the other hand to sustain the prices of the real estate sector with that long term sales policy It is not reasonable that having received 51 billion assets and sold only 20 000 in the first eight and a half years data as at 30 June 2021 14 billion losses have been reaped and that with the high market since the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014 which shows that this is not a problem of mismanagement but of operation forgive me the expression Minister misguided misguided I would n't have liked to have been given this responsibility This rather than a silo has been a sine qua non to hide the painful management of PP and PSOE with the help of United Left unions and business associations of savings banks entities with more social perspective than the exclusive digitalism that you are promoting And now they complain that there is part of the population that does not have access to basic financial services I will conclude Madam President We are also concerned I said at the beginning about the transfer of real estate to non-profit entities because it seems that you pretend that

#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I will not explain to you what the proposal is about today those who have already spoken to me have already explained it In any case Mr Rego you begin by saying that you are not going to talk about what you do not know but the only thing you have done is a genuine exercise of ignorance starting with the article you are presenting Today he has explained to us very well the difference between a credit section and a cooperative well he has not explained it well but he has distinguished the two figures However you in the article you propose say 4 This law will not apply to loan contracts g granted by the cooperative credit sections to their own cooperative partners and here comes the error 'as long as they are cooperatives set up for a social purpose other than the professional provision of financial services Look if they were engaged in the professional provision of financial services they'd be credit unions they could n't be credit sections okay But I have seen that today you have already begun to distinguish the one that you did not distinguish was Mrs Garrido in the exhibition that you made us As some of those who have spoken before me have told you Mr Martínez Oblanca for example this is not a rule that benefits big people as they have said it is a rule that benefits consumers You do n't think I 'm suspicious of your proposal And you know why not Because I am very much in favour of deregulation and because I believe that the financial sector is overly regulated But of course when they apply to you it turns out perhaps because in your constituency you have up to five credit sections in a province It 's a very high number You know that it is basically in the Mediterranean arc where there are many and in Catalonia where credit sections break and I tell you this because Mr López Bas has warned you that credit sections sometimes break That is why I cannot understand why you also require me to decafeate your controls Credit sections sometimes break down they 're very dangerous I tell you I do n't see it wrong for two reasons because we are great supporters of the social economy and because we also believe that things are very regulated excessively regulated Nor can it be said as has been said here that Spanish mortgage regulation is No Spanish mortgage regulation was and is one of the best in the world and has allowed a lot of mortgage credit at very low cost regardless of what happened in the crisis We 've forgotten that You keep talking about banking crisis maybe because you do n't distinguish a credit section from a cooperative The crisis was n't banking it was basically savings banks The entities that were saved were banks i.e. credit institutions in the form of an anonymous company and rural boxes working boxes professional boxes i.e. credit cooperatives And do you know why credit unions and banks were saved Because they own it because they own it As for savings banks as they did not own them politicians basically devoted themselves to assaulting them The credit sections do not cease to be what they have explained a small closed universe where some co-operatives deposit money and others take it on credit Undoubtedly if you want to lower demands you are adding risks to borrowers I too understand this because of the excessive bureaucracy of the demands that are being brought into Spain They do not cease to be a way of eliminating financial intermediation as you have explained and of favouring the saver and the borrower but you are forgetting that precisely because of your form those credit portfolios in the credit sections lack total diversification They are granted in a very specific geographical area to people who sometimes engage in the same activity sometimes if the cooperative is from a sector and you are considering people who have the same profession and are from the same geographical area so that the portfolio is very little diversified and the risk is high It is true that they enjoy that health that the commercial relations of the next that is true to see who stops paying a credit when the depositor is his neighbor In that sense I see the positive side The credit sections do not cease to be one of the best expressions of microfinance of what were the piles of piety as well which were loaded when the savings boxes were loaded In the background cooperativism reminds much of Schumacher 's work I remind you that he is an economist not a Formula 1 pilot which was entitled The little one is beautiful Schumacher is a very dear author for you on the left until you read it They often want it very much for their manifest ecologicalism and their defense of local production for local needs as the most efficient for economic life I say this because you Mr Rego in this sense have defended cooperatives but Schumacher always defended the use of coal against oil and already announced the creation of an international cartel which ended up being OPEC since production was in the hands of unsteady and bellicose countries I mean Schumacher fifty years ago was already a great advocate of energy sovereignty In any case let us conclude what you have brought here today is just an example of the excessive regulation that threatens us Of course as you refer to the five credit sections in your province you bring this problem to the House The excessive regulation is very clearly seen in two very specific sectors I say this because last week interventionism was defended Do you know what they are In the banking or credit institutions sector and in the electricity sector and with these two sectors consumers are not exactly happy What I really think is that precisely in these sectors which are so much involved which are so distasteful to consumers nothing would be understood if it were not because they are a magnificent place of employment for former politicians it should not be a coincidence Thank you very

#JuanJoséAizcorbeTorra,"Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen as we said in the previous debate this rule is a failure of the legislator and not even the triumph of the partyocracy It is the flagrant abuse of a Government and specifically of the Ministry of Finance which orders the parties that support it to serve their interests to plunder if it is more up to the middle self governing and entrepreneurial classes in a wasteful State that prevents any new opportunity for those who acting properly and in good faith have failed in their professional or entrepreneurial endeavour especially the self governing We also said that all this has prevented a paused conscientious and responsible analysis and debate of key competition legislation on competitiveness in our economy The processing of this rule with 607 amendments in Congress and 252 in the Senate has been carried out at a record time whose work in the Paper was limited to one day and a few weeks later is already debated by the Senate with four amendments that we are dealing with today With regard to the amendments which have already been voted on before speaking Mr Bal with which the conviction is relative one of them is contradictory according to the very reasoned message accompanying the opinion the one referred to in Article 37c of the Law in relation to the competitions and more specifically the appointment of the competition manager who becomes a competitive mediator which is not the meaning of the law but which in the opinion itself invokes the possible contradiction another remains half hearted but has its meaning to slightly limit the harmful and abusive privileges of public credit in Article 690 of the Law a third only formal one affecting Article 704 of the Consolidated Text and the fourth logical third transitional in drawing up the regulation in the competitions administration Having said that we are faced with one of the rules that has undergone the most changes throughout history and with the text that will come out of this House today it will continue to change because it is engaged in its early interpretation under article 1.6 of the Civil Code taking into account the complementary nature of the case law and which we fear will soon be It is a rule that was amended by Royal Decree 1/2020 of 5 May which approved the consolidated text a consolidated text that was not such and denied the exemption from public credit and since it was a legislative decree there was a legal gap due to the over limitation in its harmonization which forced the application of the ultra vires principle a legal principle that considers null and void acts that exceed the limit of the law and that legislative decree did so As a rule in this Government I ignored as such a rule the doctrine of the Supreme Court and in particular the treatment of the exemption from public credit in the procedure of the second opportunity on which I will focus I 'll try to explain it as for laymen in the matter but I 'm sure they 'll understand me When a company goes badly a trading company goes to the competition procedure it is dealt with agreements or agreements are attempted and if this is not possible it is settled and with the liquidation the company dies it is terminated and settled in the Commercial Register and if no liability has been derived to the administrators since their action has been diligent the burial of the legal person with all the debts including the public credit is formalized by the closure of the corresponding sheet sheet volume and book in the commercial register and ceases to exist without more than the legal person Well to individual entrepreneurs self employed and natural persons who under the same conditions are subject to commercial and competitive legislation the liquidation obviously does not end the actual death of the natural person good but at the same time we will see in fact it is civil death with outstanding debts that persist and they are forced to act outside the system through testaferros and in the submerged economy The only possibility is to give such persons a second chance and thus exemption by agreement or by liquidation if the requirements of any credit including public credit are met Not here not in Spain Minister in clear contradiction to what is suggested and proposed by Directive 2017 1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council Let the Spaniards know all those who can affect what we are discussing today that with the new text that is adopted less public credit can be exonerated than with the rule that currently governs the treatment of the known second chance procedure Courts and hearings specifically I would like to highlight that of Barcelona following the consolidated text and applying the ultra vires principle continued to exempt under the Supreme Court 's criterion 50 of public credit and the other 50 went to a payment plan which if it did not come to pass but it was shown that the debtor had used the humanely possible resources it ended up exonerating If someone had a debt for example EUR 80 000 40,000 will be exonerated directly and the rest by agreement with the said exception For now it is only possible to exempt a maximum of EUR 10,000 so it will continue to owe EUR 70,000 that cannot be paid as the debtor will immediately switch to the submerged economy or act by way of testaferros This is what there is nothing more or less is legal practice and those of us who have dedicated ourselves to this we know Moreover by mor of the first transitory in those procedures already initiated and informed to our customers the clients in general of all the legal advisers of that practice from now on the rules of play are changed they will not be able to exonerate and they are also being prevented from starting again on that second opportunity and this is an attack minister on the principle of irretroactivity of the laws In short we understand that this Government is only thinking of collecting if not it would not be so afraid of exonerating public credit and of plundering not protecting and supporting entrepreneurs and self employed people on a second chance those who did all right who tried everything and went wrong It 's been a missed opportunity This law unfortunately is not written on lasting stone It is an ephemeral

#JuanJoséAizcorbeTorra,"Mr. President thank you very much Ladies and gentlemen a missed opportunity I would like to thank the other rapporteurs less Mr Aranda for the treatment we have had in the discussion at a single presentation meeting of a 2019 directive amending another 2017 directive namely 1132 Thus on the 23rd day in the Committee on Justice a law was passed in two days containing six hundred and seven amendments and involving more than two hundred legislative reforms An absolute failure as legislators They have prevented a debate as has been said from paused a calm and conscientious debate on a law that affects us all that affects the citizen that affects SMEs and that affects the self employed that ultimately affects the economy of this country in a tangential way It has four large blocks which I believe are important restructuring plans the second chance the special procedure and the competition administration basically As far as restructuring plans are concerned the figure of the restructuring expert is introduced which will see what the rating is at the end and whether or not it works As for the second chance I 'm coming in now As regards the special procedure which was not the subject of European transposition the scope of application is reduced in relation to the liabilities of the undertakings concerned the percentage of public credit is increased to bring the debtor into liquidation and the application for attorney and attorney is imposed And as far as the competition administration is concerned certainly and here we have some representatives this figure is clearly demonized in this law something has been harmonized or reassured but not sufficiently As for the second chance yesterday the providence made him receive this car in the office This is a car of benefit of exemption from the dissatisfied liability a car in which a customer is exempt and I have to say because I promised for an amount of EUR 1 064 000 Do you know when the procedure that led to this EUR 1 064 000 benefit exempt order began which is no longer a benefit and will now be called a benefit exempt order I started it in October 2015 when we had the royal decree that the People 's Party made that way a week before the debate on the state of the nation that Royal Decree 1/2015 which later became Law 25/2015 second chance There it was not possible to legislate well because it was not granted article 1911 of the Civil Code was feared Fortunately in several judgements not only from Catalonia but also from Mallorca and other jurisdictions in Supreme Court judgements of 13 March 2019 and 2 July 2019 the exemption of public claims was achieved With this we find here a very strange situation which links with the amendment and they do not withdraw it 266 of Squerra Republicana in which the transitional first talks about continuing the procedure of consecutive competitions through the old legislation What 's the meaning of this The meaning is that with the new law you will be able to exonerate less public credit than with the previous one because on the basis of the principle ultra vires which Mr Bal and the lawyers who are here know very well you cannot accept the reform that extralimits the law ultra vires as did the consolidated text that banned the exemption from public credit The Supreme Court in the words of Sancho Gargallo himself made it very clear the exemption from public credit is still applicable For the time being a calculation has been made on very specific quantities With all the calculations that I have through the derivation of the liability of the natural person who already know how the Tax Agency shoots simply by the relation of the Competition Law in article 5 of article 367 I can assure you that cases of derivation of the liability of the natural person for 150,000 euros or 100,000 euros are being kicked and the Tax Agency is willing to continue to exist This exemption from public credit does not serve us it does not serve the second chance at all and it is crushing the self employed And above all we ask that the transitory first be maintained not because they are Catalans or because

#JuanJoséAizcorbeTorra,"Madam President ladies and gentlemen good morning Indeed Minister these are times of darkness and uncertainty of fears and pre-powers but under no circumstances should they be times of silence or complacency We are faced with a real decree law in principle which is innocuous I would say patch where the general practice of the rule is aimed at regulating labour and social security matters to which we do not object measures for self employed persons measures relating to ERTs and extensions until 31 March the extension of the MECUIDA Plan until 30 June aid to part of the culture sector and to Taurino professionals is extended until 30 June 2022 measures are envisaged but very short with regard to the enterprises and workers of the Canary Islands affected by the volcanic eruption registered in the area of the Old Summit measures for the care of minors are also regulated and finally different issues of the General Law on Social Security are amended In short it comes to alleviate deficiencies and defects of previous regulation created by you and denounced by us But as usual this government which retorts into illegality in a submissive manner comes to the barrage of rules and adds innocently sweetly sweetly sweetly the legitimacy of those who occupy private property without any title enabling it as the rule specifically dictates I insist without any title enabling it proposing to extend until 30 September 2022 the illegal occupation of housing In addition it is a horrendous legislative technique Minister horrendous and biased Notice on 24 February this royal decree was born and this illegal octopus was extended until 30 September 2023 However on 2 March Law 4/2022 leaves it again on 28 February but later in Royal Decree Law 3/2022 of 2 March it returns to 30 September a genuine legislative gallimatías We must pull up again for the government 's incompetence is unheard of We have already said this in the debate on labour reform this government has abandoned the majority of workers making it difficult to create jobs obviating SMEs and the self employed as the main drivers of the occupation in Spain In the meantime the Government its Government Mr Minister has announced that it will allocate 21.3 billion to cross-cutting feminist policies all of which are mandated by the 2030 Agenda They just do n't have the least decorum We are faced with a historical record of the bill of light which we have been reporting for months and with gasoline at almost 2 euros litre and the Government announces that it will allocate 21.3 billion to cross-cutting feminist policies There are 300,000 more long term unemployed today than before the pandemic more than in seventeen European Union countries together and the Government announces that it will allocate 21.3 billion to cross-cutting feminist policies There are 3 112 000 unemployed 13 the highest unemployment rate in the eurozone the OECD and the European Union and the government announces that it will allocate 21 300 million to cross-cutting feminist policies The planned seizure of the self employed is being prepared as has been said here with new contributions with benefits being lost and the Government announces that it will allocate 21,300 million to cross-cutting feminist policies In SEPE offices they are barely able to respond and the Government announces that 21.3 billion will be allocated to cross-cutting feminist policies We continue with fiscal plunder we continue with looting and we continue with inflation and the Government announces that it will allocate € 213 billion to cross-cutting feminist policies It was the Union Solidarity alone that protested against the robbery of light and the rise of prices as early as September 2021 in the face of criticism from all of you and when still Minister the brave patriots of Ukraine were not assaulted and died with honor in the face of the attacks of satrap Putin Their use of war like that of the President of the Government is spurious and miserable Those who used to seek out class unions now will not find them because they are subsidized and are the voice of their master Whoever looks for the lesser evil in VOX is wrong for we are going to find the good possible Anyone who wants to replace sensible agreements for the benefit of Spain and the Spanish by consensus green cursis between left pejos and progress of right that lead us to suicide as a community that forgets us He said at the beginning that they are times of darkness and uncertainty of fears and prepotences but under no circumstances should they be times of silence or complacency Whoever wants a strong but small austere effective and agile state has 21.3 billion reasons to go out on the street on March 19

#PedroJesúsRequejoNovoa,They are presenting to this House demands on the security of the outer areas of the nuclear power plants in Tarragona They request the transposition of Directive 2014 87 Euratom but it was already transposed in 2018 exactly by Royal Decree 1402/2018 of 23 November I was n't going to say it but since you asked for it and I know the facts I 'm telling you And it only affects external security in the appropriate coordination with internal security What remains to be transposed is Directive 2013 59 Euratom and the Nuclear Security Council and the Ministry of the Interior are working to transpose it As for the modification of the planning areas they request these are one of the basic concepts associated with the radiological criteria in the plans being the Nuclear Security Council the only agency competent for definition and development based on its creation law without prejudice to the necessary coordination with the Ministry of the Interior in those aspects of civil protection logistics communications etc We have long and long spoken in the nuclear paper about the necessary independence of the regulator with the unanimous practice of parliamentarians He comes to talk about nuclear safety for people We all value it it 's very important it sounds very good and they think we have to support it VOX of course is in favour of as much safety as possible in all matters relating to power stations and therefore we believe that the exclusive competence of the Nuclear Security Council is very good Nuclear risk management is the exclusive competence of the State at all its stages in the face of a type of risk with an undoubted national nature it may even be international and in which it is preferable for response mechanisms to have a single command For once and without precedent we agree with the Minister of the Interior In addition you ask for it with that lament of secular abandonment that reminds us so much of Spain steals us that you no longer believe yourselves He told us about roads without asphalting the last time forgetting that they are the government in Catalonia and that they have been able to impose on the Spanish government the pardon of the coupts of 27 October 2017 the elimination of the crime of sedition of the Criminal Code and the reduction of the sentence of embezzlement VOX will work tirelessly to stop Sanchez 's blow In the field of energy Catalonia presents a great distinction with respect to the rest of Spain The vast majority of all electricity generated in Catalonia is of nuclear origin 58 more than half They 'd already like a percentage of that indepes In all of Spain only 21 are of nuclear origin Does it sound like you 've heard VOX talk about energy sovereignty They influence the government but this time for good and make it extend the life of the power plants or they will leave them in the dark They require a couple of small modular reactor projects for Catalonia to put them at the spearhead of modernity Do you want more nuclear safety Straighten up the seventh waste plan and have it build the ATC The difference in security between the ATIs we have now which are provisional and a centralized storage is multiplying security by four If they continue to support the Government as they have so far they will end up with closed and demolished power stations and lonely expanses full of rusty cans in the open waiting for politicians to agree to build deep geological storage Then it will be too late for Spain and therefore for Catalonia We 'll have lost another train of real progress On the improvement of infrastructures and the improvement of the mobile telephone network nothing to object to but we also ask for the rest of Spain Thank you very

#AndrésAlbertoRodríguezAlmeida,Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen first of all I should like to refer to the amendments which have been maintained and which will be voted on in advance of the opinion With regard to Amendment No 30 by Mr Bel Accensi and Mrs Cañadell Salvia for the deletion of Article 13.2 k it seems reasonable to us that the current wording represents a genuine sanctioning disproportionateness and is inconsistent with the limitation of business risk Amendment 41 of the People 's Parliamentary Group assumes the postulates of VOX against the regulatory differences generated by the autonomous communities We congratulate you ladies and gentlemen on the fight against the autonomous state which only generates inequality and division among the Spanish The Republican Group with its amendments 42 and 44 aligned with Mrs Illamola Dausà 's amendment 8 and 43 reiterates the non-law proposal on the increase of gambling tax and the limitation of its advertising discussed already in this plenary session on 30 November 2021 The initiative repeated today was only intended to deepen the disruptive factor of the autonomous state so we will vote against it All this as far as the bottom is concerned With regard to the forms I am obliged to stress the complete absence of the debate proper to the handling of any legislative initiative the absence of debate imposed by the groups supporting in this House the coalition of the Social Communist Government of President Sánchez These parliamentary groups once again converted the first meeting of the Paper into the only session of the Paper The institutional abuse that represents the absence of parliamentary debate has been accomplished with forms lacking not only in the minimum parliamentary courtesy and elementary education but also in the fulfilment of the obligations of parliamentary procedure by failing to make known beforehand the texts which were intended to be included in the report of the House by stealing the reading and the debate of the same as provided for in Rule 72.2 of the Rules of Procedure of this House Another example of an anomalous and anti-democratic development has been the inclusion of the five amendments of the Socialist Parliamentary Group and the Confederal Group of the United Nations We can say that as the lawyer has stated in the paper 's report they do not seem to meet the requirements of homogeneity and congruence with the draft law in accordance with the doctrine of the Constitutional Court The Bureau should have ignored them by rating them What is the relationship between the prosecution of tax fraud and the manipulation of sports betting which is the subject of this bill and the reform of the sanctioning regime of the General Law for the Defense of Consumers and Users Well absolutely no relationship The abdication of the Bureau 's obligation to monitor amendments before they are adopted significantly affects the handling of the legislative initiatives of this House How far will the degradation of the highest institutions of the State by the parties that support this social communist government go As for the claimed majority which is a recurring appeal by the parliamentary groups that support the Frankenstein Government to justify these democratic abuses I must remind you that the majority that have formed in this Congress of Deputies has been the result of the lie and betrayal not only of President Sánchez but of each and every member of the Socialist Parliamentary Group because during the election campaign they repeatedly promised their voters that they would not agree with Unite Podemos or Bildu Therefore ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Parliamentary Group your majority lacks all legitimacy as it is the result of the deception of the Spanish people the sole holder of national sovereignty of which you by your deception and betrayal have become unworthy and illegitimate representatives I appeal to all those socialist parliamentarians to show a minimum of dignity and commitment to the PSOE voters They owe a minimum of fidelity to their electoral promises and therefore have to oppose the manoeuvres of the autocrat President Sánchez for the destruction of the rule of law and the separation of powers Each of you is held responsible for everything that happens as you continue to give your votes to the betrayal of the Socialist Party voters leaving them in the hands of the most radical and sectarian left represented by the Communist Party the ideology responsible for hundreds of millions of crimes in the past 20th century They have also been abandoned in the hands of those who jail honor and represent the ruthless assassins of ETA and finally in the hands of those who with another attempt at a coup d'état against the territorial integrity of Spain are constantly threatening us Your votes ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Parliamentary Group in the service of the autocrat President Sánchez serve only to keep President Sánchez travelling in Falcon while the Spaniards cannot afford to pay for their cars petrol and are increasingly struggling to access basic food and goods Stop the maneuvers of destruction of the democratic rule of law such as the assault on the Constitutional Court the last guarantee to the repeated abuse of the fundamental freedoms and rights of the Spaniards that President Sánchez claims with the help of the People 's Party Ladies and gentlemen I 'm not asking you for anything you have n't done before I will read you the October 1 2016 column of the PSOE newspaper After a dramatic day with screams cries and insults it came to eight and twenty o'clock in the evening when Sanchez agreed that the members of the federal committee would vote hand in hand on his proposal to hold a primaries to elect the secretary general He was defeated by 132 votes against and 107 in favour a minute later he announced his resignation Ladies and gentlemen you have the opportunity to obtain the just solution of these Courts and the convening of elections that would allow the Spaniards to exercise their legitimate right to elect representatives worthy of their trust From VOX we will continue to put all legal political and social means in place to put an end to this government 's lies ruin and misery Thank you very

#RivoltaErica,"Mr President first of all I would like to thank all the members of the Government who followed the measure in particular the undersecretary Mr Sartore who has always been present making the trip with the MEF and the rapporteurs As has already been said by others it seems a bit anachronistic to work on a decree law passed in fact by events But in these two years there has been an acceleration of events that have upset the normal life pattern of households businesses the state and municipalities We must therefore go quickly and try to act with timely and timely measures to prevent the system from jumping We have seen that inflation has begun to grow after years of constant levels the risk is that inflation is also added to stagnation which is the worst of economic conditions But we come to what is contained in the decree law support ter and above all to the amendments that have improved the measure First of all there has been a follow up to what has already been done in the budget law for the recruitment of personnel where it was planned in the police forces and in other categories with an amendment that provides for the sliding of the rankings of the students police officers In many parts there is a demand to increase the number and presence of the police forces for the safety of the cities for the emergency Covid for the entry of Ukrainian refugees and for a thousand other things obviously these people must also be hired The adoption of a number of amendments concerning the tourism sector is also good We remember that tourism represents our oil because it is really our wealth Therefore the non-refundable appropriations for tourist buses and tour guides as well as the exemption from social security contributions for tour operators and travel agencies are good This is one of the topics on which the League has always insisted because in the absence of intervention this would have caused the default of many artisans and traders they speak of 600,000 people So it 's an absolutely positive thing There has also been an extension of the deadlines for approving the 2021 consolidated financial statements and financial statements for the reporting of the Regional Health Service aid to the Regions There was then during the discussion an episode concerning the administration contracts Although there were two amendments by Forza Italia and the League on this very subject which had received the favourable opinion both from the competent Ministry of Labour and from the MEF there was a proposal for an extension of only three months when the amendments provided for the abolition of the deadline of 30 September This proposal was voted on by the whole Commission with the exception of the League Group which voted against We believe that at this time of major labour crisis we must defend work and not facilitate redundancies I remember that 110,000 jobs are at risk and recently 450 temporary jobs were fired by Poste Italiane This is what has unfortunately happened and is incomprehensible but I would like to remind you briefly of what has not been done Mr President there was an amendment by Mr Arrigoni on the qualification of companies a non-payable and very important amendment that asked us all the categories of the construction sector because it would have allowed us to exclude all those companies that were born as mushrooms without staff that grey area in which the scam aspect could also reside This amendment like other proposals has not been completed and it has been a huge mistake because everyone was waiting for it and because it would reward serious entrepreneurs who with difficulty continue to stand and give work for real There were also other amendments such as that of Mr Briziarielli which included measures for the bodies responsible for environmental surveillance and control or that of Senator Cantù on the free professional activity of health workers It is not possible that with the work so important that it has been done despite all the time limits dictated by the haste or by the situation as I said before anachronistic it is not possible to complete the process of some absolutely good and positive proposals because they do not physically arrive at the last second the amendments We will have to take an in depth look at this It 's not

#ArrigoniPaolo,"Mr President Under Secretary of State ladies and gentlemen I am speaking on articles relating to the concessions for the distribution of natural gas and those of major hydroelectric origin On the first dealt with in Article 4 of the basic text which has now become Article 6 after the move to the Commission the League expresses partial satisfaction The inclusion of this topic in the draft competition law had and has the objective to overcome the stalemate in the races for the reassignment of the concessions that lasts for more than ten years during which by the 177 minimum territorial areas very few competitive procedures have been carried out also because of many expensive and very long disputes This is a stalemate which is effectively precluded from the country 20 billion investments in the sector which are estimated over 12 years of the duration of the concessions The basic text which aimed to relaunch investments in the sector by accelerating the tendering procedures and which already positively in case the Municipality intends to sell networks and plants allowed to properly exploit the gas distribution networks owned according to the residual industrial value also thanks to the contributions of the League has been little improved However more had to be done for example as we have proposed to encourage and support the aggregations between companies in order to give greater competitive impetus in the competitions thus reducing the current fragmentation that now records more than 200 operators of which more than half that together cover only 20 of the market or it should have allowed the Municipality to alienate its own networks and distribution facilities even before the contract of reliance of the distribution service This is to better capitalise on its assets which on the other hand run the risk of not being properly valued during the competition Moreover it should have been foreseen that the contracting authority should appoint the tendering commissioners by extracting them from a list of experts of proven experience defined by the Ministry of the ecological transition I hope that I am wrong but I fear that by approving this text we have not effectively amended the rules and therefore we have not created the conditions to promote the development of competition and to remove the many regulatory and administrative obstacles that do not favour the conduct of competitions On the concessions of large hydroelectric derivations now dealt with in article 7 the League expresses great satisfaction instead With the approval of the amendment in the Commission after the majority agreement the basic text which presented several critical issues that would worsen the current national legislation has been positively amended In practice both the regionalisation of the sector and the procedures for renewing expired concessions are confirmed These therefore will be carried out by the Regions in compliance with the criteria and guidelines already established by the national norm strongly desired by the League and introduced in the phase of conversion of Decree Law 14 December 2018 n. 135 which I remember last year allowed to archive the European infringement procedure opened against Italy We are very happy because in these two years the norm has resisted last also during the negotiation on the plan of competition law several attempts of some political forces that have tried to dismantle the regionalization of the field and therefore demolish one of the first concrete forms of autonomy of the Regions or to propose the extension of the concessions for these the reasons avoiding the arrival of foreign operators forgetting that already now the majority of the operators of the hydroelectric are participated from foreign investors and guarantee the safety of the energy system and the national autonomy energy These are two aspects that are certainly important ignored for many years and discovered only in the last few weeks but that we are convinced will be pursued precisely with the renewals of the concessions Recentralising the management and extending the concessions in fact would have represented a tight entry against the regions that have already legislated or are providing it it would have represented a huge gift to the outgoing dealers who would have continued to make so many profits confirming yet another wrong to the mountainous territories exploited without any return with erial damages to be borne by Regions Provinces Municipalities and mountain communities of more than 10 billion euros it would have violated the conditions laid down by the European Commission which withdrew the infringement procedure provided that it proceeded with the procedures of reassignment of the concessions it would have determined a third rejection of the extension by the Constitutional Court after the 2008 judgment on the ten year extension previewed by the law 23 December 2005 n. 266 and the second judgment of 2011 on the extension of five years previewed by Decree Law 31 May 2010 n. 78 This is the victory of common sense With the completion of the competitive procedures of reassignment of the expired concessions wet goods i.e. the properties of dams gripping works canals tunnels and forced conducts will be relegated to the regions and appropriate compensation will be paid to the affected mountain territories through appropriate water charges free electricity environmental and territorial compensation Finally after more than twenty years of stalemate a season of great investments will start to modernise and relaunch the hydroelectric a strategic programmable renewable energy asset for our country The investments will allow to realize actions of improvement of power generation and efficiency of the plants in order to produce more renewable electricity and therefore to contribute to reach the target increasingly challenging of energy from renewable sources and also to pursue the reduction of our energy dependence The investments will allow to realize actions of technological and structural improvement necessary in order to improve the efficiency of the goods on dams and conducted in order to assure the better conservation of the volumes of invaded to upgrade the systems of pumping and therefore to increase the ability to accumulation in order to greater safety of the energy system The investments will enable the improvement and environmental improvement of the catchment area concerned by the installation under concession as well as the coordinated management of water resources in order to exercise control over various aspects such as the management of lake levels and the need for irrigation The investments will allow to give an opportunity to the Italian supply chain known in the world made of excellence both with regard to machinery and technology and with regard to companies This is not only one of the first forms of regional autonomy but I stress this again the renewal of hydroelectric concessions with investments in new or existing plants is a driver necessary to aim for zero CO2 emissions in 2050 The International Energy Agency is also said to be in its latest report entirely dedicated to this renewable source According to the director of the Agency Fatih Birol hydropower is the forgotten giant of the energy transition because investments have concentrated and badly are on wind and photovoltaic On the other hand the hydroelectric basins offer several advantages in addition to producing renewable electricity thanks to pumping they act as storage systems they can provide flexibility services to the electricity grid and thus help to compensate for the unprogrammable fluctuations I repeat of wind and photovoltaic parks In the world hydropower with a committed power of 1,330 gigawatts and a production of electricity of almost 4,500 terawattora per year is the largest source of clean energy and produces more than all other renewable sources put together wind solar photovoltaic bioenergy and geothermal In Italy the hydroelectric park consisting of more than 4,500 plants for a power of about 23 gigawatts of which 4 gigawatts of pumping and that in 2021 has supplied a production of 45 terawattora almost 16 percent of national electricity equivalent to 40 percent of all RES thanks to this norm is going to relive a new great season I would like to end by thanking Mr Garofoli Mr Pichetto Fratin Mr Bini Mr Girotto and above

#deBertoldiAndrea,"DE BERTOLDI FdI There 's no doubt about it We are talking about a further reform so they want to call it of the so called Government of the Best which unfortunately and unfortunately I stress is once again yet another downward reform I believe that no one in the so called majority and even less among the opposition parliamentarians is satisfied with the reforms we have had so far and I am thinking of the so called reform of competition the tax reform that is not even moving this reform of the procurement code and public contracts because they are not reforms They are small compromises someone slightly improved someone else absolutely useless someone else even harmful that bring nothing to our country I am talking about these things with professional colleagues with businesses with those who find themselves every day confronted with issues such as the greatest downside or the most economically advantageous offer I would like to point out for example that although the transition from the maximum decrease to the most economically advantageous offer dates back to 2016 and therefore to a few years ago the fact that it has been well presented in recent days Inarcassa i.e. from the National Insurance and Assistance Fund for Architects and Engineers is that still today most of the race commissions penalize the concept of the most economically advantageous offer and in fact it is still possible to award on the basis of a 40 50 percent reduction In terms of score the weight of the component relative to the most economically advantageous offer is well below the specific weight of the decrease This was an opportunity to express a clear word to give clear feedback on these passages and instead also on this little or nothing When we talk about downside I also think about numbers To quote a few numbers I would like to remind you that the projects completed late those projects that cost us so much from all points of view when referring to the reality awarded with the low down are 34 percent when instead you have with the maximum down we reach 66 and therefore double The number of disputes and we know what this means even in terms of costs for our communities where there is the highest drop it goes from 13 to 88 so it grows four or five times What do I mean by that We had above all you had as a majority the opportunity to have a heavy impact through this text on elements of this kind You had the opportunity to radically modify unequivocally and instead continue on a tracked road which did not bring great results despite the reform of 2016 Perhaps it is necessary that politics cooperating confronting helping abandoning the culture of suspicion which has led to always seeing negativity risks enemies even criminals in their counterparts and therefore has weighed down the bureaucracy as well as the work of the mayors and administrators making it almost impossible to make decisions without the fear of being incriminated We have created the conditions for work not to be done and procurement is a difficult sometimes unworkable and extremely risky passage for those who have to oversee them We would have liked more attention to be paid to these issues by the Government and the majority I would like to make a brief comment on another passage that I think is important also underlined in the recent conference in Inarcassa which I recall being the National Welfare and Assistance Fund for Engineers and Architects i.e. those who are an active part of such paths I am referring to fair compensation in contracts and tenders that issue which even in Parliament remains suspended because we do not want to complete it Even in public works contracts it should become a precise and precise reference because fair compensation means quality performance It 's not like that As we do not want to approve after years the law on fair compensation which could be done in just a few weeks in this area of Parliament we did not want to make it very clear that fair compensation must be a right for professionals who benefit not only those who work but also those citizens who demand valuable works works and projects made by trained technicians and therefore well paid in a fair and fair way There is another subject which I would like to mention and which has not been implemented I appeal to all of you who have practiced craft manufacturing and service companies operating in the world of procurement how many companies perhaps public sector creditors are excluded from invitations to tender for tax or social security irregularities We are talking about companies that would have all the requirements to be able to participate in public tenders and are instead excluded not because of their fault but because they may have paid late 5,000 or 10,000 euros of VAT and therefore have an irregularity even if not because of their fault I repeat but because they are some of the thousands of creditor companies towards the State the Regions and the Municipalities that is the public administration Therefore the public administration that excludes them from the invitations to tender is the very cause of the irregularity in which they have incurred In conclusion Madam President this is the reason why we of Brothers of Italy and I refer to the initial part of my speech would like to be more cooperative we would like to be heard and to be able to compare ourselves on the basis of the respect and trust of the entire country of our community We would like the problems of our country and our economy to be solved together On the other hand unfortunately sometimes one prefers to make insulting and useless polemics rather than to go to confront on the merit that as I said is always important

#FaggiAntonella,BEACHES L SP PSd Az Mr President I too of course thank the rapporteurs Senator Pergreffi and Senator Cioffi all 8a The Commission has committed itself to this rather particular measure and I shall now explain why The code of contracts is a story to write and it's an endless story The contract code what we are talking about and about almost daily can be referred to the legislative decree of 18 April 2016 no 50 The code was necessary because it was an instrument which had to transpose European directives no 23 24 and 25 of 2014 And the ultimate objective was to ensure fundamental values such as flexibility transparency the prevention of corruption the infiltration of organised crime introducing compared to the European directives additional instruments and even new institutions marked by greater rigour without falling into gold plating the practice of introducing levels of regulation higher than the minimum required by the directives This code therefore was to replace a decree of the President of the Republic of 2010 which used a set of guidelines called soft law This change of approach was intended to ensure greater simplicity and slimness It was the goal that had to be achieved In fact however this objective was never achieved because over time instead of adapting to European directives Parliament succeeded by a law of 28 January 2016 No 11 which delegated to the Government for the implementation of directives no 23 24 and 25 of 2014 to put in place the delegation law and two months later bore legislative decree no. 50 of 18 April 2016 Today we are in the exact same situation In 2016 first of all the decree a priori that bearing the decree of the President of the Republic n. 207 of 2010 was replaced with that of 2016 which had to transpose these directives Since 2014 these directives have not yet been transposed although there has been a legislative activity aimed at simplifying and realignment these procedures that have never happened We are in 2022 and we are again here with a delegation law that must transpose the famous directives of 2014 I say this for the sake of clarity because someone may have a vision of the code as a regulatory summary aimed exclusively at lightening simplifying and clarifying the rules governing public contracts and contracts In fact we and I say in general could have implemented and re-aligned all the legislation related to the topic referring to the European legislation compared to which other countries are much ahead of us since 2014 proposing perhaps an instrument that in addition to transposing could take a step further and arrive at the condition to review what is the regulatory compendium itself so as to offer operators and those who make daily use of this code a truly effective and above all immediate instrument Why am I saying this Minister thanking you for your key speech The work that has been done for this delegation is aimed at declining principles and rules that have been dragging on for many years These are rules that should have been implemented before If we ask someone today as he uses the code he knows that one party has been suspended for the intervention of the measure unblocks yards only up to the sub threshold then it went for derogation and something else intervened so the installation of this legislation has also been dismantled to the point that an impressive confusion has been created The measure in our examination declines a number of fundamental criteria but attention a piece is missing not to be in the same situation that we have already experienced If after the adoption of this measure the implementing decrees are not enacted this regulation with all the effort and work that has been done by the Commissions will remain here There is little time colleagues because the criteria contained in it will have to go to support the work of the PNRR which is coming In addition we have to face the high prices of raw materials a war that is almost inside the house and no longer on the doorstep a very difficult social situation a concept of peace that is drifting away If we want to be operational and really direct I ask the Government do n't happen what happened in 2016 when we had to align with the 2014 directives do n't happen again In 2022 we are still here to align ourselves with old situations that have not been taken into consideration this is the last chance we have After that our companies our operators all the stakeholders involved in these measures will be in a position to be unable to operate And not to be operational in the constancy of such dramatic situations means not to give Italy the opportunity to recover and to implement what we have all worked for together which we have approved and which in any case represents a debit for our future generations namely the PNRR The work was done by choosing a different much more limiting measure Now it is up to the Government to implement it in a short time by issuing its implementing decrees and to give the possibility of aligning ourselves like all countries with a European simplification regulation that we should already have This is crucial If we re-propose our thanks we shall vote in favour of the measure in the hope that we will not have to submit a question or a motion on it or worse still read the newspapers to hear us say

#AlessandriniValeria,Mr President members of the Government colleagues it was an important job a shared choral work and I would like to thank the Presidents the rapporteurs and all the Members of the 7th and 11th Commissions of which I am a member The approval of this bill which delegates the Government in the matter of entertainment is a first step towards the full recognition of the rights of workers in this sector since always unfortunately considered at least as far as legislative protections children of a minor god It was during the pandemic that we finally realized the need to make an in depth focus on this sector which was certainly among the most penalized by the crisis linked to the Covid The analysis of the situation has revealed poor legislation which guaranteed little or nothing those who work in the entertainment world with poor standards that did not fully protect the workers in the sector The work situation of the entertainment sector had to be looked at for a long time and deserved to be addressed in concrete terms We had the opportunity to finally take control of the situation by addressing the problems of workers in the sector and trying to solve them With this bill a first brick is put in place and the Government is delegated to provide for measures to carry out the reorganization of the laws and regulations on entertainment as well as the reorganization and revision of the shock absorbers allowances and temporary economic support instruments in favour of the workers in the sector enrolled in the pension fund workers of the show Measures are provided that restore dignity to those employed in this sector who qualify and professionalise the various figures who clearly regulate and frame the worker ensuring protection also in case of illness and giving guarantees for pension purposes In many cases unfortunately in the common imagination the worker of the artistic spectacle or culture is often assimilated to a hobbyist to the one who enjoys doing this type of activity or who does it pass me the phrase colored to lost time because he has another job with an income that allows him to live The subtitle of this concept is it has fun and fun while working not bad if it does not have the same guarantees as other workers This is absolutely dequalifying unfair and does not correspond to reality Those who come to provide an artistic performance most often do so after years of study sacrifices and trials with an important training behind them Wrongly as profanes we only consider the artist 's commitment only with regard to the hours in which he is engaged in the show or at the most extend his possible work involvement to the hours spent in the rehearsals Unfortunately in many cases when we talk about show we totally ignore the study and training that brings the artist to that particular performance To emerge in any sector including the artistic one it is not enough to have talent but there is a need for dedication and sacrifice Being prepared for a certain activity may possibly facilitate us but in order to move from being in power to becoming an act commodating the philosopher Aristotle there are years of study kilometres travelled exercises books consumed and all that follows The paradigm must be radically changed working in this sector is not a pastime and deserves the protection granted to other workers The measure that we are going to vote on today after a fruitful debate in the Commission in which we have managed to improve aspects in our opinion that are lacking begins to rearrange the sector in a way that is functional to the improvement of the quality of the services offered makes the protection for the providers of work and regularizes them I have taken action to introduce an important amendment to promote the entry into the labour market of young people studying subjects relevant to the sector I am referring to children with a diploma in higher secondary education who come from professional schools with an address in cultural and entertainment services and with courses related to fashion mechanics electronics electrical engineering and their ability to work in the entertainment industry For them we have asked to promote the activation of training and guidance internships also through the conclusion of special agreements with the professionals in the field of fashion and entertainment an additional piece to help them concretely enter this world This bill is a fundamental step in the path towards proper recognition and support and the definition of guarantees for workers in the entertainment world Let 's not just imagine the successful actor or the singer who fills the stadiums with his concerts let 's think about the workers those who work in the sector in a professional way those who engage daily carrying out their activities like any other worker in another sector those who have to work that mountain hours to get a decent salary There are thousands of professionals in theatre music cinema opera dance and all performing arts who will finally thanks to this legislation be able to count on new safeguards and guarantees This is the real first important and substantial intervention with regard to the entertainment sector We are at the side of the government and for this reason I thank the Ministers who have taken care of this work and in particular the Undersecretary for Culture Senator Lucia Borgonzoni who has personally paid for the drafting of this measure As a League we are very attentive to the problems of those who work in this sector and during the pandemic we have repeatedly urged interventions and refreshments to soothe the inevitable economic recession of the workers of the live show We are aware that this text does not fully meet the expectations of these workers but we are equally convinced that the path taken is the right one and that the Government and the Commission will work so that the situation in the future can improve significantly There must no longer be A and B workers because those who work in the entertainment sector in many cases feel abandoned to themselves and we can no longer allow

#LunesuMichelina,"LUNESU L SP PSd Az Mr President representative of the Government ladies and gentlemen the draft law under consideration was adopted at first reading by the House as has already been mentioned by my colleagues and it has now been improved with the passage to the Senate on precisely those aspects that could raise some critical issues We are talking about a very important issue health transparency The draft law contains the transparency and the right to knowledge of the relationships of economic importance or advantage between companies producing medicines tools equipment goods and services including non-health products and entities operating in the field of health including health organisations In recent years the principle of transparency has been deepened and analysed from many points of view In our party we are truly convinced that transparency is important and useful if it allows all citizens to know to understand the use of public resources to value their purposes the costs in relation to performance stimulating the appropriateness and the comparison between providers and territories encouraging the search for excellence identifying the responsibilities and the roles of every public and non-profit institutional subject The need for transparency could on more than one occasion clash with the right to data protection but in this respect there are many rules and provisions that intervene precisely in the fight against corruption and conflict of interest However a transparency rule must never be confused with a punitive rule That is not the point of the measure before the House today although we are aware that there are unclear situations which can sometimes also lead to corruption Measures such as this are aimed at strengthening the relationship of loyalty with citizens Accessibility to data and documents is also intended to protect citizens rights to promote the participation of those concerned in administrative activity and to promote widespread forms of control over the pursuit of institutional functions and the use of public resources There are many measures that go in this direction from the code of conduct of civil servants to the anti-corruption plan from the introduction of the pact of integrity between public ministers and companies participating in the tenders in Article 13 of the draft competition law in these days to the examination of the competent committees of the Senate With regard to Article 13 of the draft competition law which will have to arrive in the Chamber the aim of the PNRR is with regard to the provision of services at regional level in the health field to introduce more transparent modalities and criteria in the accreditation system in order to facilitate periodic verifications and reviews of the same on the qualitative results actually achieved by the operators These are all measures aimed at a timely tracking of resources in order to avoid possible conflicts of interest and to ensure that resources are allocated effectively In detail the provision transmitted by the Chamber of Deputies has been amended by providing for an increase in the amounts for which advertising is required It is therefore necessary to publish for each individual operator the utilities that have a unit value of more than 100 euros per single donation for a total annual total of more than 1,000 euros For each health organization on the other hand special advertising of payments or utilities with a unit value of more than 1,000 euros and up to 2,500 euros will have to be given In addition to this the changes introduced also provide for the publicity of any conventions For the rest the measure has remained essentially the one already approved by the colleagues of the House Surely the establishment of the public electronic register will play a fundamental role in the tracing of data and we therefore hope that the measure will really enter into force within six months of publication in the Official Journal which will take place after the subsequent passage of the measures to the Chamber of Deputies For all these reasons I declare the vote in favour of the measure of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione",#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,16.189625,-27.11671,41,"lunesu l sp

#LunesuMichelina,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government I would like to thank the two rapporteurs Senator Collina and Senator Ripamonti for having followed and brought to the House on a timely basis the measure that we are going to vote on today The aim of this draft law is to tackle a number of rules covering as many areas as possible local public services energy transport waste start up of business activities and market surveillance It is in practice a process of reform in order to bring us into line with Europe This is for example the mapping of concessions of goods in order to promote maximum publicity and transparency on port services the distribution of natural gas hydro- electric concessions which for all should have been started by 31 December 2022 With regard to state property concessions and management relationships for tourist recreational and sporting purposes the extension was granted on 31 December 2024 thanks to an amendment to the text with the amendment desired by the League It is important that the Government envisages the recognition of the actual commercial start up value of the companies net of the investments made over the years In practice work has been done to protect the nature of businesses even small and family run as the only source of income the recognition of the professional and technical experience of the sector for stability eco-sustainability the usability of structures by people with disabilities at the same time as respect for the environment and culture The right of pre-emption to existing dealers will also have to be guaranteed in order to protect the 30,000 families and 300,000 workers in the sector who have dedicated and currently devote their lives to the activities and services necessary for the well being of the environment and citizens I am referring in particular to the beaches It should be emphasized that our rapporteur has managed to remove from the text of the measure that award criterion for those who have experience in managing public goods that reminds me a little the so much criticized practice of the lawyer a legal instrument that allows to participate in the tenders without technical and professional requirements being able to use those of other companies The commitment of the League has been to bring reformulations to the text of the Government in order to guarantee to the outgoing concessionaire a fair compensation that will be paid by the successor concessionaire the sums to be paid recognized with the implementing decrees will be concerted with the enterprises of the field and this is a very important thing The opposition must play its role of stimulus and criticism but I think it is ingenious not to recognize the effort and work done by our representatives no one excluded who through their intervention have created the conditions to discourage and remove any speculators Another important area in my opinion is dealt with in Article 5 of the measure which concerns concessions of major hydropower The League is the author of a reformulation approved in the Commission confirming the regularisation of the hydroelectric sector At last enough with the attempt of some political forces to demolish one of the first concrete forms of autonomy of the Regions enough to benefit the concessionaires to the detriment of the citizens on the water charges with heavy erial damages to the mountain territories We as League have always fought these maneuvers With the reassignment of concessions by the Regions will finally be recognized appropriate fees to the mountain territories concerned environmental compensations free electricity supply After twenty years of stalemate a season of great investments will start to modernize and re-launch the hydroelectric It will give the impetus to the creation of the power plant network the installation of infrastructure by local authorities and motorway concessions with criteria for the selection of operators so that everything takes place in transparency Let 's say it 's a strategic asset for our nation to bet everything on energy from renewable sources and reduce our dependence on energy from abroad President on energy independence which is of great use at the moment I would like to draw the attention of the Government to one example the need to consider a project of absolute public benefit which has been financed with private funds and which has already obtained the environmental impact assessment EIA since 24 March 2021 It is the installation of a regasification terminal to the Port channel of Cagliari which awaits the understanding from the Sardinia Region demanded from the Ministry of the ecological transition It is a reminder that I first make to myself but it is necessary that all interested parties make an effort to speed up all those operations that can benefit In this case it is my Region but the growth will certainly be for the whole

#SaponaraMaria,SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister what we are debating here today is a very long awaited measure by the entertainment industry which is a sector which has been severely hampered by the pandemic and which is why it has received a great deal of attention from the members of the 7th Commission In fact it is after holding several hearings of the representatives of the sector precisely during the saddest period of the pandemic that the Committee on Culture decided to intervene in order to draw up legislation that the world of entertainment had been waiting for a long time in order to guarantee the right protection for a sector that has always lacked in safeguarding workers rights and also for this reason brought to its knees during the closing of the theatres and cinemas It has been since April last year that the Committees culture and work in joint session have gone to deepen a series of problems to be solved with the aim of giving a certain order and a fair protection to the workers of the show from the recognition of the professional figure of the artist to the more strictly contractual issues from the compensations to the discipline for a social security and insurance protection These are all themes highlighted in the various draft laws presented in the Commission on the subject with the aim of obtaining a unified text that would respond to the various needs highlighted by the workers of the show needs to which also the League with a draft law at the first signature of Senator Lucia Borgonzoni today Undersecretary for Culture has tried to give answers At the same time the Government has also moved so much so that in August again last year was assigned to the two Joint Commissions culture and work the bill delegates for the reorganization of the provisions in the matter of entertainment text related to the budget law As members of the Commissions we immediately began to examine the text that came to us from the Government in order to improve it and make those changes that fulfilled the commitments made with the workers of the show thus trying to introduce through amending proposals some of the norms contained in the bill of parliamentary initiative and in our opinion important This has been a long job which has committed us several months and to conclude that we have waited for the budget law and I will say why We have finally arrived today at the debate in the Chamber of the bill proposed by the Government which provides among other things the following news the reopening of the delegation to the Government in the matter of reordering the laws and regulations in force in the matter of entertainment the delegations to the Government for the reordering and revision of the shock absorbers and allowances for the introduction of an allowance of discontinuity as permanent structural allowance and for employment contracts as well as for the fair compensation for the self employed There will also be recognition of the profession of live entertainment agent the strengthening and expansion of the entertainment observatory and the establishment very important and awaited of the permanent table of the entertainment sector The draft law also provides for the establishment of the national register of performing workers In addition the INPS provides for specific information and communication services in favour of members of the entertainment workers pension fund in order to facilitate access to telematic services and services It is precisely with regard to the discontinuity allowance one of the rapporteurs amendments that there has been wide convergence of the members of the Commission The objective of this measure already present in the text of the League is to recognize the specific discontinuous nature of the creative professions The breaks allowance in fact recognizes the times of preparation training and study as integral parts of the actual working time because they are natural and indispensable for those who carry out a work in the performing arts This economic support was among the most discussed issues and for it the budget law was expected in order to understand what coverage was really possible We are aware that much more money would have been needed for this measure for which some 40 million are currently available In our opinion more could have been done since the National Insurance and Assistance Board ENPALS absorbed by the INPS were active every year as is apparent from a hearing in the Chamber 's meeting Commissions VII and XI of 11 November 2020 during which Professor Pasquale Tridico President of the INPS had stated that The pension expenditure remains lower than the contribution Hence a surplus that is generated from year to year for about 300 million up to a cumulative to date of approximately 5.4 billion Of course in the national accounting system the capital surplus of the entertainment workers pension fund helps to finance social security schemes in other sectors of production with deficit conditions I would like to stress starting with the conclusion of my speech that during the whole process of the measure under consideration the Lega Group shared and supported the amendments of the rapporteurs and that some of the amendments of the Lega Group were accepted which proposed the shortening of the delegation time from twelve to nine months at my signature and the possibility of carrying out training internships with professionals in the fashion and entertainment sector in favour of young people who have obtained a diploma in higher secondary education at professional institutions with cultural services and entertainment signed by Senator Alessandrini In addition Senator Rufa 's agenda was accepted which commits the Government to specify that the contribution obligation for wearers and photo models exists only and exclusively in the event that such professionals participate in events with an actual character of spectacularity and perform artistic activities directly related to the production and realization of the show In conclusion today we are going to vote on a measure which while not completely resolving all the problems relating to the entertainment sector we think has achieved an important result and content The favorable vote that also the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will give to the measure is also supported in the statements of some associations of the live show such as Assomusica who appreciated the improvements made by the Commissions regarding the issue of the construction of a first universal welfare for the workers of the supply chain and the recognition of the live clubs within the sector This delegation revives Law No. 175 of 2017 approved at the end of the last parliamentary term but unfortunately not implemented I thank the Ministers in particular Minister Franceschini who is present today the rapporteurs Senator Roberto Rampi and Senator Nunzia Catalfo the Presidents of the Commissions 7a and 11a the Commissioners for the shared work to achieve this result Of course I also thank Senator Lucia Borgonzoni State Secretary for Culture who has followed us with attention and passion throughout the journey for the importance and centrality of the workers of the entertainment world who deserve the right recognition Minister our country is great and recognized all over the world thanks also to the contribution professionalism and passion that these people put into what they do every day and as such are our great heritage to protect The hope Minister is that the delegated decrees will now be issued as quickly as possible so as not to miss yet another opportunity to regulate a sector that has been waiting too long for reform,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,18.320671,-25.530453,41,saponara l sp psd az mr president ladies gentlemen minister

#RomeoMassimiliano,ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President by announcing the vote in favour of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group on the measure under consideration we would like to highlight two important aspects because the draft competition law does not only concern what the newspapers have highlighted in the last period namely the theme of bathing but many others such as transport health hydropower in short many important and strategic sectors for our territories as well as the story of bathing made known by the media We are talking about a point that we consider to be fundamental and on which the League had already demonstrated itself in this House with Law No 135 of 2018 which finally gave the opportunity to move towards the renewal of the expired concessions of the major hydroelectric derivations giving a very important signal to the territories In the measure under discussion there is confirmation that these renewal procedures will be carried out with great support to the territories especially the mountainous ones moreover it has also been thought of the hydroelectric which especially in the light of the fact that there is so much talk of renewable sources is perhaps the cleanest energy source that there is and does not need to have large invades Moreover it is an energy that can be programmed over time and is not like wind which depends on the presence of wind or like photovoltaics which depends on the presence of the sun it is constant and can be programmed and this is fundamental We are not just talking about the issues that generate controversy we must also emphasize important results that go to the territory more appropriate canons environmental compensation and all things that benefit our territories which is what the League has always said and for which it has always fought This is an issue that we wanted to highlight In order not to go too far I would like to turn to the other subject which has been the subject of controversy namely that of the beaches Some argue that there is no coherence in the action that the Government and that some political forces have taken forward We as League put consistency on this issue when we did Law No. 145 of 2018 with the then Minister Gian Marco Centinario I was a signatory to an amendment along with my colleague Mr Ripamonti which gave ample time to arrive at public evidence we had set a deadline for 2033 with a whole series of paths to be made such as mapping and checking whether the resource was scarce or not There were a whole series of principles which had borne the impact of the European Commission 's observations then Minister Centinario had done this What happens next Time passes and let us not forget this and let us not hide it comes a decision of the Council of State which deletes this law That is the question we have to ask ourselves why do the magistrates come to say that a law is good or not good They should just apply it not interpret it Instead this interpretation came with a very close deadline 2023 Therefore it is not the fault of the League if the decision of the Council of State that establishes that by the end of 2023 there must be new assignments and public evidence must be made In the light of this judgment the Government had to take note of this and put forward proposals In hearing the associations there were three main issues on which it was necessary to fight the associations and the bathing establishments asked three things noted that one could not help but apply this decision of the Council of State Of course then there is a whole new case law because now there is the TAR of Lecce that has returned to the European Court but these are all issues that we will then consider always ready to intervene in the light of new judgments and new aspects at the judicial level We took note of the fact that at the moment it was important to intervene to protect companies because if we had not done anything there was only the decision of the Council of State and no one would have protected anyone I said there were three principles The first principle is rewards to protect micro small and medium sized enterprises especially in order to protect those who have a dominant source of income resulting from the fact that they have this concession Then there was the question of the transitional period because we remind everyone that the races are made by the municipalities which must be put in a position to intervene also at the organizational level However we have seen with the PNRR that there are difficulties money often comes but we do not have the people who do the projects because Europe 's austerity policies have not given the opportunity to replace people especially employees officials and experts Let 's say all this is austerity these are the results of austerity At some point the municipalities may need a little more time in fact this period is guaranteed within the norm The third question concerns the famous fair compensation those who take over must of course pay compensation to those who leave the concession because there are the business and the value of the company This compensation must also protect the tradition of our territory and everything else As a proxy law we had to incorporate these three principles Go and see in the provision at least we tell everyone inside these three principles are sanctioned by law and by way of derogation from the code of navigation there is also the possibility of resorting to project financing as provided by the code of contracts That too must be said and emphasized As far as the transitional period is concerned we will then check because it is also dictated by the disputes that exist so we will see what happens Secondly clear rewards because at the end of the day when small and family businesses are protected 70 of the companies present in our territory are given the opportunity to protect them This is a sacrosanct principle written black on white in the law Then we will go to the bathing establishments with the text of the law to show what is written because too many fakes turn on the chats which tell what you want to tell You have to look and read to see what it says Then there is the issue of compensation Certainly the associations are not happy because they would have preferred the compensation rule to be written in full However we reiterate that this is a delegated law which as such can sanction the principle How do we do in the law it was here the difficulty to contemplate all the existing cases in our country It would have been impossible and in two months we 'd still be there I thank Vice Minister Pichetto Fratin colleagues from Forza Italia Senators Gasparri and Mallegni Senator Marti who is near here and the rapporteurs Ripamonti and Collina because there has also been a common commitment and work from other parts How do we define all these cases so that we do not stay here for three months and risk lengthening time and putting the draft competition law at risk since clearly that is not our objective We decided to establish the principle and then move on to the legislative decree I shall conclude Mr President Of course the Ministers concerned by this measure are many and it is not just one they will do well to open a table with the associations write compensation properly and resolve this situation once and for all No more European infringements but certainty investment possibilities and finally protection for these companies which have lived in uncertainty for too many years This was our commitment and the real goal and we are not afraid to go around telling it For these reasons the vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will be firmly in favour,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,18.82935,-33.707973,41,romeo l sp psd az mr president announcing vote favour lega salvini premier partito sardo

#RufaGianfranco,"RUFA L SP PSd Az Mr President the League votes in favour of the bill of delegation to the Government on the code of public contracts and it is also the case not to delay in order to avoid possible European infringement procedures However these are the aims that must make us rush towards the favorable vote considering that it is deburocratic simplifies rationalizes optimizes and then we proceed to close a path of completion of planning and resolution since long started We in the League have structured principles and criteria such as as Mr Corti has already said avoiding gold plating a qualification of contracting stations and active staff the participation of small and medium sized enterprises especially local ones in unpacked contracts and also in forms of public private partnership priority is given to Italian materials and investments in green and digital technology It is also expected that prices will be revised especially now that the costs of energy and fuels are conditional on the value of revenue It is also envisaged to include specific social clauses as well as insurance policies for internal personnel in the design to be carried out by the administration there is the rationalization of sanctioning and rewarding mechanisms as well as the reduction of the tendering times and the conclusion of the contract then there are appropriate timings also for the application of the minimum environmental criteria There are specific qualitative and social criteria for catering A call for tenders with award to the most expensive offer sometimes also means better product and savings over time as we have considered in school canteens where food teaching so a higher cost has become necessary as evidenced by the growing problem of child obesity in schools The League with a series of agendas also wanted to enhance the experience of technical directors and also required an Italian digital construction platform The aim is therefore to accelerate stimulate simplify and optimise the entire public contract chain reducing rules problems and time to address not only the PNRR but also the smallest municipal ban With clear rules there will be fewer disputes fewer appeals more confidence and savings for the State and thus more attractiveness for foreign countries will also be achieved in fact the structural and managerial advantages of investments pass through clear and therefore fast public contracts Today the League is in the government for businesses for entrepreneurs for professionals for workers and for those who have already worked Our task is to simplify and allow everyone to participate but it is the meritocracy that is at the root of these intentions In addition to certain rules I believe that we must have the concept of respect for doing and hunger in the broad sense that is the hunger to grow the hunger for work and the hunger to become protagonists in Italy With certain rules we will be able to stimulate businesses entrepreneurs and above all workers Then there is the sense of duty At times great conquests lead to unexpected or unwanted consequences and some achievements in social and civil rights have had a devastating effect on duty Today we live in the age of rights fixed positions guaranteed wages screaming and demanding That is what Marchionne said who did not even know the income of citizenship at the time who concluded that rights are sacred and must be protected but if we continue to live on rights alone we will die This is our task therefore awaken from this moment of anesthesia especially those young people who expect only the income of citizenship and who still live voluntarily on the shoulders of their parents The will of the League is also to lighten the enterprises from debitorial folders that for the State are spent and for the enterprises only impediment impediment to open a current account to work and to dream of being able to realize enterprise To facilitate this freedom we need a fiscal peace and a new breakdown of the records The League has repeatedly recalled that in 2020 and 2022 at least 530,000 taxpayers have failed to pay respecting the installment plan granted by the tax while there are 15 million Italians with at least one pending debitory folder although 80 of these are under 1,000 euros Why then be bitter On the other hand the 0.2 that exceeds 100,000 euros was controlled The State we must give tranquillity and be an accomplice to those who invest in the enterprise and not tartaxare and seek at all costs tricks to fine It is the enterprises that give future to the families and despite difficulties they never back down It is news of yesterday that Diego and Matteo of Guidizzolo owners of a metal company aware of the expensive bills fuel and food costs have donated a bonus expense to their 17 employees accompanied by the phrase We want to thank you This is the Italian company If the League were to leave the Government some parties would complete what today with us can only dream namely the taxation of those goods that by their own sacrifice every man builds for his own family that is to say the house and the savings With regard to the measure the League wants salaries adapted to the cost of living and attention to changing contracts today higher than the minimum wage assumed We want to support businesses and we consider it mortifying to those who work a citizenship income that is now inappropriate for most people It is to be reviewed and instead it is necessary to voucher or in any case tools of entry to work safe guaranteed and fast as in the world of agriculture and tourism especially at this time The League is always there when it is necessary to shake the consciences of those who passively wait for work and when it is necessary to guarantee certainties to those who want to work That is why we are also in favour of this measure today",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#PergreffiSimona,Mr President first of all I should like to thank Deputy Minister Bellanova for the support he has given at this time on a rather complicated measure but at the same time he has had a good development thanks to all the members of the 8th Commission to the Group leaders to the President and to the Commission 's legislative offices which have done a great deal The draft law of governmental initiative consists of a single article and gives a delegation to the Government to adopt within six months one or more legislative decrees with the discipline of public contracts The purpose of the draft law consisting of a single article is to simplify rationalise and reorder the rules on public contracts and to avoid the initiation of infringement procedures by the European Commission and to reach the resolution of those already initiated The draft law lists the principles and guiding criteria to be followed by the Government and among them the need to avoid gold plating the forecasting and redefinition of the qualification of the contracting stations and their staff the simplification of the rules applicable to public contracts for works services and supplies exceeding the thresholds of European relevance the simplification of procedures for the realisation of investments in green digital innovation and research technologies including for the achievement of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the reduction and certainty of the time limits for the tendering and conclusion of contracts and the execution of contracts the revision and simplification of the procedures for the approval of projects in the field of public works the incentive for the use of flexible procedures for the conclusion of complex public contracts of long duration the simplification of the extension of public private partnership forms with particular regard to project finance the identification of public contracts excluded from the scope of the European directives and the simplification of the legal discipline applicable to them the prohibition of the extension of the arrangements for the extension of public private partnership with regard to the implementation of contracts for the implementation of contracts for the purposes of which have been extended and the implementation of contracts to be subject to be subjected the implementation of contracts for the implementation of contracts which have been subjected and the implementation of the implementation of contracts with regard to be subject to be subject to the conditions of the conditions of contracts for the conditions of contracts for granting to which have been subject to be extended the conditions of contracts for the conditions for granting to be extended and to be extended to be extended the implementation of contracts for granting of contracts for granting of contracts for granting of contracts for granting to be subject to be subject to be subject to which have been concluded the conditions of contracts for granting of contracts for granting the conditions of contracts for granting the conditions of contracts for granting the conditions of contracts for

conditions of contracts for the conditions of contracts for granting to be subject to be subject to be subject to be extended the conditions of contracts for granting to be determined the conditions for granting the conditions of contracts for granting to be determined the implementation the implementation the implementation of contracts for granting the conditions of contracts for granting the conditions of contracts for granting of contracts for granting of contracts and It is established that the legislative decrees thus adopted expressly repeal all the provisions under review and in any case those related to them incompatible and make appropriate coordination provisions in relation to provisions not repealed or not modified The thorough work carried out by the 8th Commission on this measure which began last autumn included a comprehensive round of hearings of the main players in the sector and led to the adoption of 83 amendments which together made some 30 amendments to the text This amending activity was inspired by a method shared in the Commission in the early stages of the debate aimed at meeting the need to define more precisely the principles and guiding criteria of the delegation with the intention not to overburden the text In the course of the examination in particular some issues have emerged which have seen a broad convergence of the majority groups often even with the opposition in a fruitful dialogue with the Government Firstly the need to encourage the participation of micro small and medium sized enterprises has been shared by including an indication in this respect already in the first steering criterion and then introducing a specific steering criterion aimed at providing for the possibility of dividing contracts on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria and the prohibition of artificial aggregation of lots in line with the principles of small business act also in order to enhance the value of neighbouring companies Another theme that given the particular historical moment we are experiencing could not but be the subject of particular attention is that of the price review The wording on which it was finally possible to agree provides for the requirement for contracting stations to include in calls for tenders notices and invitations in relation to the different types of public contracts a compulsory price review regime when particular conditions of an objective and non-predictive nature occur at the time the tender is made establishing that any charges arising from the above mentioned price review mechanism are based on the resources available from the economic framework of the interventions and on any other resources available for the purchasing station to be used in accordance with the accounting procedures for expenditure Another issue on which wide convergence has been observed has been the prohibition for contracting stations with reference to contracts below the thresholds of European importance to use for the selection of operators to be invited to the negotiated procedures the draw or other random method of names if not in the case of specific or specifically motivated situations Scrolling through the regulatory article among the various changes made there are also the following with reference to the prohibition of gold plating it has been specified that the unrogability of measures to protect the work safety the contrast to irregular work legality and transparency remains firm A reference to the different types of public contracts has been inserted regarding the redefinition of the secondary discipline regime As regards the qualification of contracting stations a reference has been inserted to the monitoring of the aggregation and reorganisation of contracting stations and the forecast of specific training courses with particular reference to the single contracting stations and the purchasing power stations operating at the service of local authorities A new letter was inserted to promote in compliance with European law the use by contracting stations of supplies in that part of products originating in third countries which make up the offer which is not major in relation to the total value of the products New guiding principles with respect to the original text concern the rationalization and simplification of the causes of exclusion in order to make clear and certain the rules of participation the provision in the case of entrusting the tasks of design to internal staff to contracting authorities of the signing of specific insurance policies for the coverage of risks of a professional nature with burdens on the same administrations the definition of the rules applicable to public contracts in the field of research and development services As regards the qualification of operators a reference has been inserted to the adequacy of technical equipment and staff The Commission has also introduced a new delegation criterion aimed at redefining the rules governing the variants in progress within the limits laid down by the European law in relation to the possibility of amending contracts during the implementation phase Another novelty compared to the original draft law concerns the revision of the rules on social services hospital welfare and school catering as well as labour intensive ones providing as a criterion that can be used for the purposes of the award only that of the most economically advantageous offer The Commission also considered it appropriate to mention in the text framework agreements service concessions the financial lease of public works or utilities A revision of the guarantee system for the participation and execution of public contracts was also envisaged providing for the possibility in relation to the guarantees for the execution of contracts to replace them by carrying out a guarantee withholding proportionate to the amount of the contract at the time of the payment of each progress of the works In the field of concessions it is expected that concessions in place and not entrusted with the form of project finance i.e. with public evidence tendering procedures in accordance with European Union law with specific regard to the situations in which there is an obligation in accordance with criteria of graduality and proportionality and taking into account the size characteristics of the concessionaire the time of allocation of the concession its duration the object and its economic value to entrust to third parties through public evidence procedures part of the contracts of works services and supplies relating to the same concessions ensuring the stability of the staff employed and the safeguarding of professionalism Finally a new delegation criterion has been introduced specifically dedicated to the simplification of payment procedures by contracting stations of the contract fee including by reducing the administrative burden on businesses,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,16.813684,-32.04143,41,mr president first like thank deputy minister bellanova support given time rather complicated measure

#PergreffiSimona,Mr President first of all I would like to stress my thanks to Mr Bellanova who as always was present in the proceedings and to the rapporteur Senator Cioffi for the work he has done We are at the third reading the draft law on public contracts approved by this House on 9 March and then amended to the House of Deputies returns to the Senate First the House intervened on two provisions inserted by the Senate at first reading to protect small and medium sized enterprises In point a of paragraph 2 it has been specified that the opening of competition to the competitive comparison between the different operators must concern in particular in addition to small and medium sized enterprises also micro-enterprises In addition the guiding principle set out in point d inserted by this branch of Parliament in order to encourage the participation of micro and small enterprises has been supplemented by the provision of premium criteria for the aggregation of undertakings as well as the obligation to justify the decision not to divide into lots by the contracting station In point a it was also stated that when implementing the delegation account should also be taken of the specific nature of contracts in the special sectors with the aim of enhancing the specific nature of such contracts The Chamber then introduced the new governing criterion referred to in point b aimed at the revision of the competences of the DAC in the matter of public contracts in order to strengthen its functions of supervision in the field and of support to the contracting stations Also with regard to the competences of the DAC in point m it was also provided that the authority would prepare standard contracts after consulting the Council of Public Works regarding the contracts type of works and services of engineering and architecture Among the principles to be respected in contracts under threshold was also that of rotation in the procedures of choice of the contractor The simplification of procedures for the realisation of investments in green and digital technologies as well as in innovation and research as provided for in point f has been accompanied by procedures for the realization of investments in social innovation Among the conditions of an objective nature not foreseeable at the time of the formulation of the offer which determine the revision of the prices pursuant to point g the variation of the cost resulting from the renewal of the national collective agreements of employment applicable in relation to the object of the contract and the services to be followed also in a prevailing way has been expressly included In point h first it was provided that contracting stations should be given the right to participate in procurement procedures and concession procedures for economic operators whose main purpose is the social and professional integration of persons with disabilities or disadvantaged persons A reference to disadvantaged people has also been included with regard to equal opportunities under 3 Secondly the mandatory inclusion of social clauses to guarantee and not only to promote as the original text of the draft law stated the employment stability of employees Similarly in point v it has been provided that in the case of social services and catering in hospitals hospitals and schools as well as those with a high labour density invitations to tender notices and invitations must contain the provision of specific social clauses aimed at promoting the employment stability of the staff employed In the case of supplies from non-EU countries measures should be taken to ensure compliance with minimum environmental criteria workers rights including in order to ensure fair competition with economic operators in European countries The new governing criterion referred to in point l shall prohibit the free provision of professional activities except in exceptional cases and subject to appropriate reasons The House then reworded the guiding criterion on the simplification of the phase of approval of the projects in letter q making the redefinition of the design levels more binding in order to reduce them In point aa on the rationalisation simplification and extension of forms of public private partnership the forecast of standard contracts has also been included In the field of integrated procurement in point ee it has been clarified that the necessary qualification for the preparation of the projects remains firm as well as the obligation to indicate in the tender documents or invitations how the contracting company pays directly to the designer the proportion of the compensation corresponding to the design charges expressly indicated in the tender of the economic operator net of the auction reduction this was a great battle carried out by the Commission here in the Senate An explicit reference to the acceleration of the procedures was added to the governing criterion for the simplification of the procedures for the payment of the contract by the contracting stations introduced in the text during the examination of the Senate Finally with reference to the procedure for adopting the legislative decrees implementing the delegation paragraph 4 has been clarified that as usual the Chambers will express themselves on the relative schemes after the Council of State and the unified Conference have expressed themselves The Commission in its analysis has not made any further changes considering that the two previous readings have enabled a good balance to be achieved as the adoption of the measure under consideration by 30 June constitutes one of the PNRR 's objectives for 2022 PRESIDENT The debate is I call the rapporteur Senator

#PergreffiSimona,Mr President I would just like to point out to this House that as far as the maximum reduction is concerned which has been the subject of Senator De Bertoldi 's intervention it has been made clear within the delegation law that there will be an identification of the hypotheses in which contracting stations can use automation in the assessment and typing of cases where they can only use the price or cost criterion with the possibility of excluding anonymous offers in any case and providing in any case that the costs of labour and safety must always be disembedded by the amounts subject to decrease I think that a clearer prediction of this cannot be written within a delegated law so it seems to me that the concerns of Senator De Bertoldi are protected from this point of view Even with regard to exclusion from calls for tender much work has been done within the Commission in the Senate still rationalising and simplifying the rules which must be clear and certain for the identification of the cases that constitute the wrongdoing Therefore from this point of view too I think that we can be satisfied with the way Parliament has worked and in this case the Senate I also remember that everything about the procurement code is necessary all the more so today that we are facing challenges as has been reiterated in some speeches We really hope that the bureaucratic passages can be simplified and brought back to a certain time as business demands Moreover this demand comes not only from companies but also from our administrations I am thinking above all of the smaller municipalities Certain times are needed with regard to bureaucracy without forgetting that the economic recovery of Italy certainly passes from the great interventions but also from the small interventions that will be on our territory I therefore believe that this is a great opportunity a great opportunity and I really think that what has been done in the Senate and in the House is a good job and I really hope as has been said before that these hopes will be realized in the implementing decrees,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,14.421725,-32.269867,41,mr president would like point house far maximum reduction concerned subject senator de bertoldi 's intervention made clear within delegation law identification hypotheses contracting stations use automation assessment typing cases use price cost criterion possibility excluding anonymous offers case providing case costs labour safety must always disembedded amounts subject decrease think clearer prediction cannot written within delegated law seems concerns senator de bertoldi protected point view even regard exclusion calls tender much work done within commission senate still rationalising simplifying rules must clear certain identification cases constitute wrongdoing therefore point view think satisfied way parliament worked case senate also remember everything procurement code necessary today facing challenges reiterated speeches really hope bureaucratic passages simplified brought back certain time business demands moreover demand comes companies also administrations thinking smaller municipalities certain times needed regard bureaucracy without forgetting economic recovery italy certainly passes great interventions also small interventions territory therefore believe great opportunity great opportunity really think done senate house good job really hope said hopes realized implementing decrees
#CortiStefano,Madam President Madam Vice Minister before entering into the substance of the measure I would once again like to thank the rapporteurs Senator Pergreffi and Senator Cioffi who have worked closely on the complex issue of delegation to the Government in the field of public contracts Our contribution as a League to simplify the discipline governing public contracts aims to ensure clarity and support for our productive activities The draft law under discussion then lists the principles and guiding criteria to be followed by the Government I should like to make a few brief comments on this avoiding gold plating or the process whereby a European Union directive is extended for transposition into the national laws of a Member State This is a matter for which the League of Government has spent a great deal to ensure that the protection of work security the fight against illegal work legality and therefore transparency remains firm We have also included a redefinition of the qualification of contracting stations and their staff We have given impetus to the participation of micro and small enterprises in procurement I continue to list the contribution of the League for the simplification of the discipline applicable to public contracts services and supplies of less than the thresholds of European importance the simplification of the procedures for the realization of investments in green and digital technologies the provision of a compulsory regime for the revision of prices on the occurrence of particular conditions not predictable as well as for cases of renewal of the national collective agreement the provision of the obligation for contracting stations to include in the calls for tenders specific social clauses in order to ensure the occupational stability of the staff employed and the application of national and territorial collective agreements in the field in order to promote equal opportunities and therefore the occupational inclusion for persons with disabilities I stress these measures because we have contributed to the inclusion of very important and relevant clauses for small businesses I am referring to the review of prices which has already been mentioned and therefore to the possibility of adjusting the price paid to companies in the event of exceptional and unforeseen events and also to the possibility of dividing contracts into lots as well as the simplification of payment procedures and the reduction of administrative burdens on companies and the speeding up of the procedures for payment of the contract fee to undertakings by contracting stations Even more however we have focused on the development of neighbouring companies based on premium criteria for the aggregation of enterprises On a proposal from the League a rule has been adopted that makes explicit the principle of the prescription provided for in the Code of Public Contracts on the protection and promotion of Made in Italy thus strengthening the dissuasive scope of the norm and inserting a sanction that discourages offers containing a majority share of products originating in third countries Always in a shared and proactive way we have obtained the conclusion of insurance policies for internal personnel in charge of design and at the expense of the administrations It should not be remembered moreover that thanks to our proposals a new discipline has passed of the recourse to the draw and that thanks to the League it will have to be strongly limited and regulated because it would be a mechanism that degrades the qualification acquired to the enterprises Thanks to our contribution there is the rule that with regard to the provision of minimum environmental criteria they must be respected differentiated by types and amounts of contracts also preparing a transitional period following the issuing of ministerial decrees with adequate time for the start of their application Let us not forget our battle which provides for the possibility for contracting stations to resort to automation in the evaluation of bids where no improvements are necessary to the project and in this case the lowest price criterion can be used Moreover among the principles of delegation the redefinition of an ad hoc regulation for collective catering is also fixed given the high social value represented by this sector It is true before Mr Mallegni mentioned the unusuality of the third passage to the Senate It does not happen very often also because ultimately the discussion of the provision in the House took place in a climate of general sharing of the line of government and did not want to weigh down the text already approved by the Senate The new parts introduced by the House mainly concern the social sector collective labour agreements disadvantaged people some insights into design and professionals and also the promotion of the aggregation of micro and small enterprises and the specificity of contracts in the special sectors Mr President let me add as a militant of the League for over thirty years since I was a boy that the League has always represented the productive class the class that has always created wealth The League has always distinguished itself to be the trade union of companies the trade union of professionals the trade union of VAT matches This was thirty years ago and this is still today And this is the proof Mr President times are difficult for our economy The well being of the territories passes through the creation of work work work and work For a really good recovery it is necessary to simplify the purchase procedures in order finally to realize the necessary infrastructures for the revival of the building activity both essential aspects for the recovery following the pandemic and the war unfortunately ongoing Colleagues the League is in the government for the good of businesses and its professionals If we were not there we could not complete ideas and requests that could give answers certainties and planning for the future of our fellow citizens That 's why we fight and stand tall,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo

#CantuMariaCristina,Mr President we are going to examine at third reading a measure which with regard to Article 15 has an inherent criticality already noted by one of the most important trade associations because it is not treated in the same way as the public and private distributors in the new system of evaluation monitoring and control of health and social health benefits Since this vulnus was not passed during the examination in the Chamber removing in the title the words private after structures and private after distributors as we repeatedly requested in the majority meetings and as well technically highlighted in the dossier studies in Chamber and Senate acts Since this is a mere material error we propose to remedy it irrationally with an interpretative agenda or with other measure deemed appropriate promoted by the Government as it is absolutely essential to foreshadow a scenario that takes into account the obvious disparity in the treatment of the different distributors in contrast to European regulations since rules of quality safety and appropriateness applicable to all structures according to principles of objective traceability responsibility and transparency I hope that you will welcome this latest call thereby avoiding future distortions of application and unnecessary recourses,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,15.820574,-28.501043,41,mr president going examine third reading measure regard article 15 inherent criticality already noted one important trade associations treated way public private distributors new system evaluation monitoring control health social health benefits since vulnus passed examination chamber removing title words private structures private distributors repeatedly requested majority meetings well technically highlighted dossier studies chamber senate acts since mere material error propose remedy irrationally interpretative agenda measure deemed appropriate promoted government absolutely essential foreshadow scenario takes account obvious disparity treatment different distributors contrast european regulations since rules quality safety appropriateness applicable structures according principles objective traceability responsibility transparency hope welcome latest call thereby avoiding future distortions application unnecessary recourses
#MaffoniGianpietro,Mr President ladies and gentlemen senators government representatives there is no doubt that many categories of workers have paid a huge price for the pandemic aggravated by ineffective government choices and many times without a sound scientific basis This morning too we discussed it during the examination of the other measure The debate on this issue is more topical than ever since unlike other European countries and in full respect of the indications coming from scientific communities which no one questions we are currently subject to restrictions that no government imposes abroad It is also clear ladies and gentlemen that one of the categories that has suffered most in recent months has been workers and workers of the show for whom we are probably here to decide a measure that is so necessary but characterized by a guilty delay In addition to the lack of concrete aid from the State during the recent pandemic there is also a constant lack of protection for workers belonging to a sector that it should be said is a decisive part of our cultural heritage It is enough to look at the data to understand that one in five workers no longer works in the entertainment sector compared to a few months ago they are mainly workers and workers who dealt with the organization and set up an invisible but nevertheless fundamental phase of any entertainment and recreational activity To be honest the lack of protection is in fact well before the pandemic because for years the last successive governments have decided to abandon the workers and workers of this precious sector This is of course not good for those who lend their work nor for those who are willing to invest in this sector Until there are concrete safeguards unfortunately it is natural to think that there will be an even greater exodus from this area or further difficulties which could lead to a fall in wages and salaries with a final fall in the sensitive issues of safety at work The issue of safety at work is a fundamental one I also say this because I am Vice President of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into working conditions exploitation and safety in public and private workplaces The lack of discipline in this field favours only precarious working conditions and although the controls prior to Expo 2015 have generated a significant decrease in the so called white deaths in the sector now the data are becoming alarming again In addition ladies and gentlemen we are at the dawn of a season of very important events the first after the spread of the pandemic therefore we must be ready to secure the hundreds and thousands of workers in this sector In short that Italy lives also of culture is known so we of Brothers of Italy struggle to understand how the Governments driven by the 5 Star Movement first and the so called Government of the best then even though with a vast majority have neglected these problems until today Taking up the punctual words of our President Giorgia Meloni we are here to make a serious and constructive opposition I would also like to stress that we are not the party of the no as someone wants to paint us However on this very important issue too our demands especially our proposals and our amendments have remained as always unheard of It is therefore with regret for the umpteenth missed opportunity that we of Brothers of Italy will abstain on the measure under consideration,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,18.40581,-24.746254,41,mr president ladies gentlemen senators government
