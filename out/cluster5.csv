#RodrigoJiménezRevuelta,With all due respect Madam President Ladies and gentlemen good morning Minister dear Carmen and other guests today we are debating the adoption of the emerging business bill better known as startups During its parliamentary procedure quite a number of amendments have been incorporated although none by the way of this parliamentary group but some of the other groups that shared the same purpose as those tabled by VOX The first amendment tabled by this parliamentary group concerned the elimination within the explanatory statement of the law of the inclusion once again of the so called gender gap which is nothing more than an ideological term which the left uses as a mantra in a supposed defence of women to whom however ladies and gentlemen they do not defend indeed a term used by Mr Píriz in his speech in the Commission stating that one in five entrepreneurs are women Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party you will never change Then it bothers them when we tell them that they are part of the consensus progress but it is that they always buy the speech on the left because I ask them whether there is any impediment to women being entrepreneurial because of their sex as Mr Píriz said in the Commission or if on the contrary what exists is lack of support for women who are mothers and who have more difficulties in reconciling their family life Ladies and gentlemen what exists in Spain today is the maternal gap There is no wage difference because of being a woman what exists is discrimination because of having children What should be done is to reward the hiring of parents in businesses and the protection of the family If you do not believe me I refer you to the report by the Banco de España whose conclusions are devastating I warned that the maternity pay gap was 28 Under no circumstances is the word gender mentioned a term by the way used sibilically by the left to criminalize man And to subscribe the statements of Olivia 's father my dear friend Eugenio to whom I was able to accompany this Tuesday in Segovia to fire his murdered daughter allegedly at the hands of her mother manifesting listen well your lordships that this is not of men and women but of good and bad The feminist perspective must disappear from any legal text and from our lives forever Only by the inclusion of ideological terms would this bill deserve our disapproval But it is no less true that the sector is quite satisfied with the bill and we must acknowledge that the text of the law has been improved albeit not sufficiently This is mainly due to the method used by the Government vetoing 57 of the 271 amendments tabled using a totalitarian approach and without any legal basis Firstly because amendments affecting the decrease in income and a generic concept are being vetoed without determining exactly what heading such an amendment would be concerned with And in addition it is being done on the future benefit when it should be the current benefit because the decrease in budgetary revenue is not a fact that is likely to be certain but a fact of probability Secondly because there is a distortion of the very raison d'être of the power of the veto of the Government recognized in article 134.6 of the Spanish Constitution since the aforementioned power of the Government is exercised as it is exercised in the proceedings has to be examined by the Chamber And there is lewdness on the part of the groups in accepting the vetoes undermining the legislative powers of the Congress so that this recently executed practice by the Government is preventing the parliamentary groups from carrying out their functions as has happened in the paper and in the Commission And thirdly because there is no precedent in the history of this House for vetoing amendments that affect the decline in income when it is also an estimate As the Government has raised an additional 28 billion up to September by breaking its forecasts there is no point in vetoing amendments that affect a tax such as for example the IRPF because because of the elasticity of this tax the application of a deduction in the IRPF may result in higher collection and higher revenues This practice must be denounced as another element of this Government which manages the institutions at its own discretion Ladies and gentlemen tell me what is the point then of parliamentary groups submitting amendments Is n't it logical with a startup law to introduce amendments that affect tax laws And if they do is n't it logical that they can lower income Also on the contrary it may happen that a deduction for example in IRPF increases them Do you ladies and gentlemen agree to apply a practice that can be used by future governments I have already told you that this parliamentary group will initiate the necessary legal measures to determine whether or not the veto on the amendments is in line with the law Ladies and gentlemen it turns out that some of the vetoed amendments proposed an ostensible improvement of the law including increasing from five to seven or from seven to twelve if they are biotechnological the years to be considered startups increasing the base of deduction in IRPF for investment in startups from EUR 100 000 to EUR 1 million increasing the limit of own funds to be considered startups from EUR 400 000 to EUR 1 million increasing for example the three to five year period for the application of the 15 tax rate on company tax on startups or reducing the tax on certain digital services from 3 to 1.5 to taxpayers in Ceuta and Melilla In total the budgetary impact of the above mentioned amendments which the Government vetoed amounts to EUR 128 million i.e. almost EUR 130 million the same amount that Mr Sánchez has promised to give to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation behind the back of the Spanish and less than the more than EUR 150 million that has been reserved for the Presidency of Europe Ladies and gentlemen it is an unprecedented act of hypocrisy and phariseeism by a government that vetoes illegal amendments amendments that could have improved this law for entrepreneurs SMEs self employed people and investors For Sánchez 's wishes there is no money to help them but there is money for his whims and delusions of power when it comes to promoting himself and who knows if perhaps also preparing for his departure Ladies and gentlemen when we govern we will repeal all ideological laws on the first day and return to the Spaniards the place they deserve and should never lose Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,23.497175,15.017247,5,due respect madam president ladies gentlemen good morning minister dear carmen guests today debating adoption emerging business bill

#JuanLuisSteegmannOlmedillas,"With venial Mr. President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Today we are presented for our consideration with a proposal for a law that was registered by the People 's Parliamentary Group last March The proposed law has five pages with the explanatory statement sixteen articles four additional provisions one transitional and one final entry into force In addition it has an unfortunate name it is called a bill on violence in the health field It is unfortunate because the People 's Parliamentary Group in its explanatory statement says that the problem that is to be solved is a cause and I quote textually in which health professionals are especially exposed to aggression and situations of violence and that it is an occupational danger that must be prevented and avoided Therefore this proposal for a law should have been called a proposal for a law on violence against health personnel not only because this name does describe the object of the proposal but because it comes out of the fraudulent and tortuous use made by the left of the term violence We know that the left uses in its propaganda the National Socialist principle of transposition whose name in German I do n't remember for example accusing the victim of having the intention to attack the murderer We see every day in this House how the crimes are justified and how the friends of convicts pander before us For the communist all he opposes to his ends is violence Ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People 's Party you should already know that because you have been abusing yourselves for decades So you should be careful to use such ambiguous names since the left makes continuous incursions in this area to give the message that health professionals exercise for example violence against women Although from a laughable point of view it is not innocent that Mrs Calvo insinuated that doctors in the 1970s arbitrarily removed the vesicle and of course of course not Francois From the most sinister bank the extreme left insists on denouncing the concept of obstetric violence for example a concept illuminated in the matrix of Bolivarian communism and whose false implant in the collective imagination has been denounced by the College Medical Organization and by this modest doctor I do it here for the simple reason ladies and gentlemen that at least in Spain this is an infamous slander Gentlemen of Podemos ladies of Podemos go to the countries whose name religion is submission and you will see there first hand what gynecological violence is starting with genital mutilation Therefore let 's focus on violence against health personnel because we find worrying data since in 2021 according to a ministry report 1.57 out of every 100 professionals suffered it There were 10,170 assaults and that most verbal assaults are not reported following the 2015 reform Let us illuminate yes with our focus the violence against health personnel because it is increasing and let us know the context in which it occurs Why did most of the assaults occur in primary care Why is 90 of the attacks occurring in the public and only 10 in the private sector Let us therefore look at the context let us improve the mediocre report of the Ministry of Health let us support the College Medical Organization which has made it possible for violence against doctors to be declared an attack on authority and denounce the lack of diligence of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health which have made Instruction 1/2017 undeveloped Is there reason for the Spanish to be dissatisfied with health carelessness A lot VOX has denounced it from this rostrum when we were presented with the infumable Darias law But there is not a single one to attack the healthcare staff none at all And it 's intolerable for them to be slandered Moreover this violence against health workers has been protected here by saying that there are objective elements that justify it starting with Mr de Bildu How No no party without Aunt Joan ladies and gentlemen here in the house for example we hope that the vocation of service and devotion to the law will make the lawyers live up to the very grave moment that we live in But we do n't expect that from the health care providers no we do n't we do n't expect them to do their duty no Why Because we know for sure that they will fulfill their duty as they have done throughout the history of Spanish health and in the epidemic And what already cries out to heaven is that here all the left wing groups have said that they will not support this bill because there are objective reasons to beat the toilets That 's intolerable That is the rulers should not continue to abuse the vocation of health professionals This abuse has been reflected in the fact that all color governments have made Spanish doctors the worst paid in Europe To begin with politicians need to know what they are and for example some community president would have to know for God 's sake that looks are not students they are doctors And of course to dignify working conditions is an essential step That is the message that politicians and these General Courts must give approving at least the consideration of this initiative We will support the consideration of this bill because we believe it can minimize aggression against health personnel and we hope to be able to make amendments to the process For starters I would ask you to change the name and save us an amendment Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,18.417587,12.4586,5,"venial mr. president good afternoon ladies gentlemen today presented consideration proposal law registered people 's parliamentary group

#MaríaDeLaCabezaRuizSolás,Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party with this proposal you show that your goodness has no limits and you will forgive me but neither will your hypocrisy You intend to raise the flag of the project of an association that intended to fight against loneliness with the aim that by approving this GNP unanimously in Congress we can come to the UN and ensure that the right not to be alone is considered a universal right and that it is proclaimed that all people have the right to be related to be treated with affection to feel accompanied and that this affective relationship between the equals is free bilateral direct respectful and consented We truly share that no one should be alone that no one should feel alone and that indeed we are faced with one of the most serious problems of our time But do you know ladies and gentlemen where you are most likely not to feel alone to be treated with affection to live with one another and to have that which in such a resounding and ideological way you call a relationship between the same affective free bilateral direct respectful and consenting That place is family ladies and gentlemen There is no better place to feel accompanied loved and cared for than a family in the family there is no loneliness it is in the family where one learns to love and to be loved to care and to be cared for The family is the only place where there is unconditional love and yet the family has always been the great forgotten for you That is why I say to you ladies and gentlemen that your goodness and hypocrisy have no limits because you invent new rights to hide the evil you have done by keeping families from the centre of all your policies because you do the opposite of what you say and set qualities and feelings contrary to those that you show when you talk about fighting loneliness forgetting the family You who have endeavoured to destroy the family as the basic nucleus of society who have encouraged one person households and single parent families without thinking about their future who have normalized the affective relationships of using and throwing who call us to end our days alone who have seen birth crumbling leaving our families without a future who promote abortion so that children who grow our families are not born and euthanasia as the best solution for the terminally ill who suffer loneliness you Your Honor have told us here a real story of the loneliness that these people suffer and to which you only offer a solution You who inoculate the hatred of the man making it difficult for couples you tell women who do not need anyone to be happy that it is better to come home alone and drunk that having many children is a delay you who are going to let children without a diagnosed gender disorder mutilate their bodies making them chronically ill for their whole life and their life in the chronicle of an announced loneliness because they can never have biological children you who allow children who are illegal immigrants to separate from their families to come to our country condemning them to the worst of loneliness which is the loneliness of uprooting which cuts off the affective bonds of the place where they were raised away from their own you are the ones who now come to reassure their consciences with empty declarations of intentions who will not serve anything if you remain alone in that In Spain two million elderly people live alone and more and more are found days or even weeks after they have died without anyone missing them in the indifference of an increasingly dehumanized society No one should be forced to leave their country alone No old man should end up dying alone No child or young person should come home every day from school or college and find that there is no one to ask him how he has gone And of course no one should have to give up forming a family We all need to share our time to be heard to feel that we care about someone to know that we will never be alone and we all know we all know that there is no better cure for loneliness than the family So what is the point of proclaiming a right for every need that we are unable to satisfy Why is that effort to seek so far away what we have so close to Ladies and gentlemen we do not need free bilateral direct respectful and consensual emotional relations What we need are families families in which we feel loved and accompanied families in which parents care for their children since they come into the world and in which children care for their parents until they leave surrounded by affection and respect You foster the family you support the family Make sure that families have the resources they need to care for their children their elders their sick and I assure them that we will fight loneliness much better than with the proclamation of new rights that it would not be necessary to proclaim if we put the family where it deserves which is at the heart of all our policies Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,12.60436,15.560239,5,thank president ladies gentlemen socialist party proposal show goodness limits

#MaríaDeLaCabezaRuizSolás,Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen calm and prudence This is what we have been asked by the highest responsible for the development of the entire legal system in this country with regard to the fiasco of its law on sexual freedom This is the solution proposed by our Minister of Justice while convicted sexual aggressors and pederasts are released before their due to go out on the street to endanger once again the integrity of the women and children of this country Calm and tranquillity for all those victims who after passing through the worst experience of their lives after passing through a trial in which they relived the horror and in which they faced face to face with those who hurt them so much after finally achieving the sentence that relieves but never serves to erase the suffering will have to see how their aggressors benefit from this new law Calm and tranquillity for all women and children who already know that if one day they have the misfortune of being victims of these predators they will not even have the consolation of seeing how they rot in prison because their Government puts the interests of criminals above those of the victims What a tremendous irresponsibility of our Minister of Justice who has let his equal counterpart and his vehemently advisers get away with it What a irresponsibility to let those who have already demonstrated truly alarming legal illiteracy impose their fanaticism at any price The Minister of Justice should not have profiled she had a greater responsibility That this law was a good law was his obligation and therefore failure is fundamentally his But unfortunately there is no solution anymore even by amending the law we will not be able to go back to undoing the mischief We will no longer be able to prevent them from getting out on the streets first who knows how many sexual aggressors with the consequent suffering for their victims and with the consequent risk for women for the high degree of recidivism of these criminals And they still have the defachability to say and continue to insist that this law will protect us Ladies and gentlemen how is this law going to protect us by getting the aggressors out of jail before they do How will he protect us by reducing the penalties of the aggressors Do they not realize that what they have done with this has been to remove the gravity of these crimes that by reducing penalties they feed the social consciousness that these abject crimes are less important than they are Moreover it is not just the reviews of sentences ladies and gentlemen it is not only that the revisions that have been made and that have gone beyond the mid-centenary and I say that they have transcended because we suspect that we do not have an official count because they do not want us to know the scope of its chapter it is not only that the inventory of cuts in convictions is destined to go up because there are around four thousand prisoners of these crimes in Spain and there are hundreds of cases subject to a potential review it is not only that Madrid has four hundred and fifty cases that can be reviewed nor that at least eleven other provincial hearings have pronounced themselves in favor of applying in the reviews the most favourable criterion of convictions it is that the new convictions are also affected ladies and gentlemen it is that the courts have already begun to issue sentences relating to cases of sexual assault much lower it is that in Barcelona has been handed down a sentence for a crime consummated rape in the past six years or a sexual violation that has already been imposed a punishment of three years but that is now a punishment of three years old and that has been committed an abuse I mean if a girl says yes as she is it 's not a rape and then you get shocked when we say you 're promoting pederasty It 's just that it 's very serious ladies and gentlemen It is very serious and it is not the fault of the judges or the defence lawyers it is your fault of those who presented this law and of all those who supported it This is the harsh reality It is not an invention of this Member or of this parliamentary group it is our Criminal Code that indicates that those criminal laws that favour the defendant will have retroactive effect it is our Constitution that guarantees the irretroactivity of non-proportional or restrictive provisions of individual rights It is in the drawer that if a convicted person for the old minimum sentence can request a review of the sentence it is because if he had been tried under the current law his sentence would have been lower And it does n't matter that now we also call aggression what we used to call abuse They do n't sell it to us as an advance if in the end that means the penalties are going to be lower Let us call things by their name you have reduced the penalties of rapists That 's what they 've done Because as always you protect criminals more than your victims because it seems to you that only those who violate the law the coups the seditious the embezzlers the okupas those who illegally assault our borders and now also the rapists have human rights The only thing you have achieved with this law is that as always the offender wins and that as always it is the victims who are left unprotected So please do not say again that this law protects us because only by hardening the penalties and keeping rapists away from us and our children will they be able to protect us and that will only happen if we all stop Sánchez 's blow Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,21.927212,12.071855,5,thank president ladies gentlemen calm prudence asked highest responsible development entire legal system country regard fiasco law

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the policies implemented by a ministry and managed by your minister must be measured not by their propaganda their intentions their ideology but by their results Therefore in view of the repeated actions of Mrs Irene Montero which harm the common good her demonstrated incompetence her persistent advocacy of sexual activity by and among minors her incisive attacks on the separation of powers and the rule of law and her neglect of the lack of protection of women which implies the legislation promoted by the Ministry of Equality which benefits offenders the VOX Parliamentary Group proposes before this House the reprobation of the Minister of Equality and urges the President of the Government to cease it and abolish the unnecessary unjust Ministry of Equality which implements policies contrary to article 14 of the Constitution and costly in its structure and to allocate the entire budget to alleviate the social emergency suffered by the Spaniards This initiative is based precisely on the damage that the minister from her position and the useless department she runs is inflicting on the interests of the Spaniards a department that with the excuse of promoting false equality does precisely promote the pre-eminence of women at the cost of the male and the confrontation between them to grant more rights to one part of society at the expense of curtailing the rights of the other half All the laws of this ministry and its minister framed in a sinister ideology violate fundamental rights being the most attacked precisely that of equality before the law and that of the presumption of innocence of the man a degenerate ideology that prejudges all men by pointing them as guilty However when the courts issue sentences and imprison rapists corrupt or seditious the left uses harsh laws that facilitate the liberation of those same rapists or directly pardon the same corrupt or seditious convicted with firm sentences a total and absolute lack of respect for justice A minister who insults judges and a president of the government who intends to submit to the judiciary a clear exponent of totalitarianism Will the minister think that judges like to release sex offenders A Ministry that promotes policies to confront radical feminism abandons the real victims makes invisible the violence committed by women against their children or the psychological abuse suffered by heterosexual Uhmosexual men as well as by lesbian women and defends a multiculturalism that translates precisely into an incomprehensible tolerance towards cultures that do not respect women 's rights Since Mrs. Montero is minister according to official records more than 150 victims of domestic violence have been killed including minors at the hands of their mothers or parents a disastrous result that results in loss of human lives and sometimes deaths in life Victims of sexual offences many of them by imported herds between 2020 and 2021 have been more than 30,000 and since the entry into force in October their law of yes or yes more than half a hundred convicted sexual aggressors have benefited from the reduction of penalties and fourteen of them have been released Also the 3200 convictions handed down in 2021 for sexual offences plus those of previous years may be appealed to the courts a very serious issue for the judicial system and indignant for the victims because pre-law convictions as you know can be reviewed and reduced due to the general principle of retroactivity of the most favourable sanctions as set out in article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution and article 2.2 of the Criminal Code and judges subject to the rule of law will not fail to apply these basic principles because it would mean a retrogression in the field of human rights And it is that in order to comply with the Constitution gentlemen of the left first of all we must read it and also know how to interpret it Let 's see if it will turn out that the Spanish Constitution is also macho like the judges according to the minister the minister who wanted to put on a medal with this law as her main asset regardless of the plethora of reports that advise her that she sent them with It is that they are machoists Because for the minister everything that is not to her pleasure that contradicts her or that bothers her is machoism or violence an extremely dangerous argument Socialist gentlemen in June 2017 you reproached the Minister of Finance Montoro in this House for letting tax criminals go free Do n't you think it 's more serious than this law that you 're letting sex offenders go free Nor did the minister hear technical advice at the 8 M demonstration days before the pandemic was declared even knowing the effects the expansion and the risk of COVID which caused more than fifty thousand deaths that you did not tell us because you to some dead dig them up but to others hide them Another aberrant manifestation that we have heard from the minister 's mouth making almost apologia of pederasty is this of abro quotes All children and children of this country have the right suspensive points to acknowledge that they can love or have sexual relations with whom they please based that is on consent closure quotes They have also forbidden people to pray on the street and intend to grant more rights to animals than to people But look paraphrased Podemos who said in his day 'we must politicize pain that pain becomes proposals to change reality for let us make it and change reality that all that pain that the Ministry of Equality with its minister at the front is causing victims of sexual aggression to innocent men appointed or to indoctrinate children and deprived of their parents serves to approve this motion and that the minister ceases in her functions and that her ministry is indeed a reference to the centre This reprobation is therefore necessary because of the extraordinary gravity of the events reported and the dramatic results of their policies for Spanish society and above all for women I 'm on my way This is what Irene Montero an executive arm of Sánchez 's policies is doing with Spanish taxes more than 500 million a year There is no better service to Spain and democracy than to present this complaint in this Congress of Deputies so that today also the parliamentary groups that passed this law that does or does benefit criminals and that their voters who surely defend women see what the deputies vote

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,Thank you President Minister your labor reform reminds me of those imported parties that are far from our traditions You know why Because it 's brought over three million undefined ghost contracts Six out of ten indefinite contracts do not generate stable employment and one out of three are fixed discontinuous According to his data his Government 's until September 2022 the membership of workers with indefinite contracts amounted to just over two million workers but for that reason 5.2 million contracts had to be signed so more than three million contracts had disappeared and had disappeared without creating stable employment Therefore a cosmetic labor reform in terms of temporality and unable to conceal reality since the average duration of indefinite contracts has collapsed by 20 and is already down by 50 days But you are not satisfied with this you are lighting up an absurd and discriminatory new plan dosing off redundancies with a gender perspective This will apply to us I imagine with the same mastery as the ERTE but you are instead of helping you Mr Escriva precisely asking for help from the Minister of Equality who has not yet condemned the murder of a girl from Olivia allegedly at the hands of her mother Therefore tell us how many genres you envisage for these novel redundancies,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,24.739634,9.306896,5,thank president minister labor reform reminds imported parties far traditions know 's brought three million undefined ghost contracts six ten indefinite contracts generate stable employment one three fixed discontinuous according data government 's september 2022 membership workers indefinite contracts amounted two million workers reason 5.2 million contracts signed three million contracts disappeared disappeared without creating stable employment therefore cosmetic labor reform terms temporality unable conceal reality since average duration indefinite contracts collapsed 20 already 50 days satisfied lighting absurd discriminatory new plan dosing redundancies gender perspective apply us imagine mastery erte instead helping mr escriva precisely asking help minister equality yet condemned murder girl olivia allegedly hands mother therefore tell us many genres envisage novel redundancies

#LourdesMéndezMonasterio,Thank you very much President Very good afternoon Ladies and gentlemen it is not surprising that the left has a problem with prostitution wanting to solve this problem with four articles There are many elements to take into account in such a complicated framework largely criminal in addition to the values at stake such as freedom of course and personal dignity The Socialist Party intends to abolish prostitution and to that end in its proposal proposes a series of measures which are partial which are incomplete and some of which are clearly senseless They propose to extend the criminal type of pimping with which our group is absolutely in agreement we will even propose that penalties be increased when it comes to minors or persons with disabilities They propose to penalize what they call the rental third party We will put forward an amendment which should only be penalised when there is fraud We are very concerned about how they are going to make this transition from tolerance to prohibition when there are only over a thousand brothels on the roads throughout Spain We did n't go into any more evaluations but they have n't done the previous job They shall consider all clients or sex claimants to be criminals and liable to punishment when providing financial assistance and even if there is free consent How can it be proved that there has been a counter performance What if the reward is a trip or a bag or the lover puts an apartment in it Focus directly on legal certainty We amend that of course clients are punished when they are able to know the victim 's situation of exploitation or minority On the other hand the members of the CUP propose to legalize prostitution that is their amendment The legalization of prostitution would have many harmful effects including considering it a very good thing to trade with one 's own body But gentlemen of the UPC what is the percentage of people who are exercising prostitution on a voluntary basis What is really important and what needs to be solved is the cases of slavery that are taking place 90 of prostitution comes from trafficking that is where the focus must be Because prostitution in real life does n't look like the movie Pretty Woman None of his lordships escape the situation of many immigrants who are deceived into coming to Spain they are made to incur a debt that they will pay by prostitution and withhold their passport Or do you not know that there are brothels even with bars in the windows That is the reality and in view of that reality what you propose both the Socialist Party and the UPC in this amendment is that all people who are in an irregular situation and who are engaged in prostitution should be regularized and this is where the contradictions come in I ask you how is it possible to protect women from sexual exploitation and not to stop or control illegal immigration Is it not a contradiction to want to abolish prostitution and to propose to regularize people who are prostitution Because of course it will increase trafficking and produce an important effect called it In order to obtain papers the path is easy to engage in prostitution they seek to institutionalize that path What needs to be done is to curb trafficking by persecuting it and increasing penalties as we propose in addition to making available to these people a real social policy of training of employment integration but never regularisation which would only benefit the mafias Secondly another major contradiction of the PSOE I ask you how is it possible to penalize a man who has sex with a prostitute freely and I do not enter into evaluations and at the same time from his Government is inducing himself to have sex with minors that is when he is consenting But does the child have the capacity to consent or refuse before an adult And it was not a mere statement I encourage you to consider article 183 of the Criminal Code which reformed the law of only yes where it says The free consent of a person under the age of sixteen years will exclude criminal responsibility for crimes of sexual abuse when the perpetrator is a person close to the minor 's poreness or maturity Moreover the hypersexualization that his Government was promoting towards minors was neither casual nor innocent Right to know your own body to three four or five years in school is as Minister Montero now calls the right to corruption of minors Awakening sexual instincts in unripe ages is having tremendous effects such as addiction to pornography since the age of eight it is beginning to consume How is the increase in sexual offences at an increasingly early age explained And they do n't fix it Another great contradiction of the PSOE They propose abolishing prostitution because they say it violates women 's freedom What are we left with Do you have the right to decide on your own body as you defend or do you not have the right to decide And I do n't go into ratings In short ladies and gentlemen they have an important mental cocoa And I do not leave behind the hypocrisy they incur when they do not fight illegal immigration and trafficking when they have not condemned the barbaric exploitation in Baleares and Valencia when comrades have gone to brothels with ERE money With this law they would be criminals Ladies and gentlemen all this leads us to believe that its objective is not the abolition of prostitution or that it diminishes as it would be desirable you feed the causes and do not provide sensible and effective remedies to eradicate prostitution I raise an important issue for you if you want to reduce prostitution fight illegal immigration fight trafficking reduce the misery that has increased with your Government reduce situations at risk of poverty and very importantly ladies and gentlemen end the hypersexualisation of minors and of course stop Minister Montero As long as you do n't do all this ladies and gentlemen as long as you do n't do all this do n't tell us you want to end prostitution Thank you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,26.433468,12.973248,5,thank much president good afternoon ladies gentlemen

#LourdesMéndezMonasterio,"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the amendments that come from the Senate do not improve the text of the law because they cannot improve it because the spirit that inspires it remains intact as well as the attacks on the principles of legal certainty and proportionality and on fundamental rights in particular on the fundamental right to freedom of expression and the freedom of parents to educate their children according to their convictions remain intact In addition it even attacks private property That this law pursues equality and non-discrimination is simply a lie ladies and gentlemen It is a lie it is a farce because it is already regulated in the different areas with multiple regulations even anti-Gyptanism is regulated in the Penal Code This law is an instrument for a cultural change that they are propitiating against the reality of things and the very being of man which is impossible to achieve through reason and is imposed by force They will sanction those who disagree with official thinking be called gender ideology Agenda 2030 discard culture climate change or historical memory To this end ladies and gentlemen an agency is created the independent authority it is the ministry of truth of Orwell and a sanctioning regime of up to 500,000 euros is established It is a punitive law in many cases it imposes harsher sanctions than those of the Criminal Code and lacks the necessary objectivity in the criminalization of offences With the simple threat of imposing these sanctions it will deter anyone who wants to give a different opinion whether it be a journalist a teacher or a film director by directly attacking freedom of thought and will create a truly suffocating climate We ask ourselves several questions How is it possible that they are defending non-discrimination while passing a law like this which produces scandalous inequality Equal treatment and non-discrimination laws of the Autonomous Communities or LGTBI as they are also called have the same purpose which is not the fight against discrimination but the imposition of an anti-scientific ideology where the will or desire is the determinant of sex In a society as relativistic as this where unfortunately the total absence of certainties prevails wanting to sow doubt about one 's own sex from young is simply perverse There is a law right now in the Galician community that has passed the law on gender ideology as a subject Well all of these laws have a different sanctioning regime and very seriously violate the principle of equality They are laws which both for the matter and for the sanctioning regime should be subordinated to this national however it is this one which is envisaged as a subsidiary to those of the autonomous communities An example ladies and gentlemen a conduct of harassment of a person on grounds of sexual orientation that is not considered an offence is classified as very serious and in each of the autonomous communities there will be a different sanction In one autonomous community the penalty will be up to EUR 6000 in others it will be up to EUR 30 000 in others it will be up to EUR 40 000 in others it will be up to EUR 45 000 in others it will be up to EUR 300 000 in Catalonia it will be up to EUR 500 000 and with this law it will be EUR 500 000 Ladies and gentlemen this is an exercise in scandalous cynicism This law adds language as a cause of discrimination How do you explain that in Baleares with the Socialist president more than 3000 cellers who were during the pandemic were expelled from the call for interims because they did not present the certificate that accredits the knowledge of the Catalan language How do you explain ladies and gentlemen if this law defends that no one can be excluded from health care that palliative care can be refused throughout the national territory and only half the population can benefit How is it possible that there are crimes where people with sex are punished more How is it possible ladies and gentlemen that you are defending equality Let 's go to what this law collects which collects pearls like the following Article 4 is offensive to women They assume that in Spain being a woman is an obstacle to access to education employment health and justice ladies and gentlemen when in Spain 60 of judges are judges It is not an obstacle to access to justice when 60 of those who pass judgements are women Are you in full judgment when you affirm this However ladies and gentlemen it is not an obstacle to being a minister in some cases the only merit is that Ladies and gentlemen this law also attacks concerted schools which will not be subsidized unless they assume gender identity or expression It will be a problem on sports issues with the issue of gender identity In addition they introduce asphyxiating interventionism How is it possible that a tenant cannot rent his house to whom he considers it appropriate It is an attack on private property owned by communist regimes This is your equality law Ladies and gentlemen the totalitarian states what they want to turn into ours also come from democratic regimes and we already have evidence in recent history of Europe By attacking fundamental rights you avoid reports where this could be confirmed you did so with the law of euthanasia and you are doing so with those who have biases of unconstitutionality Do you know the way The path is the easiest with a proposal of law without any report and avoiding public information They will avoid the reports ladies and gentlemen but they cannot avoid VOX which will be those who denounce and those who remember them and those who will also appeal these laws who are violating fundamental rights That is why even if they attack the institutions by appointing the members of the Constitutional Court that suit them so that when the Spaniards send them out of the Government there will remain a Constitutional Court in line with their postulates it will not matter as long as VOX exists That is why the existence of VOX is so necessary because it is the only parliamentary group that opposes and resists the cultural battle they are waging the only one that defends the human rights that every State must recognize because they are pre-existing Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party it is not the economy it is not just the economy The left is delighted to hear it because it trusts them in their cultural change but ladies and gentlemen of the PP it is not only the economy If values are not recognized if what is true and what is good is not recognized how will the economy know how to recognize what is useful I 'm done Madam President I end up talking about equality VOX defends the equality of all Spaniards

#LourdesMéndezMonasterio,Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the aim of the law we amend is to strengthen the right to abortion considering itself to be an absolutely banal conduct the banality of taking off your own child and imposing that culture of supposed normality from very early ages without allowing dissent A right that really is a counter right because it can never be considered a right to kill a human being In the face of any doubt or problem it cancels the possibility of a child being born They eliminate three days of reflection and information on aids and alternatives and even parental support for minors That 's their freedom real state violence She 's a real savage Sanitaries who are faithful to their professional vocation must be registered on a list to defend their right to conscientious objection It 'll be the stigmatized ones We say that they must be those who are not faithful to their profession and want to practice abortions that must be registered on that list We oppose women to consider themselves chronically ill with the treatment they do about menstruation As for the surrogate gestation the proposed modification seems to us to be a hair removal They cannot argue against these practices that cosmify women and make the child a subject of commerce and only eliminate the advertising of these agencies If they were consistent they should have prevented women from enslaving themselves to be pregnant for others and an act deemed null in our country from having legal effects The regulation of abortion as a right is the last reason that measures the health of a society Respect for democratic values or not is the issue that shakes its foundations the one that determines its justice the one that makes us consider when a human society has ceased to

life of the most helpless the life of that human being as well as ours with which only the time of its development differentiates us if we do not do our best to ensure that those lives are not destroyed in the womb of their mother can you tell me what we are doing here What have we come to defend Ladies and gentlemen what have we come to defend At the same time as this debate is taking place this Congress itself is debating the value of the life of an animal to be protected Value and protection that a human being is denied for the purpose of humanizing the animal and dehumanizing the human being They do it the same day with total provocation It 's a real challenge and a bloodbath Ladies and gentlemen this extreme undermines the most elementary principle of justice And politics ladies and gentlemen must only look for what is right Following the classics I would say to you if we eliminate justice what would the state distinguish from a large band of bandits The consideration of the value of a unique and unrepeatable life from its conception is the great challenge of a civilization and in particular of our nation We 're killing ourselves destroying ourselves We 're killing ourselves ladies and gentlemen We 're killing ourselves Ladies and gentlemen many lives are at stake but democratic values are also at stake He quoted Norberto Bobbio If the rule of majority is to be regarded as a democratic mechanism it must be subject to certain necessary limits Within these limits there is no doubt the right to life which must always be recognized by the State and which it does not grant They are the basic principles of a democracy Not recognizing it thus inexorably leads us to totalitarianism The right to life of each and every one of us cannot be decided by consensus ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party It is not consensus that decides whether life has value or not it is not consensus The time limits law adopted in 2010 which introduced abortion as a right did so against the constitutional doctrine which had already ruled on the supreme value of life and that nasciturus is a constitutionally protected legal good It responded to the will of a radical feminism whose goal was to culturally modify our society prey to international organizations and to further normalize that conduct as it has been thanks to an indolent president like Rajoy and over time Constitutional doctrine the spirit of our Constitution our tradition in our culture would force the Constitutional Court to declare the Aided Law unconstitutional The consequences after twelve years of inaction are absolutely irreparable This radical feminism not only harms the unborn In the face of a drama like this women are left alone and considering a right as a good thing it will be the only way to be offered If they have the sensitivity to listen they will know the truth in all their cruelty She 's never been so unprotected According to you as motherhood enslaves you you must not protect it making it the greatest victim of this ill feminism By the way minister last week we asked you about the sentence you have sentenced abortionists for cheating on women and hiding that abortion has consequences But he did not answer me he could not answer me he was removed in his seat because in his fictitious and false account he cannot recognize that it has consequences and in this way also from the Government he deceives women Let 's go back to the law Ladies and gentlemen to animalise human beings what better instrument than indoctrination than treating children as animals They will be educated in the promotion of abortion and contraception based on so called sexual and reproductive rights legitimizing sexual liberating including paedophilia according to the statements of Minister Montero on the relevance of affective sexual relations of minors with third parties with prior consent Ladies and gentlemen abortion is the result of the exaltation of the

#LourdesMéndezMonasterio,"Ladies and gentlemen from now on in some cases it will be an honor to be considered a criminal by a government that accords and pardons terrorists and puts in jail those who are dedicated to saving lives Ladies and gentlemen something very serious is happening in this country very serious To classify as a criminal the peaceful conduct of the provided movements which consists in informing assisting comforting or praying yes praying before the abortion centers rather centres of extermination attacks seriously our rule of law and our democratic system It introduces an authoritarian conception of the criminal law of the author proper to a despotic and totalitarian government like his First it perverts the purposes of law secondly it despises the value of justice and thirdly and most importantly it violates fundamental freedoms and rights to eliminate the dissident to cancel the one who opposes his agenda and his culture of death It perverts the purposes of the law because it will condemn persons who by reacting peacefully to an unjust law such as the current abortion law in addition to its perverse effects are increased by the lack of protection of the administrations to the most vulnerable persons Any political representative who has a higher budget for abortion centres than to help pregnant women should be repugnant When a woman goes to Social Security often pressured by problems in the face of an unforeseen pregnancy all they offer is abortion the only establishment to which they derive is extermination centres That 's what should be considered a crime that 's called induced abortion and not considering people who offer consolation and humanity to women who have been destroyed after an induced abortion On the other hand this change means absolute contempt for the value of justice since instead of protecting the unborn and instead of ensuring the health of women as would be fair it favours those who profit from the elimination of human beings and risk the health of their mothers because those who want to be considered criminals who report the reality of abortion and its consequences are the centres of extermination which use deception for economic sub benefit depreciating the health of women To whom you represent is to the employer of abortion condemned in the wake of several claims by Christian lawyers for misleading advertising on their website for hiding the risks and deceiving by affirming that it is an intervention that leaves no consequences It was proven in this trial that it may have countless physical consequences or risks such as sterility mental illness or triple the risk of suicide The text we discussed is the one that the abortionist employer asked Minister Montero just the day after the publication of some photos taking a coffin of an adult from one of the centers That is why this regulation allows the centres to file complaints Therefore the complaint is not required by women who are allegedly harassed because there is not a single complaint Ladies and gentlemen do not lie there is not a single complaint It is the centers that do not want witnesses do not want those pictures of coffins that reflect death and want to work with total opacity and impunity to avoid police attestations like these In addition six thousand abortions less reduces your income by six million Thirdly this reform violates fundamental rights such as the right to freedom of expression assembly participation or religious freedom of which persons who meet near abortion centres are holders That is why we will have recourse to the Constitutional Court There is a variety of case law The right of expression cannot be restricted by any previous censorship let alone by imprisonment Different rulings of the Constitutional Court ruled that in a democratic society the urban area is not only an area of circulation but also an area of participation and that this constitutes one of the few means available to citizens to express their demands publicly They accuse such behaviour of impairing women 's freedom or privacy It is unfair to appeal to the freedom of women who are mostly pressured deceived and in an emotional state that prevents them from discerning The immense hardness of his heart makes them present abortion as a right as if it were something good to eliminate a human being But it is also very perverse because violence against women as it is happening can be exercised without any punishment You have to have a very hardened heart to send the message that the death of a child is the best choice that it is a free act to abort but that it is not the failure to do so Do n't be fooled ladies because that 's not true The only truth is that this woman when she crosses that door will let the child she carries be snatched from her bowels and that has consequences Do not deceive them ladies and gentlemen and tell them the truth before so much iniquity before so much hardness of heart only the truth that which you despise is the one that can make us all free Finally ladies and gentlemen these groups would not exist if the People 's Party had fulfilled its electoral promises of repealing the Abortion Act by repealing that wicked law or the Constitutional Court had issued a judgment as was its obligation more than eleven years ago ruling if it is faithful to the spirit of the Constitution that a unconstitutional law is being applied because it cannot be a right to eliminate a human being but must be regarded as an anti-legal act and moreover the State must protect the unborn We do not blame women we accuse you Something very serious is happening in this country ladies and gentlemen Something very serious is happening in this country when the tributes to the murderers of nearly a thousand compatriots are allowed and put in jail those who have saved more than 6,000 lives Something very serious is happening ladies and

#JoséMaríaSánchezGarcía,With the venom This GNP addresses a question of the greatest moral gravity such as that of sexual abuse in childhood and adolescence which should not we consider be the subject of political treatment in the worst sense of this term namely that which is circumstantially suitable for political parties We start from the disgust they cause and the punishment that these abusive behaviors deserve as well as from the suffering and pain of the victims but we believe that the proposing groups and the rest of the House groups will share with us that these criminal behaviors must be judged by the judges who have done so and will do so in accordance with the criminal laws In order to veto that they are not tried on the basis of the statute of limitations the applicable rules have been amended to delay the initial limitation period which has recently been done on the occasion of the processing of the Organic Act on the Comprehensive Protection of Children and Adolescents a law to which VOX objected although it voted in favour of the reform of article 132.1 third paragraph of the Criminal Code on this matter which extended the statute of limitations on the basis of the determination of die to quo from the age of thirty five years if the victim has suffered abuse when he was a minor and when he died before that age from the date of death Moreover in the legal sphere we have some difficulty because of this proposal for a law and it is this strange recourse to the Ombudsman The Ombudsman is in accordance with article 54 of the Constitution a commissioner of the General Courts for the defence of the rights recognized in the first title textually stating the precept for the purpose of which he may supervise the activity of the Administration The Catholic Church is not a public administration in Spain nor does it form part of the public organization unlike in some secular State whose democratic character cannot be doubted such as for example the Federal Republic of Germany which is so because the Fundamental Law of Bonn in force refers to the precepts of the Constitution of Weimar articles 136 to 141 establishing in 136.5 that it will be public corporations that were in the past in homage to a national tradition of signposting In addition the German constitutional jurisprudence has wanted to emphasize that this character of public law corporation of the most relevant churches or churches among others the Catholic one is due to serve general interests in education in the field of spiritual assistance in general of hospital assistance of assistance to the most needy etc. the same can be said about what is happening in the Austrian Republic The latter leads us to wonder why this initiative has no limits either in time or in space How long do you think I 'm investigating the Ombudsman Only in Spain Until the constitution of the Church And curiously intended exclusively for the Church This is a sort of law of historical memory and or democratic memory in ecclesiastical terms clearly guided by similar politically unacceptable purposes and we are not surprised that you defended it in this rostrum on behalf of the Socialist Group Mrs Calvo Poyato who is the queen of democratic and other memory laws as is known Why are abuses not investigated in the educational sphere in general not only in the Catholic confessional Because you will not deny that there have been them and unfortunately there will be them Why is it not researched in the sport field Why is it not researched in the artistic field In all of them the existence of abuse is notorious You 'll tell me not minors Minors and non-minors on the basis of what happens in each circumstance Why is the State responsible for some of these areas not investigating itself Well we do n't know You the proposing groups need to shut up about your relationship with the Catholic Church in the past which is a criminal or collaborative relationship with crime I refer to the republican governments of Largo Caballero and Negrin in which by the way Manuel de Irujo of the Basque Nationalist Party participated Finally the Catholic Church contrary to what has been said here has already commissioned a study to investigate the abuses that have been committed by clergy and religious to a law firm in Madrid We trust that this office will carry out this study and we also trust that as a result of this study the Catholic Church will fully repair to the extent possible,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,20.596876,13.799212,5,venom gnp addresses

#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,One of them is feminism which conceives of motherhood as a woman 's biological servitude and if you do n't believe me you read Simone de Beauvoir The other is radical ecology which sees the human species as the cancer of the planet and would like a reduction of the world population to minimize the carbon footprint and human impact on the biosphere The case is that cases such as that in Hungary show that it is possible to revive a country 's birth if appropriate measures are taken These measures include the promotion of support for the rural environment serious family taxation tax breaks according to the number of children measures of reconciliation between motherhood and work the encouragement of marriage and the end of feminist indoctrination in schools as well as corrupt sex education in schools,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,20.359854,16.286371,5,one feminism conceives motherhood woman 's biological servitude n't believe read simone de beauvoir radical ecology sees human species cancer planet would like reduction world population minimize carbon footprint human impact biosphere case cases hungary show possible revive country 's birth appropriate measures taken measures include promotion support rural environment serious family taxation tax breaks according number children measures reconciliation motherhood work encouragement marriage end feminist indoctrination schools well corrupt sex education schools

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Minister once again in this House the seat of national sovereignty we are again witnessing the spectacle of the hypocrisy of progressive consensus which has been written on the agendas by the left the extreme left and the compounded right Always the same Agents who have been and have been assaulted are allowed to be alerted rather than to be held responsible for violent assailants Countries that have at least a seemingly democratic and free environment are pointed out and demanded responsibilities but countries that are dictatorships of corrupt people that have ruined and persecuted their people are never pointed out and are often caught up in the tragedy of fleeing from their own nations It is pointed out or forgotten with the 'something they will have done that they were victims of terrorism instead of pointing out to those parties that have protected financed or promoted terrorists or benefited from them It is pointed out demanded and claimed in the streets and in the stands in countries where there is equality at least formal before the law and non-discrimination on the grounds of political opinion sexual orientation or religious belief and it is never pointed out to countries that trample and despise women homosexuals or political dissidents or protest against them Always always the hypocrisy of progressive consensus What we point out in this rostrum and will repeat how many times it takes is that those responsible for what we are talking about here today are precisely those who facilitate favour and encourage the so called effect those who intend to enter are given the impression that they will receive financial aid free health care and social housing and that they will also be given nationality They are rights that many millions of Spaniards do not even have guaranteed It is responsible for those in the Government of Spain or the autonomous communities who give in to the blackmail of those countries Morocco Algeria or Mauritania who in exchange for not continuing to launch avalanches at our borders or jumping demand money under the excuse that it is to better combat those avalanches when we know that in the end they end up strengthening their armed forces with which moreover they threaten our sovereignty The aim of all of them responsible for this situation is nothing other than to try to achieve by the de facto or one day by law that the borders disappear and that there are open borders so that millions of people can move with complete freedom without any control thus destabilizing social and economic many countries among others Spain through what has already been denounced as active and passive as a genuine invasion by substitution and in addition achieving small profits through a cheap labour force Let it be clear that when VOX comes to the government we will pass an alien law in which those who enter Spain illegally lose all hope that they can stay that they will be regularised or that they will be given Spanish nationality We will truly strengthen the State 's security forces and bodies with more human material and greater instructions so that they can act in defence of our borders And our foreign policy will never reward the countries that drive such illegal immigration and those that really try to control it Thank you very

#MaríaTeresaLópezÁlvarez,Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Do you know what a father who is a prison officer does before he goes to his job in prison to do his shift He kisses his kids thinking he might be the last Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Group how mediocre you have always been and continue to be with prison officials They refuse in the Senate to consider our bill to have their own statute and today they offer them as if they were doing them a favor when it comes to justice to be recognized as agents of authority By the way this was the first bill that the VOX Parliamentary Group registered in Congress in the XIII Legislature And these officials by the way today I see some of them up there in the guest gallery what an honor your presence have always been so abandoned so orphaned and neglected that today they conform to the fact that this proposal is a step towards obtaining their legitimate and just demands to get out of the bars to which they have always been subjected from the perpetual imprisonment of being released for dealing with such a hard job in which they have to endure sticks guarding detainees prisoners and prisoners hating the crime but pitying the offender for achieving the re-education and social reintegration of these criminals And all this without you complying with the General Prison Organic Law article 80 of which you are amending today because in the face of ills the lack of personnel does not allow the opening and coverage of all units and modules with the mandatory security and organizational measures and therefore they leave prison officials in the bad weather when only one official without means has to take charge on many occasions of units or modules with hundreds of prisoners and when those officials precisely belong to the collective of the General Administration of the State that suffers the most aggressions With a bit of luck that father will return home alone with some wounds or with a scaly arm after signing in the service book to give relief that there has been a new altercation with mutiny cone that there has been aggression against him or some of his companions that there has been an attempt to rape a female officer that one intern has tried to commit suicide but that there has been luck and they have managed to save him that another has burned a mattress to make it burn or that another intern has had to be transferred to the isolation module due to manifest aggressiveness That is the day to day in any prison in Spain under leaders who carry a catastrophic prison management You and when you ruled the People 's Party have dedicated themselves to building macro prisons with all kinds of luxuries for inmates while prison officials have no means do not have enough staff and therefore some of their macro prisons are 50 of their opening and do not have security The Ministry of the Interior has normalized this so much that being a civil servant is very expensive Hey being a prison officer is paid with assaults The Ministry of the Interior has normalized this situation so much that being an official already agonizes in prison institutions because they cannot continue to hide for longer the ill treatment they have been subjected to prison officials after decades because they have been in the most absolute silence and exile Humiliation of these professionals is usual because you have not avoided it on the contrary you have motivated the prison officials to have been accused discredited intimidated denigrated and denounced thanks for example to the order of internal service in which the presumption of veracity was given to the simple word of the prisoners who denounced torture when the attacks within the Talagos in prison jargon are not the exception but are the norm Now yes you have thought of throwing a half cable at them in the rattaneries of your bad consciences because explain to me if not why you do not want them to have a regime as you have explicitly acknowledged It is done by the teaching staff the research staff the health care staff the local authorities the foreign service however the officials of the penitentiary institutions no they put their efforts and their dedication to the commendable work of custody and reintegration of inmates at the expense of their physical security What do we call this I 'm telling you discrimination But Socialists the problem is not going to end with the amendment of Article 80 of the General Prison Organic Law they propose no matter how much smoke they try to sell To make them agents of authority is justice but of course it is insufficient Look I 'm not shutting things up much less when in my veins there 's the blood of a prison officer when you 've dedicated yourself to bringing terrorists closer to Basque prisons to excusing them to granting third degrees against the criteria and agreements of the treatment boards when you 've transferred to the Basque Country the powers in prison matters to finish fulfilling the objective agreed with the heirs of those assassins who are your partners in this House as a culmination of their betrayal of Spain and the victims of terrorism and when they allow tributes to those assassins of ETA For all this perhaps I should treat you today because your lack of respect for those who were killed kidnapped threatened or injured by the criminal gang ETA does not make you deserve to sit where you are nor of course the treatment of lords neither you nor your government partners nor even the heirs of ETA because you have shown no scruples nor piety nor honor and of course no loyalty to your homeland Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,22.132397,11.528906,5,thank president good afternoon ladies gentlemen

#MacarenaOlonaChoclán,With venial Mr. President A father who asks for permanent imprisonment for a criminal who has raped and murdered his daughter is not seeking revenge is asking for justice Revenge would be raping and killing the criminal 's daughter Ladies and gentlemen how many more children do we have to lose at the hands of monsters in order for you to react at once How many predators how many monsters are going to continue to allow them to take advantage of a crack in the system to rip out an innocent child or a young woman with a lifetime in front of her parents arms How many mothers how many parents are you the Legislature going to continue to sentence the life sentence that means knowing that your daughter has spent the last moments of her life raped by a recidivist killer These and not others are the questions that all of you are going to have to answer today with your vote each and every one of you because what we are discussing today in this session is the extension of the permanent prison reviewable to two concrete assumptions the murder with concealment of the body and the recidivism of the murder Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party and ladies and gentlemen of the United Nations We can today from this rostrum on behalf of the VOX Group demand a public commitment to the parents present here and to all the parents of the murdered children that they are not only going to make a paripe vote today in favour of taking this law into consideration but that they are not going to go to the fraudulent subterfuge to use their majority in the Bureau of the House to extend the deadline for the processing of amendments so that this urgent reform does not see the light I demand a public commitment This reform was introduced in 2015 alone with the absolute majority of the People 's Party And I tell you loud and clear ladies and gentlemen on behalf of VOX that it is an insufficient reform and that it has arrived very late How is it possible that since 1995 which is the date of adoption of our current Penal Code until 2015 the Penal Code will be reformed up to twenty times and you do not react before introducing an absolutely necessary penalty for these predators for these monsters With a minimum of knowledge of criminal policy it is known that they are not reinsertible that they cannot be reinserted into society as if they were not playing all

authentic monsters who stalk our children in the shadows If you do not recognise that the second murder is a failure of the system we are doomed to repeat the rulings and here you have three families who have paid with their children 's lives for not reacting in time as shown by the fact that today we are debating an extension of the 2015 reform to those two concrete assumptions Make it very clear that if the president of the government Mariano Rajoy in 2010 stated that there was no need to be afraid of a debate on life imprisonment today only VOX defends that life imprisonment for the most execrable crimes and it will be the legislative reform that we introduce in Spain when the Spaniards give us enough confidence From 2015 until March 2022 up to thirty four people have been sentenced to a reviewable prison sentence David Oubel sentenced in 2017 for murdering his two minor daughters Sergio Díaz killed his disabled grandfather Daniel Montaño murdered a seventeen month old girl Marcos Miras murdered his eleven year old son and thus up to thirty four sentenced to permanent imprisonment In 2015 all Members of this House except the People 's Party voted in favour of these monsters leaving prison once they had served the maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years and were able to enjoy prison permits much earlier as is currently possible through permanent prison after the eight year term I have come to the Journals of Sessions of this House specifically to the Journal of Sessions dated 15 January 2015 to find out what were the reasons that led them not to support a punitive measure that is absolutely necessary with a minimum non-sectarian knowledge of criminal policy Do you know what he said for example Republican Left at that time Joint Group through his spokesman Joan Tardà That there are more punishments that are harder will not protect the victims any more or better They have repeated it again in this House today Tell that to Laura Luelmo's mother the twenty six year old girl who was savagely assaulted and murdered in El Campillo by a monster only two months after she left prison where she had served a twenty year sentence for murdering an elderly woman Tell that to Alex 's mother the nine year old boy killed in Lardero by a monster only once and a half after leaving prison where he had served twenty years in prison for sexual assault murder and child abuse Of course higher penalties reduce crime If those two monsters to quote just two examples would have been in prison Laura and Alex today would be alive But if we as legislators do not see in that second murder a failure of the system I repeat that we are doomed to repeat the failures that enclose in the lives of the people we lose Left Republican the Socialist Party and today United We can qualify the reform of our criminal law that introduced permanent prison reviewable as punitive populism Tell that to the three families who are here today who are the architects of

#CarlaToscanoDeBalbín,"With the venom Today we are dealing with a more or less reasonable amendment of an infamous law which is the law of sexual freedom and I say that this amendment is a reasonable means because in VOX of course we are against female genital mutilation and we are also against male genital mutilation because it exists although you believe that man is born with an invisible armor and that he cannot suffer aggression We are also against forced sterilization against forced abortion because we believe that forced abortion is a form of violence against women and children but I want to make it clear that abortion that is not forced is the worst form of violence because it ends the life of an innocent child Its own anti-gender violence shingle estimated two years ago that in Spain there are some 15,562 girls who are susceptible to genital mutilation Its mutilators come from guess where exactly from countries where genital mutilation is practiced In view of this you propose to develop protocols Is this really a matter of protocols Would n't it be better to admit once your multicleti roll does n't work Is it not time to give in to the evidence that indiscriminate immigration will be very good for you to seem supportive but causes very serious problems for the Spanish on foot That is why the amendment leaves its inconsistencies to the naked Are n't all cultures the same Are they not their customs and must they be respected Let 's see if it 's going to be that VOX was right and there are cultures that do n't respect women let 's see if the feminist today is going to be realizing this uncomfortable truth that we have to close the door in the face to people who come to Spain to attack women However what is serious is not the amendment it is a lesser evil within the great festival of infamy which is this law which with the excuse of protecting women wants to inoculate ideology by charging itself with rights They have already broken equality before the law with the law of gender violence they have broken the presumption of innocence they have already crossed that line of non-return because when the rulers undermine a fundamental right there is no turning back That 's why there are first times we can't afford because nothing is the same after them the first time you cheat the first time you steal the first time you pardon the thief lords of the PSOE the first time you cheat saying you wo n't pardon the thief but you pardon him President Sánchez is a serial liar and the Spaniards have taken many infidelities from him fortunately there is nothing left for Spanish society to sign the divorce suit and put their bags at the door But first he intends to leave us this law which is another brick in the wall of sexual apartheid suffered by men in Spain Now I ask the men who are in the Chamber to imagine for a minute that they had a consensual sexual relationship with a woman or that they did not even have a relationship with a woman and the woman denounces them His friends his acquaintances his family his coworkers his children and as the process goes on the people who know him say he will be guilty because if the woman accuses him and as the woman never lies To all this we must add that Minister Irene Montero puts a tweet where she says that he is guilty without proof Add to this that in every process you will not be able to see your children by the infamous article 94 of the Civil Code Imagine for a second that this happens to you Is n't this violence Is it not political violence is it not institutional violence against men is it not a flagrant violation of the presumption of innocence I told them that yes that of course it is because the goal is not to protect women it is to destroy men that is the white man because after the law of gender violence this is the most racist homophobic and sexist law there is This law criminalizes a race the white one it protects a sex the woman and it only protects a sexual orientation the hetero All this misconception about a measure of unproven consent whose only purpose is for the white man to fall Ladies and gentlemen the end will never justify the means A woman 's word is worth nothing more than that of a man because she is a woman and a woman 's rights are worth nothing more than a man 's rights because she is a woman There are personal dramas situations of sexual violence that we must combat but neither violence is fought with injustices nor the woman is defended by attacking the man nor is she defended by propaganda that the man is aggressive per se nor are you anyone to get into anyone 's bed nor do you have to tell us how we have to copulate nor does Mrs Montero have to tell us Men and women are equal in dignity and any law or ideology that violates this principle is a rotten law and ideology VOX will always be with anyone who is a victim of sexual violence we do n't care if she is a woman or a man a child or a girl and we will work for fair laws that do n't criminalize half the country We want laws that advocate for the toughening of penalties so that sexual aggressors are in jail and not on the street laws that keep away from our borders our neighborhoods and our streets to those who come here to assault women not respecting our sexual freedom As Emile Zola said the truth is on its way and nothing will stop it More and more Spaniards are fed up with the consequences of their gender laws more and more women are sick of going insecure on the street because of the herd rapes that cannot be talked about more and more women are sick of their feminism that oppresses us and speaks on our behalf more and more women are sick of hell that pass through their men and more and more men are sick of the insecurity that women suffer and tired of being always suspected of being men More and more Spaniards open their eyes to the truth and will take them out of power with the plethoric joy of a liberated animal Ladies and gentlemen let him report it Let him prove it The rapist to prison the protective mothers who report falsely and kidnap the children to jail the immigrants who sexually assault to their country the

#CarlaToscanoDeBalbín,"Minister you knew your law would lower the penalties you 've had many reports in your hands Be brave and say it you want criminals on the street you want rape victims or child abuse victims to be afraid because fear is what your ideology and ministry nourishes It is 7 million euros to promote LGTBI and trans laws to give privileges to people according to who they sleep with financial impose corruption of minors to advertise the self perception of sex passing through the arch of triumph biological reality and to promote irreversible mutilation All this reinforced by the law of equality which with the excuse of avoiding discrimination does what it does is to cut the freedoms in a flagrant way to the Spaniards Special mention deserves his propaganda in favor of abortion to legitimize as a right what is nothing more than murder and promote it like trans law in minors without parental consent Not to mention expenses as scandalous as 1 250 000 euros in a campaign to be obese and go unwaxed 17,000 euros in a report on the benefits of excusing women prisoners what love and vice you have with letting go of criminals 2 million euros for the campaign of The Soft Man and 18,000 euros in studies to know if women have more orgasms with their partner or masturbating In addition to spending money on things that are intimate aspects of our lives you are a sexual obsession In short Mrs Montero your ministry 's budgets are aimed at violating fundamental rights and inventing false rights criminalizing men and giving priority to women gay and transgender treating them as if they were disabled They are budgets that abandon abused or abused women and children when the criminal is a woman they are budgets to corrupt children in schools promote pederasty and the sex of minors All this is what promotes gender ideology and its ministry If I had a minimum of shame a minimum of sense of honor he will resign but since you do not leave the table resign the Spaniards have to pay in our meats in our children and in our pockets all their traumas You are the minister who has done the most harm to women because fighting for women is not talking in Asturian not dressing in purple not giving us quotas as if we were incapable To fight for children is not to leave them orphaned by a living father for the mere denunciation of a woman nor to pervert them with sexual content nor to abandon them when abused prostituted or abducted by the mother Fighting for children is not silence when a girl is murdered by her mother nor defending that children can have consensual sex with whomever they want as you have defended not once but twice History will judge you Minister but in the meantime we tell you that you are incapacitated and delegitimized to be a minister and to exercise no political office In addition these €592 million are intended to incite hatred against anyone who disagrees with you whether innocent men judges or VOX There you have stuck in your bones your ministry of hatred is a danger to our fundamental rights These are the budgets of totalitarianism ruin and hatred The most harmful because they break families destroy lives corrupt

#CarlaToscanoDeBalbín,With the venom Chesterton claimed that one day a sword would have to be raised to say that the grass is green That day has come with this trans law that we are dealing with today a law that forces us to turn our backs on reality and will penalize those who refuse to do so This law whose contents must be remembered that they are already in autonomous laws promulgated by the People 's Party for example in the law of the Community of Madrid imposes a single vision of the world that of gender ideology a vision without any scientific backing for which sexual identity is a subjective experience independent of biological sex They put of course their favorite ghost the concept of gender as a social construct and therefore modifying the will and subordinated to the wishes of the individual It is a foolish proposal but I understand that tempting remembers that you will be as gods of Genesis because it puts in our hands a reality that we believed to be immutable and creates with it a false illusion of freedom But true freedom is not built from behind to reality but by looking at it face to face Freedom is built with truth and the truth is that you want to build a world based on desires and self perceptions completely away from reality They miserably use the tragedy of intersex people of people who do not identify with their biological sex of adolescents who suffer from gender dysphoria to pass the trans apisonadora and impose it on society The cases of these people are tragic and what we must do is support them and accompany them Our society is able to offer respect and protection to intersex people transsexual people and adolescents with gender dysphoria but this support cannot be from an ideological perspective it has to be from a medical scientific and above all truly human perspective This minimum number of cases does not justify what this law seeks The truth is that this law seeks to promote transsexuality under the pretext of avoiding discrimination To encourage her for what Would n't it be wiser to promote a family model open to life given the demographic winter we are experiencing in Spain But no your social engineering work needs broken children and adults no identity because they want us slaves This law includes studies surveys a council of participation of LGBTI people campaigns badges to companies for the promotion of transsexuality measures of positive discrimination at work What does this have to do with avoiding discrimination By the way it is already penalized in our legal system and in addition all LGBT people in Spain have the same rights as the rest as it has to be It 's not about avoiding discrimination it 's about getting degenerate ideology into our veins and creating privileges Privileges go to the extreme that if a trans person denounces someone because they feel discriminated against the burden of proof is reversed and it will be the person who will have to prove it is not well known how that does not discriminate Within this wild promotion we come to the most intolerable point of this law children Minister of Equality you as a good totalitarian want to educate our children sexually You have spoken in favour of the corruption of minors you have spoken in favour of sex between minors and that of minors with adults If it was n't true he could have retracted had many days to do so and did n't want to What you 've done has been to blame the far right He missed Franco and Putin But even by obviating these scandalous statements which in a normal country would have made him resign the Spaniards are not willing to sexually adopt our children He 's going to meet many Spaniards full of legitimate concern like that overwhelming majority of parents we want our children madly regardless of ideology You are no one to question it Mrs Montero nor to presume otherwise because those parents are concerned that our children are engaged in a war against their own bodies for life and without going back and because we are concerned that they are sterile adults and chronic drugs Mrs. Montero we do n't want them to experiment with their bodies we do n't want them to talk about masturbation we do n't want them to doubt if they 're boys and girls we do n't want them to educate them differently from our beliefs To say this is not to be retrograde or fascist or ancient it is to love our children and to ensure their purity and innocence Here we come to the bloodiest point of the law the change of sex of children for registered purposes A change of sex that will be possible since the age of twelve and in solitary at sixteen counting we are told with the maturity and stability of the minor as if maturity stability and lesser were not an oxymoron These children who suffer from gender dysphoria are usually male about 0.015 and are usually male because in many cases during pregnancy when they were in their mother 's womb they had a testosterone

#CarlaToscanoDeBalbín,What is happening now is that based on propaganda and laws like this there is more and more dysphoria in adolescents and girls In the United Kingdom the number has increased by 4400 over the last ten years and in Sweden by 1500 Let 's be serious dysphoria does n't multiply because it does This is not a physiological dysphoria it is a cultural dysphoria because they are children with problems who end up being victims of their indoctrination The registrar change is only the first case before social change hormonal change and then surgical change or in other words irreversible mutilation It should not be forgotten that this chain of brutal changes begins with a self diagnosis I do n't want to trivialize but for you to understand the example it 's as if a person goes to a psychiatrist self defining as a schizophrenic and the psychiatrist is obliged to treat him and medicate him as a schizophrenic The State cannot prevail over parents and force them to unprotect their children in a vital phase of change and particular vulnerability The State cannot handcuff parents to the decisions of their minor children when they are not mature enough Gentlemen of the Government get your dirty hands off our children By the way Mrs. Montero a lot of trans law a lot of self perception a lot of everyone all and everything that we all seem Asturian but when you were pregnant with your daughter she announced to the world that she was a child Why For his genitals And with regard to adults to legislate according to desires or self perceptions degenerates into legal frauds and ridiculous absurd and even dangerous situations Let 's see men who will have access to women 's privacy spaces like bathrooms showers and women wo n't be able to do anything to avoid it We will see men fraudulently using this law to compete in sports with physical advantages over women with the prejudices and injustices that this will cause in sport Also following absurdity why do we focus only on self perception of sex If what matters is how everyone feels why do we not legislate on self perception of age nationality marital status or employment status Can you imagine a world where everyone is forced to treat us like we feel Posts to legislate on self perceptions and unrealities why only about sex This law discriminates against people who may feel like a platypus or Lady Gaga But VOX as always does not hurt us to reaffirm our commitment to common sense to the family to children and above all to the truth in spite of whoever weighs it no matter how much it criminalizes us and distorts our discourse They may tear down one or two generations of Spaniards perhaps their poison will spread more but be clear that they will have us face up to defending first of all the right of parents to educate their children according to their convictions and defending the sovereign and heroic role of the family in front of the State Ladies and gentlemen today is the day of shouting grass is green boys have penis and girls vagina sex is binary biology is real gender ideology is cancer This is the most totalitarian and destructive government of our democracy and VOX is

ideology But the bloodiest part of this law is children and ensuring the protection of children means helping parents to protect and guide them They want 12 year olds who are not mature enough to drive or vote who need permission from their parents to go on a zoo tour with the school to decide on their bodies to abort and to get hormone and mutilate With this law they are limiting parental parental authority in circumstances where children need them more than ever Instead of helping parents they are eliminating them from the equation as if the family were not the most important shelter for a child Cases of dysphoria i.e. of children who reject their bodies and seek a different physical and sexual aesthetics have always been very few and most children Now apparently there is more and more for one reason for the trans propaganda of governments like this which indoctrines them with talks which are 1 in schools and on social networks To that there follows an infamous pressure on adults which makes them believe that the only solution to their problems is to be trans I give the example of Primary Care in Catalonia where the hormone is prescribed for 87 of the cases during the first visit Ladies and gentlemen a child who rejects his body is a child who suffers is a child without self esteem who feels unhappy who in many cases has family problems who has suffered abuse bullying anorexia and therefore rejects his body not his sexual identity What this child needs is to be heard and cared for he needs a full multidisciplinary medical diagnosis which includes a physical and psychological assessment to study his emotional problems which are most of the time the origin of dysphoria There is already experience of what this dysphoria caused by indoctrination or fashions means for children and families In the United States in just four years from 2017 to 2021 cases of false dysphoria nearly tripled from 15,000 cases to 42,000 and nearly 5,000 adolescents took puberty blockers The problem is that you minister propose to teenagers a path without return when they are simply under the influence of fashions or having a teen with problems The repentance of these children or the chronic health and psychological problems that drag any trans person are uncomfortable realities that you do n't want to hear and that 's why you accuse us of transphobia Despite having been warned by many health professionals and medical institutions that the child has no capacity to understand the consequences of his or her decision in the short and long term less the legal ones and that the law puts the physical and mental health of the children at risk you have not listened to anyone even forcing psychologists and doctors to accept a child 's self diagnosis as if a doctor had to diet an anorexic girl because she feels fat 1 Words withdrawn by the Presidency in accordance with Rule 104.3 of the Rules of Procedure of the House Remove the blindfold in this case remove the blue pink and white flag and go to the real causes of the problem which there are many lives at stake But the dramatic reality is that you Mrs. Montero children care about a curse That 's why he ignores them when they are kidnapped abused even murdered by a woman so he promotes as a right to put children in his mother 's womb and that 's why this law seeks to indoctrinate them and push them into transsexuality You only care about children as necessary pawns in your social engineering project That is why it needs 2 to encourage them to have sex and destroy their identity and sexuality separating them from their family and their parents values They want an alienated society based on unicorns but reality is silly ladies and gentlemen and let 's not say biology As much as they manipulate language by many unscientific laws they enact grass remains green boys have penis and vagina girls The People 's Party by the way will have to look at its bipolarity by criticizing and rejecting this law today when in the Community of Madrid they enacted and maintain a similar law When you do n't have convictions you get these inconsistencies Only with consistency and truth can we help people who suffer and who do not feel identified with their body Know one thing we love these people more because we do n't care who they sleep with or what they feel We believe in the dignity of all people especially those who deserve support and help because they suffer We want them more because we reject any paternalism and condescension as this law does to give privileges in the workplace and other areas to people because they are homosexual or trans as if they were inferior We want them more because we consider them the same But as much as you work to destroy the person the family and our society we will rebuild it Because the truth is still there the truth is an incredibly resistant plant that grows in the dark and hangs through any hole As long as that seed of truth is there it cannot be expelled from Parliament even if it causes scandal as long as that seed remains in our lives and in our families and as long as there is someone who defends it and that someone is VOX We are the only ones who fight for the truth for the equality and dignity of all and we will give this battle not against anyone but for us for you for our children and also for

#JuanJoséAizcorbeTorra,Thank you very much Mr President Ladies and gentlemen seventy articles six titles more than a dozen additional provisions five transitional provisions one derogation six final provisions form the draft employment law that we have been discussing these days where the bad arts of the left have shown themselves radiant and bare ready to do anything to achieve their ends by justifying any means Employment Act in line with the rest of the rules that are also passed in these dark days in concert with the new dogmas of the left and their companions left that lost the blush a long time ago and now shows one of the darkest faces Go ahead that socialism already at its birth turned the legitimate and just defense of the workers against the abuse and exploitation of man by man after a materialistic exegesis of life through the creed of the class struggle and slipped into the cultivation of hatred and confrontation which is where it constantly squanders abandoning now the struggle for equality for the struggle of so called gender policies among other injurers We are faced with a law of employment at all only technical or harmless born on the left in its most current version where it is reinvented faithful to its false mystique to continue its work of erosion of freedoms our ways of life and the traditional Western culture yes the famous battle that really interests the battle of ideas Therefore by investigating in the law created by the PSOE with the order and command of Podemos we guess that together with logical measures in a manner of pleasant balsams such as declaring the interprofessional minimum wage unfettered a question that was certainly already being rolled it injects into the text the real reason that moves them after the canvas of complying with the European Union and praise committed to component 23 which is the manic gender perspective obsession that occupies the entire legislative acquis An Employment Act converted into a tragic farce that introduces particular and territorial interests which in no way prioritizes the search aid permanence and location of decent employment as well as preventing the facilitation of conditions of fair and unhindered working environments It is a rule that expressly eliminates from its purposes the search for employment forgetting it in order to embrace obsessively the treatment and priority of the gender perspective that permeates in a cross-sectional way all its policies exposition of reasons dixit ending with any glimpse of seriousness impartiality and common sense which affects in a rage way mainly the middle and most humble classes a rule that modifies SEPE as an autonomous agency to make it a state employment agency and that the real intention of this law is not employment but the mismanagement of unemployment It is a law that introduces the intervention of the Labour Inspectorate at Bildu 's will now that they are neither by reporting on collective redundancies breaking the commitment of the Minister of Labour at the social dialogue table Following the style and style of the President of the Government any word given serves no purpose There is no doubt that the mechanisms proposed to facilitate employment suffer from a clear lack of preconditions for generating employment in Spain current leaders of unemployment throughout the OECD especially youth unemployment The commercialization of the individual already in the language itself when talking about the labour market replacing the anthropological centrality of the person with the ecological that of bias that of gender or digital follows the obsessive dictates of the ILO where the origin ethnicity or gender matter more than the maternity for example term that appears only once and in the presentation of reasons without normative capacity In short it is a law like many others that are being adopted in staorgia without scruples of the left which deepens in inequalities and in its obsession to direct the person through places outside his own nature I would like to address specifically to my colleagues in the parliamentary group to the affiliates and militants of VOX to the compatriots who voted for us and to all the Spaniards who see with concern the adoption of this law among others and the suicidal drift to which the left leads us This government beats the legality as it has again become evident in its absolutist legacy by means of the power of legislative control which allows the insult directed at women and men of VOX when our parliamentarians are censured for non-existent attacks on the honour of parliamentary groups which as you know very well lack legal personality and therefore honour prying into the incompetence of the interpretation of the law Paraphrasing Jaime Balmes they have endeavored to paint VOX parliamentarians as fury outs of the flock that breathe only fire and

#JoaquínRoblesLópez,President ladies and gentlemen Minister you started with a quote from a book by Crozier that says Society is not changed by decree I completely agree but you will completely agree that your Government is constantly trying to change society by decree and not just society they are also trying to change reality to accommodate its ideological dogmas I will explain here an old theory which is the theory of the suspicion of the philosophers of the 19th because when I read the joint I have to suspect that behind the good words are hidden avious intentions as suspected Freud Marx or Nietzsche They literally say that the end of this project is to ensure an autonomous democratic and participatory university which constitutes an area of freedom cultural debate and personal development and at the same time is effective and efficient in decision making and its management but it is that we already know what this Government and its allies mean by cultural debate that it is to prevent with violent squabbles that enter the university any political approach that opposes the official ideology that pseudo religion of the progressive left woke and its identity logomaquias that permeate the entire document Thus in Article 2 you include democratic memory or the fight against climate change in Article 18 you speak of sustainable development in Article 4.3 of gender equality in all university activities in Article 44.5 you establish gender parity without regard to merit in Article 43.2 you speak of the creation of equality and diversity units in all universities in Article 46.2 you speak of gender equality etc As is already the case in its disastrous primary secondary and high school themes all its dogmas now become the official doctrine of universities feminism gender theories that turn their backs on the biological reality of sexual dimorphism climate fanaticism inclusive language globalism and relentless persecution of those who dare to disagree That 's what you call in your Orwellian neolingua the space of freedom Space of freedom yes but only for its activists and only for those who impose their ideology on the university They call cultural debate to attack any ideological antithesis through the process of encapsulating these arguments with disqualifying adjectives Thus everyone who opposes these items of the left woke becomes facha nazi homophobo macho reactionary that is an adjective discourse not a substantive discourse In this way the university which should be the intellectual training temple of the nation becomes the factory of semi-alphabet activists who properly educated and bought with scholarships that do not reward the effort and the approved because you have declared them a subjective right that is established only on the basis of economic criteria constitute a force of shock against common sense against the minimum political rationality necessary for a just social order It has been a long time since this sluggish extravagant and anti-national left has used the university to obtain through deception coercion slavery and propaganda demonizing the adversary most of all my political party taking advantage of the need and lack of preparation that young people carry after a practically secondary education and a poor baccalaureate of only two years The fundamentalist and anti-national lefts represent the official ideology of the globalist and separatist elites and have no more function in this social order that impoverishes workers that attacks families that devilizes life in the popular neighborhoods consenting to crime occupation of housing insecurity and illegal immigration than to turn school and university into an immense ideological trap aimed at young people seeing a distorted reality and accepting their ideological fallacy The globalist and anti-Spanish lefts far from the real problems of the nation prefer individuals who lack knowledge and are easily manipulated This is why they replace the history of Spain with a hysterical false and partial memory therefore instead of objective knowledge they offer students ideological content identity schemes collectivization and substitution of rational debate by swallowing into emotional and sensitive content For you it is a priority to sweeten the students to remove them from the critical and philosophical knowledge of the real to become activists who content themselves with the zoological works that the elites to whom you do the dirty work offer them in the form of a minimum income unjust scholarships that do not reward the effort established as a subjective right and therefore granted to the margin of objective criteria such as the student 's academic performance His interest is rather in having deans and rectors like his ideology that justify the slavery and violent attacks on teachers lecturers or student associations such as S'ha Finet who do not commune with his creed We have seen I acknowledge an effort to clarify the recruitment system We hope that this effort will help not to hire a person to teach in Complute for the merit of being the wife of the President of the Government This project also constitutes a new attack on national unity by disconnecting from what has to do with the problem of Spain its identity and those political programmes aimed at its survival within the framework of a terrible dialectic of States like this to which we are subjected under the heading of a false and deceptive internationalism of the university an internationalism contradictory to certain norms included here such as for example the empowerment of vernacular languages of co-official languages Are you going to talk to the French and English in Basque or in bable Of course this will have to be with the imposition of English because with these languages we cannot talk about internationalization But you have not included the approval of the titles either If the university is to be internationalised the first thing will be to have a clear rule allowing for the approval of titles In fact what is hidden under this internationalism is Spain 's submission to the globalist dictates and the loss of sovereignty and with the excuse of enhancing the co-official languages they enhance the dismemberment of the nation in taifas in feuds that limit the mobility of Spanish university students and promote the rupture of a single university district by imposing these languages on students In short under the disguise of cosmopolitanism and autonomy assumes the real project where only the elites the new feudal lords have political rights and the citizens are reduced to their status as subjects A new order where every form of dissent is persecuted demonized with its adjective and false speeches a new order of Orwellian coloration as in 1984 the book of Orwell Moreover this preliminary draft lacks rational guidance to clarify the procurement systems Nor does it clarify the funding It is true that there will now be dual funding because the autonomous communities have to be involved in financing up to 1 which by the way will mean that universities in fiscally favoured autonomous communities will also have more opportunity to devote more funding to the university which will further deepen the Spanish division as already happens in high school and high school where students and teachers in the Basque Country have more investment per year and also earn more money This deepens much more in the division of the Spaniards and goes against a single university district In addition to not clarifying this funding in that deleterious wording we have only made clear what you want to harden the requirements for the establishment of private universities which are very typical of the socialist government The same thing that happens with concerted education in the field of middle education is now transferred to the field of private universities which are the refuge of many people fleeing this indoctrination that you also want to impose at the university In changing the matter there is also no known economic memory that would allow us to know the credits for a new funding model or for the multi-annual plans that facilitate the new figures that they have created this psycho- pedagogical accompaniment vocational guidance In economic memory we do n't see how this is going to be financed if you can you 'll explain it to me later The proposal to include the Autonomous Communities in the funding will as I said widen the gap between universities and does not include the procedure for the approval of qualifications All these reasons lead us to present an amendment to the whole that is mainly based on this interest that you have contrary to your first sentence to regard society as something manipulated and designed according to the government What they have to do is let society itself create its own ways of life and survival What they have to do is to facilitate a quality university that at last there is a Spanish university among the best in the world For that they have to be the best in university and for that there has to be a single university district and a university aimed at overcoming the very serious economic problems that we are going through at promoting science critical thinking and not what we have today which is an ideological pastiche aimed at giving propaganda to a completely irrational ideology which is opposed not only to common sense but also to the opinions of the sciences themselves When you include gender theory while feminism commits a profound contradiction because both theories are incompatible and I do n't tell you they call it classic feminists You can't please everyone The university has to be the factory of knowledge it has to be oriented to the labor market and not to the promulgation of careers that they encounter with their students in unemployment but that is very well educated to serve you as a ram and political activism Nothing more Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,24.909817,10.506504,5,president ladies gentlemen minister started quote book crozier

#FranciscoJoséAlcarazMartos,Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Ladies and gentlemen this is what almost all of you want from the victims of terrorism our silence A permanent silence for the mourning of our family murdered by ETA They also want the silence of the terrorists and their accomplices when they pay tribute to the terrorists by celebrating the prize of that advanced freedom but they want the silence of those terrorists not because they humiliate the victims of terrorism they want it so that they do not complicate to all of you what they have agreed with ETA That is why I have to define that this proposal for a law is partly a fraud and not because it is set out in it that it is necessary and improveable that is why we will vote that it is because it aims to simulate by giving more protection to the victims of terrorism while the events that have taken place since 2004 and continuously by all governments show that all the laws that you have passed have been in order not to comply with them Make the law make the trap Some acting like a good cop and some acting like a bad cop But then we found out that in privacy Rajoy was telling Zapatero do what you have to do and you 're telling me Ladies and gentlemen on these same dates precisely one floor in the pamphlet of the proetara newspaper Gara said that the process was going to be very long that it would have to wear those approaches and those discharges with supposed legality and that it would be dripping Drop the drop so it does n't generate social alarm And that drip of treason and indignity has become a permanent jetty when you have approached five terrorists every week Five for each of the votes of the representatives of the etarra party that we have here Some of you will support this law so that the agreements adopted in the negotiation with ETA do not cause you any problems of social alarm and can carry it out others however do not conceal it and directly say they will vote against it It 's normal they 've never been closer to the victims Some are picking nuts are n't they gentlemen of the PNV and others even sharing walks with terrorist Otegi And during all these years with the various laws that have been passed to protect the victims a new victim has been generated that victim is the truth The truth that only VOX only VOX has requested here in Congress and in the courts which are the minutes of negotiation with ETA We 're left alone And we are left alone because you could hardly justify if it were to come to light everything that has been negotiated Because remember the tributes that have been made have been with the majority of all governments Unwarranted imprisonment has been carried out with all Governments Do you remember Bolinaga What a disappointment we 've had many victims Unwarranted approaches have been carried out with all Governments Not persecuting terrorists to pay their debt to the State for their attack as reflected in this non-legislative proposal is something that has happened to all Governments Prison benefits to terrorists without complying with the requirement to cooperate with the justice system have been carried out with all Governments It is a disappointment as a victim and I hope ladies and gentlemen that this new law will help you to rectify the drift you have carried over all these years Ladies and gentlemen if there is a permanent tribute in this Congress that we suffer the victims of terrorism are those five representatives of a party of ages of ages like Otegi or as the newly incorporated head of ETA David Pla If you are sitting here it is because you have all consented not to apply the Party Law despite the evidence that the Civil Guard had and you have done absolutely nothing Ladies and gentlemen of the PSOE if you want to dignify the victims and do them justice you have it easy start by ceasing the unworthy and treacherous Minister Marlaska and the secretary of prisons Mr Ortiz by trading with the murderers of ETA I know you wo n't because you 're more than your partner the PSOE representative in Burgos says you have to forgive the murderers How generous and how kind you are all Right They are and do n't hesitate to trade with the sacrifice of so many victims and you know why they do it Because they 're not their loved ones they 're not their children That 's why they have n't bothered to shake hands in the pact with ETA and have stained them with blood with the blood of our loved ones None of them none of that blood was your children's otherwise you sure as hell would n't have done it Memory dignity and justice is the flag of VOX it has also been my flag as a victim and we will continue to carry it and in memory of one of the people who has fought the most for that memory dignity and justice and in his honor also for my wife Mamen Thank you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,23.363249,5.7347517,5,thank president good afternoon ladies gentlemen ladies

#RautiIsabella,Mr President Minister representatives of the Government colleagues I have listened very carefully to the report and I am speaking on a specific aspect to which you Minister have devoted about a minute and a half I would say very little I am referring to Part 5.4 on family and child rights In the written text of your report and in your speech here in this House you have dealt with the many cases of violence against women and children a growing dispute in family relations Instead speaking in this Chamber he did not mention in the written text yes the feminicides which unfortunately in 2021 were 109 they are not numbers but they are women killed often mothers It 's a war bulletin I come back to the issue of family and children 's rights on which you yourself rightly pointed out that insufficient coordination between the authorities involved reduces the possibility of guessing and preventing the consequences even fatal ones and called for a thorough reform of procedures and judicial organisation Minister you also mentioned and this is the main subject of my speech a draft law adopted at the Council of Ministers in early December which rightly enjoyed thanks to a press conference in the presence of all the Ministre and President Draghi sitting in the front row in the audience a wide press review It is precisely that bill that aims to strengthen the prevention tools also to complement what is already provided for in the code red which we have also voted on but which in the application has shown to require some adjustment Moreover there is also a vulnus a hole in the reform of the criminal trial as denounced in December by the prosecutor of Tivoli compared to what happens when the person who violates the prohibition of approaching the places of attendance of the victim stops Maybe the day after the arrest is tried for direct but is released in condition as much as harm to the victim That bill of yours with eleven articles if I am not mistaken also filled this aspect that is neither marginal nor banal Minister then we wonder whether this important regulatory framework which you approved in early December and which also improves aspects of the reform of the criminal process because it contains stringent measures to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence has been boiled down We could n't find out Where did he stop Where are we You know better than I do that this measure contains very important rules and I mention only a few greater use of the electronic bracelet immediate detention in the presence of a serious risk to women strengthening of the compulsory arrest in flagrante for those who violate the above mentioned prohibition of approach to the victim in order to prevent more effectively the risk of repeated violent conduct moreover outside the arrest in flagrante of crime the precautionary measures can be applied Mr. Minister where has this bill gone The node is you have said it and you know it but unfortunately we all know it for the cases of news that we must strengthen the compulsory arrest in flagency in order to avoid what we said that is the trial by very direct and the release easy with the release in freedom of the perpetrators of violence The questions to be asked are why did this bill not come to Parliament Why has the evidence of this emergent and dramatic phenomenon not taken place Why did n't the government want to issue a decree law instead of a bill which it notoriously postpones over time However if you have done so you must bring it to the House as soon as possible we want to discuss it analyse it and approve it We do not divide ourselves on these matters but we must avoid making press conferences that are not followed by facts because we cannot afford any vacuum normative or temporal when people 's lives are at stake every day as you yourself mentioned There is no time to waste do n't waste time You mentioned Paolo Borsellino and I would like to remind you on behalf of the Brothers of Italy Group that today Paolo Borsellino is the date of his birth It is therefore a kind of birthday honor to him and his memory Minister please you have now chosen the long way of the bill rather than the way of a decree law But make this path as short as possible take it now before anything else because it serves the daily lives of many women who are in danger Mr. Minister the

#FaggiAntonella,Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is important fundamental for our society today more than ever disoriented and prey to unspeakable and inhumane behavior the path addressed and extensively analysed by the Femicide Commission to which my heartfelt and personal thanks go on the issue of violence against women and on how to intervene both in prevention and rehabilitation of these subjects Human evolution which has led us to be excellencies in many fields has however been inversely proportional to the manifestation of the soul 's brutishness and the dissolution of ethics rather than its growth Ethics that should be the backbone of every human action from the smallest to the most complex ethics that should be parallel to the physical and mental growth of each individual The roots of brutality have been rooted in distant times Violent behaviors could cling to a still crude society they brought with them psychological constructions that were fed in cultural and urban contexts still strongly evolutionary This is certainly not an excuse because there is never an excuse for violence of any kind committed by both men and women but it can be a consideration allow me lawful for a reasoning on why this dramatic issue which does not cease to exist Today still shows the same modus operandi of violence perhaps the instruments have changed a bit besides the hands the sticks the straps the weapons to much more the violence has been somewhat refined in its cruelty violence not only physical but also verbal and psychological Sometimes it is still difficult to understand where one begins where the other ends or vice versa If the physical one there is no doubt is more visible and often mortal the psychological one is underground sometimes not even identified The continuous derogatory behavior made with a smile is an example of this even the derision masked by irony exclusion avoidance isolation from friends and family the so called constructive criticism which instead wants to be purposely destructive the rebuke of the adult like a child are the classic character distortions of these individuals which deeply mark the soul divert the path of life of those who suffer them make the individual object of such behaviors devoid of his dignity often unable to understand what is happening to him and equally frequent is the position of guilt he assumes The mechanism becomes even more perverse those who suffer abuse physical or psychological feel worthy of what they are subjected to a sense of guilt and inadequacy are the consequences such as the fear of not being understood in exposing their own discomfort their own suffering the fear of ridicule shame the fear of not finding solutions to the serious problem Brutality feeds on this Today with this motion for a resolution referring to the Commission 's report it is proposed to pursue through a difficult regulatory path the aim of making the means for fighting these violence more homogeneous and structural However it will be necessary to address this issue in two ways always looking at the medal on both sides so that it does not become an instrument to exploit but is an instrument to respect the human being in a track of lively understanding but also of necessary awareness of how complex and multifaceted this drama is One last thought It is necessary to focus a great deal on teaching those who manifest violent behaviors to admit their limits errors cruelty to teach them to be able to understand that they must be helped because doing themselves justifying themselves saying I do n't do it anymore I did n't do it on purpose or I was misunderstood is profoundly wrong This will be the real challenge to be able to expose the fragility of these men so that they can really where possible undertake a rehabilitation process interrupting the vicious and inhuman circle that feeds violence,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo

#FaggiAntonella,Mr President ladies and gentlemen years ago when I became mayor a person who is no longer there but who has been very dear to me he said to me mayor is the one who has the burden and the honor of leading a people whether small or large On these words which I will always remember I began what was an adventure which ended even in a not complete way and left me and still leaves me bitter in my mouth To be mayor as my colleagues have previously explained is to play a very important role often with little resources available with an apparatus of technical offices lacking and with political difficulties too because being mayor having a Junta and a Council does not mean because more small as a role not having political problems In fact many times it means having a context with which to relate more difficult The mayor has the resilience that we are talking about today in the PNRR which is a different resilience because it is a physical and psychological resilience to which he has to act daily for a time that has no border a mayor is not asked to participate in a Commission a Junta or a Council a mayor is available 24 hours a day on Saturday on Sunday in Ferragosto and at Christmas He is a public officer he is a health officer he must declare the state of emergency he must know how to intervene in the most extreme and most difficult conditions A mayor confronts the bureaucracy and perhaps any proposal that comes out of these classrooms should be considered very well when it concerns the mayors because they often find themselves in a position to not apply the rules that we legislate here Why Because they are extremely complicated in their application and in their reading and because the method of extension of the norm is often extremely complicated the large municipalities may have a legal office but the small municipalities which do not have it are perplexed to try to understand what is the most correct interpretation not to incur the mistake Our measures often overlap and are a further inconvenience to these mayors The mayors then have a responsibility they do not have immunity like the parliamentarians in the exercise of their mandate The mayor confronts himself daily with the error that can be there next to him with the error made in good faith with the error made to try to solve a situation in immediacy and then maybe to make the expense in the following years Of course transferring a possible responsibility to an official is a simplistic response because it often results in the cessation of all administrative activity The measure that we are going to adopt today is certainly important but let me say the word it is a niche It concerns the importance of making the second or third term the fact that the municipalities under 5.000 inhabitants may not be forced to do management control although they certainly have other paths to follow and then the question of the difference between the concept of incandidability and that of ineligibility But basically what the mayor needs the one who wants to hold this office in both a small and a large municipality is a reform it has already been widely said by my colleagues of the TUEL provided for by the bill of delegation to the Government which is substantial and fundamental because a good mayor is measured today only in terms of consent and in order to have the consent he must succeed in doing There are dozens of administrators who would like to do this but they have their hands tied to matters of money or standards The mayor seems to have a small role while instead it is the fundamental part of the whole society so many mayors together make the territories the territories make the Provinces and the Regions the Regions make Italy and so many mayors who work well and are put in a position to do the job well can give an immediate response What mayors need is a text that allows them to be truly operational When we get out of here we go to our offices some come back to their homes and some have appointments to attend On the other hand the mayor goes around his own territory he never ends up doing his own business he meets the citizen who asks him why a lamppost is not in place because a road is not fixed and today he is often in a position to answer that the money has not yet arrived that he is waiting for a norm The hope is that this measure although important will be the flywheel and the push because the other great measure the reform of the TUEL will really come to fruition with the assumption that it serves the Italians and that our mayors of whatever political color are are fundamental for the citizens because they carry out their demands in a direct way It is difficult to find who wants to run today it is another political problem but this is not the place to talk about it The other hope is that those who want to apply and want to experience this role which remains and will always remain in the heart of those who do it have the awareness not only of wearing a band but also of honoring it in the true sense of the word We can help them,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo

#FaggiAntonella,Mr President ladies and gentlemen this measure is very important It is now known my way of intervening so as always I start with a thought that is not mine because you can find it anywhere but I think it is important to quote What is family The role of the family is very important in the life of each of us because it helps us in times of difficulty accompanies us advises us helps us to make decisions corrects us rejoices with us when we are successful always hoping for the best for us The family is the first environment in which the individual is inserted and relations with the family contribute to providing many of the fundamental tools for community integration The educational project of the family requires harmony between the various members of the family itself balanced growth of their personalities and this project is often carried out in an unconscious way through the creation of a network of relationships and messages which defines the mutual expectations and identity of those who are part of it Without the family you can feel lost not alone This is the first thought I have because the role of the family is fundamental for each of us You can find this everywhere but often this description is not consistent with the present way of life Often the role of the family as we see every day has been deformed debased in some way has been reduced to a mere name the family It 's often said you 're 40 now you have to make a family After a few years the same person who created a family might say I can't do this because I keep family Over the years the support which I have well explained here as a founding part of an individual loses value to the point of becoming a burden The family is a burden the children can be a burden the grandparents the uncles the elderly become a burden everything is reduced to a purely economic situation it costs too much I can't do it I can't Therefore that fundamental concept which should belong to each one of us from the moment of birth and in the path of his life is completely disregarded This discourse is linked to the measure under discussion and to the delegation to the Government of certain objectives that are fundamental because they give the possibility in such dark and difficult times as those we are going through not to lose the meaning of this fundamental concept of family We must help the family in all areas we must support it from an economic point of view we must help parenthood help women who want to work and at the same time want to be mothers we must help families because in these modern times the very concept of family has been lost Perhaps a hundred years ago there were no mobile phones there were no iPads there was no technological connection but there was the supply chain the true sense of the family the enlarged families who helped each other the one with the most willingness helped the poorest there was a relationship indeed a network of relationships that made the family a group of large families and for years in the growth of man and society it was so With time however modernity with its challenges that we have grasped has significantly changed the way of pigs but paradoxically reversing however the founding role of the family reducing it to a problem This measure on the other hand supports it and will certainly have to be completed because it contains delegations we know that the delegation to the Government must be exercised that we must get to concrete facts and its implementation The draft law in question regulates and brings together a whole series of rules already in place helping the family the children and all the aspects that I have touched on thus giving the opportunity to resume and revive the concept of family that we have gradually seen lost There are also many daily news reports in the newspapers that tell us about families in which there are dramatic situations about families who do not arrive at the end of the month and who do terrible acts and about children living in situations of great discomfort It is also important for citizens to know that the Government is putting in place a series of measures aimed at filling what very banally must be called loneliness being alone in dealing with certain problems I hope that this is only the beginning of the reordering of what has already been done aware that surely you cannot reach everything and everyone but that it is a first step that must be oriented towards further attention to this segment of life that we carry inside often accompanied by the feeling that it is not important enough Instead the family is because we all have a small or a large family maybe ours is well and has no problems but to turn the thought to those who have great difficulties is important Let me at this moment even if it has nothing to do with it turn my thoughts it is a constant thought that I have to those who no longer have the family because they are at war War does not give discounts to anyone the family in war loses it in the worst way cruelly and leaves a void that marks Past history has taught us and we have many significant testimonies of the past but apparently man has a short memory otherwise we should not see what we see the lonely children the destroyed families and what this situation will bring us Therefore let us prepare for us but also for others for those we welcome that we will have to welcome because they no longer have the family and if we make a serious and profound reflection we know that they have not only loneliness but an immense wound that money is not enough to repay,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,12.482743,15.083306,5,mr president ladies gentlemen measure

#CasolatiMarzia,CASELATI L SP PSd Az Mr President on 25 July 2018 I spoke for the first time in this House about the ferocity of a no TAV attack on the Chiomonte shipyard It 's been four years but nothing 's changed In fact today I want to bring to your attention what happened on Saturday in San Didero A thousand protesters started from the camping of the Festival Alta Happiness in the direction of the TAV yard Among these some thirty antagonists gave rise to a guerrilla war with the Forces of Order which caused the injury of 14 agents The premeditation is evident from the clothing of the attackers the weapons used and the strategy The attack had two fronts a handful of protesters crossed the A32 motorway and forced SITAF to close the Turin Bardonecchia at the height of Avigliana in order to prevent the launch of blunt objects against the Forces of order could cause highway accidents All this of course creating a strong discomfort to the road and to the citizens of a valley that would be evoked for tourism which hosted the Olympics of Turin 2006 and which now lives a moment of economic difficulty caused also by these situations The procession at the construction site was in the program of the festival organized as known by antagonists which have little to do with the inhabitants of the Val Susa and which attracts people from all over Europe A tragedy announced despite everything some phenomenon has well thought to advertise the event on the site of the Municipality of Turin Askatasuna has always been the undisputed protagonist of the attacks on the construction site that have occurred over the years and the reports of DIGOS emphasize how the guerrilla techniques used are very similar to those seen in war zones borrowed from other territories of conflict see Kurdistan and adapted to the context of the area Mr President I 'm sorry I 'm just asking you for an extra minute given the buzz PRESIDENT The debate is All right I 'll give you one more minute but try to synthesize why they want to intervene in so many CASELATI L SP PSd Az I summarize President but the situation is serious and the noise is high Explosive orders rockets stones and handicrafts such as the potato shooter defined as a lethal weapon because it can launch long range objects at the speed of a bullet are constantly used against the agents placed on guard of the yard What do you expect to prevent certain situations What do you expect to ban the High Happiness Festival What do you expect to close the social center of Turin Askatasuna a well known den of criminals Run off the dead guy Politics and institutions must distance themselves from these criminals who using the TAV as a fetish want to attack the State and its institutions through unprecedented violence against the Forces of Order Full solidarity and closeness to me and the entire League to the wounded and the operators of the Forces of the Order which we thank for the defense of the legality and the work of the workers Enough with criminals out of history and against modernity that do nothing but damage our territory and the whole country Hard wrist certain penalties and on the

#CasolatiMarzia,CASELATI L SP PSd Az Mr President Mr Bonetti ladies and gentlemen since the beginning of the year there have been 21 cases of feminicide which perhaps could have been avoided if action had been taken in time and prevented However the victims are many more because these women were in turn wives mothers daughters and sisters It is precisely from the point of view of prevention that the resolution we are voting on here today is put forward Unfortunately the centres for the recovery of abusive men are too few not online and distributed in a non-homogeneous way on our national territory The data are alarming without psychotherapeutic help violent people tend to carry out aggressive acts more and more serious and with a very high recidivism equal to 85 percent The study of the data collected by the Milan police station from 2018 to 2021 on a case study of 381 people admonished and invited to attend the rehabilitation centers tells us that the relapse after at least an interview in a center is equal to 10 percent poor compared to that equal to 20 percent of those who have never presented themselves to the appointment The causes of violence are known socio-cultural relational psychological and behavioral factors therefore what better method to combat the phenomenon of violence if not an intervention in schools of every order and degree able to teach respect for neighbour animals and the environment around us The teaching of overcoming any type of stereotype genre race or physicality all this certainly does not replace the final vowel with an asterisk but instilling in young minds the axiom that one 's freedom ends when one invades the space and therefore freedom of one 's neighbor or family There are many cases of torturers who in their youth or childhood have been victims of violence direct or assisted Precisely for this reason the approach of the centers with the user does not identify him as suffering from pathology but as incapable of managing the social cultural relational and emotional aspects that he is experiencing helping him to overcome his taboos but at the same time assessing the actual danger all however always aimed at the full protection of the weak subjects who live next to him Important is the accreditation of the centers to ensure that the professionalism expressed is qualified and functional to the effective rehabilitation of the subject The data collected must be put online and as perorated by the report cannot and must not be protected by privacy of course by having the data subject sign a consent form It is news of yesterday that Marco Turinese suffering from pathological narcissism denounced by the family after years of abuse and angeries which had pushed the family even to flee and hide from him after a rehabilitation path at a rehabilitation center he got back on track and even if at a distance of different time he began to have normal relations with his parents and his younger brother There is still no scientific data on the real effectiveness of the recovery pathways of men who are the perpetrators of violence Nevertheless it is evident that the attendance of these centres is certainly always a help and never a damage and it is precisely for this reason that it is important to credit new centres throughout Italy and above all to network the data collected Any new information is certainly useful to analyze and frame the potential danger of an individual if shared with the competent authorities perhaps to prevent a new tragedy In conclusion I would also like to thank the rapporteurs the President all the Commissioners and the Commission 's offices on feminicide for the deepening and great commitment they have made in drafting the report I agree with those who have said before that this resolution signed by all the parliamentary groups is really a good political page today,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,17.717405,14.336668,5,caselati l sp

#CasolatiMarzia,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister we are here because Parliament felt that it was urgent for you to come and report on a further matter from which there is a clear criticism of your work Minister you are well aware that we in the League have never done and we will not give discounts to anyone when it comes to security and public order when the work of the law enforcement forces is in some way called into question The first analysis we need to do to approach the issue in a constructive and unobtrusive way is that what we all saw should not have happened Madam Minister you are called to coordinate the prefectures to organize the management of public order with foresight you are called to assess the risks of situations that can become explosive and to immediately understand how the safety of demonstrators must be protected avoiding violent fringes being able to infiltrate and work from within in order to achieve objectives that have nothing to do with peaceful social claims rightly brought to the streets Let us not allow bad management to be the tool for attacking women and men of the Forces of Order in the accomplishment of their work It is clear that in the management of the event in Turin which had also been authorized as a static garrison things did not work in the right way it was allowed that violent fringes of anarchist insurrectionalism and belonging to the social centers have infiltrated among the students It is obvious that all this has been programmed and organized over time from what emerges from the images these movements were well inserted within the event and had organized in the smallest details the methods of provocation to arrive at the clash The mobile team called to manage the public order of the event immediately understood the danger of what was happening and how it could degenerate if it had not intervened in time to contain the protesters Preventing certain phenomena from happening requires careful guidance and intelligence that needs to be structured and structured well After the well known events of Rome culminated in the violent aggression of the headquarters of the CGIL we would have expected a careful assessment of the risks of the Turin event also because in Turin we have the professionals of the clash antagonists with multiple and multi-annual experiences of attack to the Forces of the order matured mostly in Val Susa but not only Senator Fattori I can't see now anything but provocative agents Askatasuna could not miss the appointment of Piazza Arbarello never miss an opportunity to attack the institutions physically it was a situation too gluttony Of course she showed up with sticks bricks and other blunt objects that they have launched at the appropriate time to trigger the police reaction The guarantee of the security of the citizens and the management of public order are obtained with the daily work means to understand train and train the men and women of the Forces of

we have assumed the responsibility of Government as a League we have felt the duty to be at the side of the Forces of Order to guarantee them maximum dignity in the performance of their duties we have worked to strengthen their staff and to acquire new endowments that facilitate their tasks such as taser and bodycam Let us not deal with what has happened superficially please ladies and gentlemen You all know how deeply our country has been wounded by ideological clashes by partisan wars by red and black terrorism When one trivializes referring to what happened talking about demonstrations of students one forgets how the dark pages of the political opposition that resulted in terrorism and violence were written just starting from student movements Today marks the anniversary of the death of a young boy Paolo Di Nella it was February 9 1983 the last act of that horrible season of the years of lead when a young student was beaten by violent fringes armed by partisan hatred Let us be careful when we empty the contents of what happened in Turin let us be careful to criminalize the Forces of Order It only takes a little to make a spark turn into a fire We at the League are responsible be it clear If a cop is wrong he has to pay like anyone else The facts will be deepened the images will be reviewed we will have to understand in detail what happened This must be done absolutely quickly Young students and their parents who have found themselves unconsciously in a high risk situation must have answers must be able to know what mistakes and especially by whom they have been committed Minister believe me we are aware of the historical period we are going through We understand how difficult it is to ensure compliance with the rules and how difficult it is to stem violent demonstrations burning under the ashes of the restrictions and suspensions of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms due to the management of the extraordinary and unprecedented event of the pandemic Minister believe me when I tell you that for these reasons security and public order must be a priority for the government We cannot allow events like that which happened on Sunday evening in Milan 's Wall always in Turin where dozens of Senegalese celebrating the victory of the African Cup attacked a patrol car forcing it to escape One of the main problems is precisely the total lack of fear and respect for uniforms and the almost total certainty of impunity for those who care spit or attack the guardians of order Mr. Minister as a League we will be watching over your actions and we will try to direct you to the best of our ability because we are not interested in exploitations at the moment We do not want to capitalize on mistakes an easy political consensus we are in the

#BalboniAlberto,Mr President today we are all committed to reaffirming the commitment of the Senate and Parliament to combat violence against women an alarming phenomenon which despite the constant commitment of the institutions cannot be eradicated and unfortunately seems to be on the increase Nothing is more hateful than violence against women and I would add even against children who are sometimes victims of the violence they are witnessing Brothers of Italy shares the conclusions of the report under discussion with particular regard to the need to regulate on the basis of homogeneous standards to coordinate and above all to strengthen the centres for the treatment of men who are the perpetrators of violence centres which have so far been established in a spontaneous and leopard spotted manner on national territory The action of these centres is fundamental both for the prevention itself when the violence is still in the potential state but the so called spy behaviors that announce it are already manifested and to intervene when the violence is in place in order to prevent further degrees of escalation of violent acts and above all the cases of recurrence which as is well known and many colleagues have already mentioned are also very often the most serious episodes The available statistics show that the relapse in crimes against women is very high we are talking about 85 But we also know thanks to the many studies mentioned in the report that proper treatment especially if carried out on as voluntary a basis as possible can lead to the reduction of relapse by up to half i.e. up to 50 For this reason it is important that the treatment is also ensured during the execution of the sentence as required by the reform of the prison order approved under the so called red code But it is even more important that this treatment is not interrupted at the time of release as unfortunately happens too often It should therefore be stressed that the report rightly points out that it is precisely at the time of the return to freedom that the greater the risk to the victim is It is important to remember as the report does the good practice of the Milan court which has activated the sending of perpetrators of violence to specific territorial recovery programmes Another fundamental instrument also introduced with the code red is the new discipline of article 165 of the penal code which subordinates the granting of the conditional suspension of the sentence in cases of conviction for crimes of sexual violence stalking domestic violence and so on to the participation of the guilty person in specific recovery paths more reason in our opinion to enhance the centers that are responsible for this objective Many others would be the ideas for reflection offered by the report on which there is no time to dwell I would just like to stress that most of the Brothers of Italy agree with them and for this reason too we shall be voting in favour of the resolution which refers to the report However ladies and gentlemen in conclusion I should like to express some concerns about the apodittic statement that I quote on page 43 of the report it is precisely the patriarchal model within which individual acts of violence against women develop Attributing to the patriarchal model which in Italy no longer exists for decades the main or even exclusive cause of violence against women seems to me to be too reductive and risks underestimating if not ignoring other triggering factors much more current and insidious that originate more from the loss of every model of value reference induced by nihilism and relativism of this modernity than from a patriarchal culture now disappeared and outdated or worse still means focusing all the attention on the patriarchal model as if it were a scapegoat and ignoring the negative influence of traditions and religious beliefs outside Europe that assign to women a role yes anthropologically I would say almost biologically inferior and that produce these yes sexism and masculism as a necessary result It will mean something colleagues for example if 42 of the sexual violence in Italy is committed by foreigners who as is well known are only 10 of the population especially of North African origin or if 33 of the abuse in the family or even 71 percent of the crimes of induction and exploitation of prostitution are once again committed by foreigners Perhaps an additional reflection by the Commission on these figures would have been helpful in my opinion and in our opinion I conclude with a final critical remark in the report we read on page 24 that among the factors that would facilitate violent behavior there would be I quote the static and rigid vision of male and female gender identities I believe that this statement is not only unfounded but also misleading and the result of an ideological forcing which in this report is frankly untrue Respect for and enhancement of the male and female identity are in our opinion the most solid prerequisite on which the mutual acceptance of the natural differences between the two sexes is built to be understood as an opportunity for mutual enrichment through complementarity obviously on the basis of the absolute equality of rights and duties On the contrary it is from the claim of ignoring differences and making everything fluid homogeneous neutral and homologable which opens the way to the lack of respect for the other and to all forms of violence In any case even in the presence of these questionable elements which are fortunately marginal we agree entirely with the report and therefore we will vote in favour of it,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,17.699347,14.370325,5,mr

#BalboniAlberto,Madam President Madam Minister as you know very well the prison police are working in very extreme conditions Among other things today some prison police unions have called for a demonstration under the Ministry of Justice for next Wednesday April 13 to ask for measures against them Unfortunately as you know the prison police are subject to continuous assaults which no longer count and the decision to close judicial psychiatric hospitals OPG and to transfer prisoners with psychiatric problems to ordinary departments because the residences for the execution of security measures REMS are all beyond to come has aggravated the situation further Moreover the system of open cells with the so called dynamic supervision has unfortunately handed over to organised crime the control of many prisons because the staff available to supervise is insufficient in the face of prisoners who can move freely inside the prison all day long There are shortages of staff but above all the average age is increasingly advanced so many prison police officers struggle to cope with these very heavy tasks As you know Minister doctors in prisons are no longer there because health care has been transferred to ASL Many prison police officers no longer know what to do because now systematically the prisoners denounce them for torture because we have a case of torture so elastic wide and undifferentiated so it can be in everything even psychological suffering let alone in prison In such a situation you have appointed the new head of the department of the penitentiary administration DAP raising the protests of the unions but also even within the Supreme Council of the judiciary CSM because undoubtedly the profile of the new head of the DAP is more suitable for the guarantor of the prisoners than the head of the penitentiary police It is a divisive appointment unfortunately I have already mentioned this and you have answered me by inviting me to evaluate it on the ground but Minister such an appointment should be made with an ex ante judgment and not by referring to an ex post evaluation Therefore from this point of view I would ask you to know on the basis of which criteria you have made this appointment PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Justice Professor Cartabia has the right to reply to the question which has just been put for three minutes,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,20.985355,9.421775,5,madam president madam minister know well prison police working extreme conditions among things today prison police unions called demonstration ministry justice next wednesday april 13 ask measures unfortunately know prison police subject continuous assaults longer count decision close judicial psychiatric hospitals opg transfer prisoners psychiatric problems ordinary departments residences execution security measures rems beyond come aggravated situation moreover system open cells called dynamic supervision unfortunately handed organised crime control many prisons staff available supervise insufficient face prisoners move freely inside prison day long shortages staff average age increasingly advanced many prison police officers struggle cope heavy tasks know minister doctors prisons longer health care transferred asl many prison police officers longer know systematically prisoners denounce torture case torture elastic wide undifferentiated everything even psychological suffering let alone prison situation appointed new head department penitentiary administration dap raising protests unions also even within supreme council judiciary csm undoubtedly profile new head dap suitable guarantor prisoners head penitentiary police divisive appointment unfortunately already mentioned answered inviting evaluate ground minister appointment made ex ante judgment referring ex post evaluation therefore point view would ask know basis criteria made appointment president debate minister justice professor cartabia right reply question put three minutes
#BalboniAlberto,I can't say I 'm satisfied Minister I 'm sorry The reference to the opportunity to appoint the head of the DAP within the prison police force was obviously a reference de iure condensing I was interested in your opinion you did n't give it to me but I guess I take note of the appointment of Dr. Renoldi but I have never questioned the professional qualities and the curriculum However he certainly was not the only one to have these qualities Dr. Renoldi's choice as you know has provoked opposition within the MSC itself Dr Di Matteo said he was opposed to this appointment because Dr Renoldi I quote delegitized with contemptuous words people and institutions that deserved respect referring as you know to the criticisms directed by Dr Renoldi to the militant anti-mafia perched according to Dr Renoldi in the cult of martyrs Dr. Renoldi expressed opposition to Articles 41 a concerning the hard prison regime for mobsters and 4 a of the Law on penitentiary law He defined the principle of certainty of punishment as old talk show payouts and the result of obtuse justiceism in parentheses Dr. Salvatore Borsellino replied to the press that Renoldi at the DAP was the last promissory note of the State Mafia negotiation Well Madam Minister Caesar 's wife must not only be honest she must also appear above suspicion In this case I think that with this appointment you made an unnecessary divisive choice,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,19.062277,8.184125,5,can't say 'm satisfied minister 'm sorry reference opportunity appoint head dap within prison police force obviously reference de iure condensing interested opinion n't give guess take note appointment dr. renoldi never questioned professional qualities curriculum however certainly one qualities dr. renoldi's choice know provoked opposition within msc dr di matteo said opposed appointment dr renoldi quote delegitized contemptuous words people institutions deserved respect referring know criticisms directed dr renoldi militant anti-mafia perched according dr renoldi cult martyrs dr. renoldi expressed opposition articles 41 concerning hard prison regime mobsters 4 law penitentiary law defined principle certainty punishment old talk show payouts result obtuse justiceism parentheses dr. salvatore borsellino replied press renoldi dap last promissory note state mafia negotiation well madam minister caesar 's wife must honest must also appear suspicion case think appointment made unnecessary divisive choice
#AlessandriniValeria,Mr President the adoption of the report on the treatment paths for men who are perpetrators of violence in affective and gender based relations bears witness to the sense of responsibility of the members of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into Femicide and the great work that has been done by fellow Commissioners of all parties in order to arrive at a shared document that goes beyond ideological fences It is a report which analyses a serious and important issue which unfortunately involves a great many women and which is very often linked to cultural roots which deserve a more in depth analysis The work done by the Commission of which I am proud to be a member seeks to provide answers to certain aspects of the problem Violence against women is a widespread and structural social phenomenon with deep cultural roots which still permeate the relations between men and women all over the world although in some countries the phenomenon is much more serious than others for cultural and even religious regiments Unfortunately this phenomenon is also present in our country albeit to a lesser extent than in other European countries as far as feminicide is concerned If the mere statistical data tells us that the other European countries and the rest of the world excluding Oceania record percentage numbers on the feminicide superior to the Italian ones when we get out of the statistics the situation changes because the 99 victims of feminicide of 2019 have names and faces have stories that no arid statistical report can tell and even a single woman victim of feminicide is unacceptable and represents an immeasurable defeat for society because violence against women is a phenomenon that has a public dimension not exclusively private as is often lived by the victims and the authors of violence is determined and fed by the imbalance in the relations of power between women and men and for this interrogation and requires a decisive and timely response from politics I would remind you that a strong response has been and has been strongly desired by the League 's Parliamentary Group I refer to the introduction of Law No 69 of 19 July 2019 known as the Red Code It is a law for which we fought and which represents a conquest for women who are victims of violence because it does not merely tighten the sanctions but provides for the first time in Italy an obligation to transmit immediately the news of the crime to the public prosecutor in oral form followed by the written one with an acceleration of the possible adoption of measures for the protection of victims The time factor is in fact fundamental the speed of intervention can depend on the physical integrity of the woman or even her life Turning to the genesis of this report I can only welcome some of my comments and I thank the President the Members of the Commission and the rapporteurs for taking them into account and of course for all the work they have done I am pleased that a substantial part of the report has been removed from the report covering issues that should not be discussed at school because these are aspects that are completely unrelated to the context of the report itself and because the education of children is the responsibility of parents The report also deleted the paragraph expressing concerns and concerns regarding Article 6 of the Code Red Law The provision in question provides that with regard to offences of domestic and gender violence the conditional suspension of the sentence is however subject to participation in specific recovery routes in bodies or associations dealing with the prevention psychological assistance and recovery of persons sentenced for the same crimes and that the costs arising from participation in the recovery courses are borne by the sentenced person With regard to this rule there had been some criticalness determined by the possibility that the deed was without economic means This observation has been accepted in the final document and therefore those charges are borne by the sentenced person as it is right that it should be The protection and priority concern must be addressed to the victims of crime and our aim is to adopt laws that are on the side of the victims As a League we are always on the side of the victims not forgetting the perpetrators of the crimes their risk of relapse and the reeducational function of the sentence In fact all this must be accompanied by the certainty of the penalty I can say that in Italy there is violence against imported women which comes from cultural roots outside our own and we only hear about them when they come to take care of the media that is when it is too late It is undeniable that religious factors and millennial cultural traditions are the greatest obstacles to the removal of gender violence We must intervene on these situations in which women are really considered culturally as an inferior being and of which all too often we avoid talking as if it were a taboo Pretending not to see might be politically correct but it is not a solution We give voice to women to all women to invisible women who also live semi-secreted at home who go out only if accompanied and suffer forms of creeping violence including the least visible is the impossibility to choose and decide independently of one 's own

#AlessandriniValeria,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government it is my intention to share with you all a reflection on the importance that PNRR can take on in an area that I consider essential for the development of our society I am referring to education and training There are more hours spent in school than with the family it is at school that relationships are established not only of study for the children and of work for the teaching staff and not but also of friendship and sharing The school world is such a large container that inside it you find the universe not only education and work but the development of personality the growth of relationships sociality feelings and emotions and when you are a teacher you do not limit yourself to providing a service but you enter into the lives of children and families and they enter into yours with the creation of empathy and relationships The world of school has a strategic importance for the formation of tomorrow 's citizens and we must show respect consideration and sense of responsibility towards that world all too often forgotten developed by policies that are not respectful for the teaching class and for students as if it were a sector of series b. The young people and the teaching class perceive all this with a sense of discomfort because if we do not invest in a prudent way with the diligence of the good father of the family as was said making the best use of the opportunity of the PNRR we miss yet another opportunity to embark on a virtuous path And acting when it 's too late can mean not acting at all In this decree law we try to respond to what Europe asks us to do in the face of the share part of the financing of the Next generation EU equal to 24 billion that is a selection and training of the teachers that aim at the acquisition of pedagogical skills teaching and above all of the innovative didactics It is established that for the teaching profession of secondary schools of first and second degree including technical practical teachers it is necessary to undertake a university and academic course of initial training and qualification and then to make a competition in order to enter the role Access to the enabling routes is selective and the number is decided annually on the basis of the needs of teachers The course will allow the achievement of 60 university credits CFU which will allow access to the competitions at the professorship The attendance of these courses will be compulsory and in presence the latter criterion may be waived by a maximum of 20 All perfect a new world but a legislator who can be said to be so cannot ignore the imperfect world that exists today and must try to balance the legitimate expectations of new teachers with the rights that claim teachers who have allowed the school to operate in these years For example the theme of the 24 CFU was highly controversial The text fired by the Government a few weeks ago in fact did not contain any specification on what up to now is a requirement to access ordinary competitions for teachers School legislation must continue a mechanism cannot be envisaged until the day before and the next day it can be revolutionized without transitional arrangements Fortunately the senators have sheltered this Applause goes to the majority who at this time and at other times worked compactly and determined to improve a too drastic text in many respects to use euphemism On the financial cover front too the struggle was tough to cover the expenditure items of the new training mechanism with the resources of the teacher 's card seemed really indigestible and also on this aspect fortunately there was a change of pace Uncertainties remain about the cut of the chairs expected in 10,000 in the initial text now reduced on the basis of the criterion of demographic decline and turnover of 2026 Other adjustments have been approved in the Senate access for the first three cycles of the initial training course of those who are in service in the state or equal school within the limits of the reserve of the places indicated the remission to the national bargaining of the incentive the return in the beehive of the negotiation of the definition of the number of additional hours the access to the specialization on support for those who have already carried out three years in the activity We would have liked a greater consideration of the thousands of precarious people used for years in the school that could not have been enabled due to the lack of dedicated paths however it could have been expected that enabling paths for all categories of teachers could be foreseen to provide for the extension of the transitional phase in order to absorb the historical precariousness 2024 is too limited a time He should have insisted more and not bowed too much to the European Diktats The re-opening of the merit rankings of the candidates in the competitions would also have been useful Finally it is sad to think by the end of 2024 i.e. that fixed for the hypothetical absorption of the precarious ones of the access to the first open ended test may be this subordinate with DPCM to the overcoming of a pre-elective test I come from the world of school you know I am a teacher it is a professional role that has allowed me to be close to families and pupils in a climate of deep collaboration and growth especially through active listening also on the territories of all school staff managers administrative technical and auxiliary staff ATA the director of general and administrative services DSGA teachers in reflection pupils and families The school in addition to being an educational service to people represents a powerful strategic factor for the social and economic development of each country the cultural and professional formation of the new generations the true levers of our future depend on the school Along with all this the school still acts as a social elevator increasing and enhancing talents and changing destinies The education sector is the real pillar of our society the engine for our country 's socio-economic recovery at this time of great difficulties caused by the pandemic crisis and the consequences of the war in Ukraine I believe and hope that these reflections of mine also dictated by professional experience will be shared by everyone In addition in view of what many have said and last but not least by President Draghi politics in the institutional fora must respond decisively and concretely the school must return to being at the heart of every government 's commitment and we have demonstrated it these days It is necessary to have the courage to make a change of pace to invest more economic resources in the sector and to undertake compulsory training courses which do not favour inequalities but which aim exclusively to promote the professional growth of teachers All teachers need to be valued and can be valued if motivated and satisfied by their work they need a greater economic dignity precisely because of their important function and deserve respect from the moment of recruitment until they are put in place The recruitment of teachers cannot be translated into a cross quiz it is necessary to select teachers for their ability to convey love for knowledge for their ability to do innovative and inclusive teaching The real recruitment is on the ground and starts from that spirit that the teachers demonstrated with dedication and courage during the pandemic improvising platforms and new teaching methods for the love of their pupils so as not to make them lose their educational paths We are now investing in decisive policy action The renewal of the school requires a shared path listening to those who live it daily I conclude by thanking rapporteurs the members of the Commissions the Undersecretaries the Group Leaders in particular Senators Saponara and Pirovano who have followed us in this difficult and complex path from which emerged a cohesive and determined parliamentary majority to achieve common objectives for education demonstrating that sense of responsibility which I hope will be repeated in the actions of the Government that sense of responsibility which at a time of economic and social crisis of war of pandemics of uncertainty such as this in which citizens seek concrete and effective

the perpetrators of violence that we are about to vote on today places us in front of a rather delicate topic which must be addressed with the intention of being able to act on the behaviour of each one and being able to provoke a change necessary to build the cultural changes place that in the end the goal is precisely to change the culture of the entire country Male violence against women is a widespread social distress with deep cultural roots a phenomenon of a public dimension which at last in recent years is treated with transparency but which has been silenced for too long just as the victims have been It has already been said that one Istat study confirms that more than three out of ten women aged between sixteen and seventy years have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence throughout their lives In 2021 the victims of feminicide were one every three days These are figures that make us shudder if we think about the country we want to be and the emancipation that we believe we have Unfortunately even today the reluctance with which men's violence against women is punished is perceptible While it is true that the ius corrigendi exercised in the family by the husband towards his wife has come out of Italian jurisprudence we can still feel its cultural influence because unfortunately this imbalance of power between women and men has been part of our way of life for too long The role that man and woman play in society is not defined at birth as each society establishes the rules by which a man and a woman should behave The problem must therefore be tackled with intense and convincing cultural action with the help of the operators involved and their specific competences with the objective of the definitive eradication of this behaviour The pain of the victims will in fact be elaborated over time and the internal suffering will remain forever For this reason a decisive and timely response to the Government is required Data show that men who exercise violence against women tend to become increasingly aggressive and in the absence of intervention relapse into 85 of cases In order to carry out the interruption of violent behavior the centres concerned with re-education aim first of all to make men understand what are the violence and the indelible pain caused to the victims and to develop in them the skills necessary to recognize and manage those lives that generate anger and violence in order to avoid relapse and escalation It is therefore essential to focus on the treatment of men who are perpetrators of violence with targets to stop the escalation of violence already in the first spy behavior to sanction in accordance with the constitutional principle of reeducation of the condemned to reduce the high rate of recurrence among the perpetrators of violent behavior The Istanbul Convention which aims to eliminate all forms of gender based violence promotes the treatment of men who are the perpetrators of violence with a view to preventing new violence and changing violent behaviour and identifies the creation of re-education pathways as one of the key interventions of the strategy to combat domestic and gender based violence Today in Italy men who are the perpetrators of violence face different destinies depending on the geographical location of their residence In fact there are few specialised centres to which they can turn not widely distributed on the territory without accreditation and public funding that in order to exist must offer paid services The centres should instead be spread everywhere on the territory with uniform standards and be financed in such a way that they can offer services up to the goal to the perpetrators of violence and their families who voluntarily turn to them to the Quaestors and to the magistrates who send them to the centers and also to the prison structures Among the dedicated centres I would like to focus on the Italian Centre for the Promotion of Mediation CIPM that was born in Milan in 1995 and since 2018 exists also in Cagliari the Italian Centre for the Promotion of Mediation and Reparative Justice CIPM Sardinia formed by various professionalism The CIPM and the CIPM Sardegna in 2021 carried out a project together Interventions aimed at the perpetrators of gender violence and in affective relations In this regard there is also an operating toll free number H24 throughout the region but that is not enough The centres in Italy are very few The resources must be allocated with accreditation it is necessary to create proximity centres so that man at the first signs of discomfort can go to the nearest centre In conclusion Mr President it would be desirable for all the relevant legislation to be rapidly approved and to be included in a specific title of a single text dedicated to the fight against gender violence and the promotion of a society free from violence against women,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini

#SaponaraMaria,"SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister and members of the Government a few days ago I had the honour of participating in my city Parma in the award of the new titles of masters of work by the National Federation of Labour Masters The thing that struck me most during the event in addition to the variety of professionalism awarded was the illustration of the projects that the Federation itself has developed and is carrying on from primary school to maturity with the aim of promoting the inclusion of young levers in the world of work helping them in their training and professional choices These projects are modulated and differentiated according to the order and degree of school at the end of which students are asked to express their experience and expectations Precisely in one of these comments it was written that children 's dreams should be recognized and transformed into interests and passions so that constancy desire and abilities have a way of being born in the person and of feeding themselves over time until becoming a profession It has made me think a lot about the responsibility we have as legislators in stimulating and accompanying young people towards cultural and vocational training choices that really reflect their skills and aspirations a responsibility that goes hand in hand with an appropriate organization and functioning of education and training institutions at all levels and at all levels from primary to secondary school from humanistic to mathematical scientific and professional This responsibility is all the more accentuated by the fact that school and the whole education system are at a time of great change from the educational point of view and also of adapting to the needs of the work sector In this context ITS play an important role whose redefinition of the mission and organisation has been called for in implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and has been entrusted with a bill of parliamentary initiative at second reading here in the Senate and today under discussion in this House To illustrate why ITS play an important role in the context of the education system it is worth remembering that when we talk about ITS we refer to higher post graduate courses which offer highly qualified technical training to enter the world of work immediately The ITS courses in fact are carried out in collaboration with companies universities research centres and local authorities to develop new skills in technological areas considered strategic for the economic development and competitiveness of the country The ITS therefore constitute the segment of tertiary non-university training which responds to the demand of the enterprises of new and high technical and technological skills to promote the processes of innovation and represent an opportunity of absolute importance in the Italian educational landscape as an expression of a new strategy based on the connection of education training and work policies with industrial policies with the objective of supporting the interventions destined to the productive sectors with particular reference to the needs of innovation and technological transformation of small and medium sized enterprises Six of the technological areas concerned to which courses can be accessed after a pre-selection after the diploma of upper secondary education courses normally divided into four semesters which can be up to six which allow you to have an experience in internship in the company During this period of vocational training students have the opportunity to experiment directly on the ground with the skills acquired and to contribute to the development of the processes of business digitisation thanks to the knowledge and innovative dynamics proper to the superior technicians It is clear therefore that ITS courses are built through a shared and shared design by all stakeholders and not least are co-financed by the European Social Fund 's regional operational programme That of ITS is therefore an alternative path to university ones which responds to the vocation and desire of all those girls and all those boys who want to specialize in specific areas and who can transform children 's dreams into high level professionalism and become competitive adults and realized in the world of work not only at national level but also at European level and why not also at international level As legislators therefore given the importance that ITS have we have the task of ensuring that the system works and is efficient During the work of the Commission thanks to the hearings and the continuous and intense interlocations with the Regions and the associations of category we think we have done a good job and today with the approval of this Assembly we return to the House a bill enriched with new elements thanks to the contribution of the amendments and proposals also of the League Group And I would remind you that some of these proposals have been included in the rapporteur 's amendments which I thank and others accepted individually such as the one which excludes the teaching director from being chosen from among the school managers of the secondary schools of second degree members of the foundation and that representatives of the school directors of the secondary schools of second degree members of the foundation are legally involved in the scientific committee a first signed amendment by Senator Alessandrini and shared by Senators Pittoni and Saponara He regretted the failure to accept the amendment at my first signature but always shared by the Lega Group which was not accepted by the Government which provided for the participation of the employers in the ITS committee We are aware that the lack of acceptance of certain requests may give rise to some bad moods But what we have tried to ensure is that the system can be spread throughout the national territory supported by adequate professionalism and subject to a control that ensures its efficiency and guarantees the real specialization as well as the integration in the world of work of girls and boys who will choose ITS to transform their dreams of children Only to give a few numbers there are 120 ITS on the national territory related to six technological areas To give an idea most of the ITS is located in Lombardy which has 20 follow Sicily 11 Tuscany Calabria and Campania 9 Lazio 8 Emilia Romagna Piedmont and Veneto 7 Puglia and Liguria 6 Abruzzo and Sardinia 5 the Marches and Friuli Venezia Giulia 4 but only one foundation is present in Molise Umbria and Basilicata Emilia -Romagna Piedmont and Lombardy are the Regions that in addition have all ITS in all technological areas The currently active routes are 60 still in Emilia Romagna 701 members and just to give a number the total number of graduates of the completed and monitored routes is 2,290 with 1,841 employed Which means ITS is a good solution for professionalism Convinced therefore of the important function of ITS and that the bill so varied can ensure an adequate and efficient functioning the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo

#GarneroSantancheDaniela,"Mr President Minister ladies and gentlemen first of all let me say that of course Brothers of Italy clings around the family of Lorenzo because we are all parents and we understand the pain the drama Losing a child during school hours losing a child in the school work program requires each of us to examine our consciences These parents are in pain and for them there will never be an end of pain because the penalty will continue to accompany day after day the life of this family Mr Lamorgese it is clear that you have difficulty managing public order I listened carefully to your information written by your offices where there is first the description of the events But she forgot to say the most important thing you Minister were not able to divide the students those who were in the streets to manifest for a just cause such as the death of their friend their student social centers provocative infiltrated You see Minister your job should be to prevent and to ensure that students are not paying in these squares because those bloody faces fall into your work Minister Putting the Forces of Order at the mercy of all and of no one is your responsibility because you are at the top of that Ministry is the ultimate link in the chain of command It is useless that today in addition to his inability and his immobility let us feel that at the end of the day a scapegoat will find him But you will not have to find him in the Forces of Order which we defend and will always defend for their work The law enforcement is your responsibility Minister and it is your responsibility Even this time the demonstrations escaped from her hands because she could not prevent That there are social centers that there are provocateurs in every manifestation is now evident we have seen it in demonstrations against the green pass where there were families with strollers but there were also social centers and infiltrated And what 's your answer She always makes the whole grass a bundle this is no longer possible Minister if we were in other states France the United Kingdom Austria Romania too you would no longer be sitting in that chair today you would have been sent home because too many circumstances have seen you unable to play your role I would just like to remind you of the disaster you caused when on the occasion of the attack on the CGIL you failed to stop a gentleman Giuliano Castellino who was a special guard with a residence obligation and a prohibition to participate in the demonstrations Consider moreover that the same gentleman it is said from Piazza del Popolo an hour and seventeen minutes before said let 's all go to CGIL to take what is ours She said she could n't do anything because if she stopped him something worse would happen The worst could not be however because you Minister have reached the worst of the work of your Ministry I would like to remind you of the rave party that took place in August in Viterbo with 10,000 stoners coming from all over Europe She was the only one who did n't realize it and let them occupy 30 hectares for days leaving a dead person on the ground dozens of hospitalized for overdose rape And yet she was n't even able to kick them out They 're gone I would also like to remind you that since you played this important role our borders have become a colob In your mandate you were unable to defend the borders of Italy but only the borders of Europe The landings have increased and we have reached over 60,000 compared to 10,000 two years ago You ask yourself a few questions or can you just read what your offices are asking you to come to Parliament and say things that will remain in the history of this nation as when in this House to the precise question about what that bourgeois agent did when he was pushing that truck always during the attack on the CGIL you replied that you were verifying the wavy force exerted in the middle How long will we have to hear these answers in a House of Institutions Do you really think we 're blind and deaf Do you really think that if ministers in other countries had your behavior today they would still be sitting

#PillonSimone,Minister it was a pleasure to hear your report in this House In this year a good job has been done and however a big piece of road still remains to be done Minister you opened your report with a letter you wanted to read to this House it was important we appreciated it so as never to forget that justice is a very deep cord in the heart of every human being and we are called to that desire for justice each in his role and in his task to give satisfaction You have noted the need to intervene urgently in the face of the latest disturbing facts of judicial reporting which have undermined confidence in the judiciary He spoke in his report of the need to re-separate citizens confidence in the judiciary I could not agree more A reform of the Supreme Council of the judiciary is needed and we need to intervene on each of those issues that the political force I represent today has presented to the public as referenda the appeal of the PM the responsibility of the magistrates the separation of careers and the reform of the MSM Quis custodiet custodias Today it is more essential than ever that this question be asked and it is equally essential to find an answer I do not want to forget what you said about the need to intervene on prison facilities on support for men and women in the prison police I would also like to mention Minister the need to review and do so as soon as possible certain aspects of emergency legislation which restrict in some cases even severely the right to defence and to conflict I believe that we can now decide to go beyond those limits There are aspects which you have particularly enucleated concerning the reform of the family process We worked together on the reform of the family process and I believe that the work that came out of it is good interesting and with good prospects You have rightly started this issue by talking about feminicide but let me tell you Minister that feminicide is not family law but criminal law it is another thing She read a letter I would like to read more in my turn starting with that of Luigi a father of Naples who writes to me Good morning Senator I 've been facing a ten year battle against false stalking and ill treatment charges I 've been tried two times I 've both been acquitted The court had arranged a common trust but the Court of Appeal imposed exclusive custody despite having passed two technical advice for the evaluation of my parental ability If you can help me I 'd appreciate it A broken dad 23 June 2021 is replaced by the following Then there is that of Stephen a father of Nuoro who writes to me Forgive me if I address you but I have not seen my son for almost a year Is it possible that a mother with a four year old son disappears from the face of the Earth The child was taken to Belarus by his mother and although the local court ordered the return under the Hague Convention the mother opposes and nobody does anything Please help me Francesco a father of Prato writes to me Good morning Senator I 'd like to talk to you I 'm a separate dad I got a punitive sentence I just want to see my son more often but now I can only see him one day a week I 'd like to pay the right money to keep it and not a crazy maintenance I 'm gonna have to sleep in the car cause I can't have a house for rent anymore Please call me Then there is Anna a grandmother of Milan Good morning Senator I 'm a grandmother who does n't see her granddaughter she lives 500 meters from my house for months now and even my son can't be with her three year old despite the court order After months and months of unnecessary trials the money is over and my son is desperate and distrusted he no longer knows what to do and I am very worried Please Senator help us These are stories of life lived they are facts we in the face of these facts have tried with the reform of the civil process to give some response but until we intervene with a trust really shared and with a training of magistrates lawyers and other operators who are really respectful of the shared trust we will not get out of this cul de-sac Mr. Minister it is appropriate to avoid in the process of family logic of opposition between mom and dad between husband and wife it is not to be nourished the intrafamily conflict but promoted a logic of alliance not of demonization of the other otherwise it will always be the children to pay for it You said words that I feel like sharing and signing as well as with the pen even with the heart He said that justice does not feed on hatred but seeks the truth and the care of relationships Justice must be able to unite rather than divide this is all the more true in the family process which is still controversial today and cannot be a child of ideologies Please Minister I repeat feminicide is criminal law it is another thing the civil process and the family process must not be the result of mutual demonisation There are other issues Minister which concern us because they always impact on the weakest the most fragile and our children What happens in an abuse of the family process also happens in other areas We have already spoken with the letter that I read before of the international abduction of minors a plague that unfortunately does not mention stopping in Italy It is necessary to intervene and support these parents who are not always dangerous and paternalistic males or worse still patriarchal but very often they are mothers who have suffered the subtraction of their child often brought by fathers in Islamic countries We must intervene and possibly even with legal aid support the immense legal costs that must be incurred abroad Faced with all this international framework we have noted with concern the advance of a creative jurisprudence which despite the clear and precise arrests of the Supreme Court of Cassation in united sections and of the Constitutional Court with the judgment n. 33 of 2021 pushes for the indirect legitimacy of a barbaric practice unacceptable unworthy of a civilized country and contrary to any form of dignity of women I 'm talking about the uterus for rent We cannot legitimize either ex ante or worse still ex post a practice that exposes the woman to be considered less than a living incubator We cannot allow children to be bought on the Internet to be selected from the catalog according to the physical characteristics of their parent and then bought and brought to Italy underground legitimizing all later with the beautiful sentence of a court complacent We need Minister an international moratorium on the uterus for rent We need the uterus for rent to be recognised by our country as a universal offense It 's not like that today Today the conduct of those who resort to the practice of the uterus rented abroad is not punished because it does not fall among the criminal offences if committed abroad There are many other issues I would like to address A bill already passed in the Senate is being examined in the House to prevent self harm and turn self harm into a crime Today this is not the case our children and our children who are also complicit in distance learning DAD and the use of computers and devices are now exposed to attacks ranging from incitement to child pornography to incitement to self harm in short to absolute dangers for their safety We must also intervene on this We can not remain silent I conclude Minister by urging you to move forward as I said much has been done but much still needs to be done with its management however we trust that we can really improve things for the future of our children our young people and our country,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,19.199492,10.401862,5,minister pleasure hear report house year good job

#PillonSimone,"Minister starting in 2018 the Minister for the Interior Matteo Salvini had given impetus to the experimentation for the use by law enforcement of electric impulse guns the so called tasers considering them an important support for those who work every day to guarantee security and public order With great satisfaction the commitment has been maintained and the police have been equipped with electrical devices almost 5,000 tasers have been distributed throughout the national territory Unfortunately however prison police officers have not been included in the supply who suffer daily assaults from inmates inside prison facilities Already with a previous act of inspection union at the first signature of Senator Stefani the parliamentarians of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione have exposed the discomfort denounced by the prison police unions regarding the aggressions suffered by the agents in the performance of their work and by the prisoners for good It is only thanks to the high professionalism and the high sense of duty if the prison agents manage to bring the order back inside the prison structures and avoid worse consequences to people or things Prison police officers are too often victims of aggression and it is essential for their safety that they be guaranteed appropriate safeguards and instruments To date prison police officers are not expecting the Taser 's budget but it would be important to re-evaluate this decision It is therefore asked to know whether the Minister in address does not consider it appropriate to equip prison police personnel with suitable tools to defend themselves from internal aggressions to prison structures and to defend other prisoners such as electric bollards even if only and exclusively in cases where they are forced to face attacks on the person Let me add that often visiting prisons we are faced with complaints from prison police officers who claim that they simply have their hands to deal with possible aggressions The alternative is between the use of your hands and the use of lethal force consisting of the firearms supplied Perhaps an intermediate instrument which safeguards the life of the attacker in addition to that of the attackers could be useful for this purpose PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Justice Professor Cartabia has the right to reply to the question which has just been put for three minutes",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,21.204298,8.790323,5,"minister starting 2018 minister interior matteo salvini given impetus experimentation use law enforcement electric impulse guns called tasers considering important support work every day guarantee security public order great satisfaction commitment maintained police equipped electrical devices almost 5,000 tasers distributed throughout national territory unfortunately however prison police officers included supply suffer daily assaults inmates inside prison facilities already previous act inspection union first signature senator stefani parliamentarians lega salvini group premier partito sardo d'azione exposed discomfort denounced prison police unions regarding aggressions suffered agents performance work prisoners good thanks high professionalism high sense duty prison agents manage bring order back inside prison structures avoid worse consequences people things prison police officers often victims aggression essential safety guaranteed appropriate safeguards instruments date prison police officers expecting taser 's budget would important re-evaluate decision therefore asked know whether minister address consider appropriate equip prison police personnel suitable tools defend internal aggressions prison structures defend prisoners electric bollards even exclusively cases forced face attacks person let add often visiting prisons faced complaints prison police officers claim simply hands deal possible aggressions alternative use hands use lethal force consisting firearms supplied perhaps intermediate instrument safeguards life attacker addition attackers could useful purpose president debate minister justice professor cartabia right reply question put three minutes"
#PillonSimone,Minister we are pleased with your answer since we feel that your will is in the sense of starting or evaluating to start an experiment as a department weapon of course with all the limitations and security that it is necessary to guarantee precisely so that it does not become a dangerous instrument that is then turned against those who are there to protect public order We also learn with great satisfaction of the beginning of the spread of the so called bodycams which are a valuable tool for our law enforcement forces to ensure security to them and also to prisoners who are often attacked by other prisoners Thank you and I wish you well PRESIDENT The debate is The question time questions on the agenda are thus exhausted,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,21.591711,7.9226437,5,minister pleased answer since feel sense starting evaluating start experiment department weapon course limitations security necessary guarantee precisely become dangerous instrument turned protect public order also learn great satisfaction beginning spread called bodycams valuable tool law enforcement forces ensure security also prisoners often attacked prisoners thank wish well president debate question time questions agenda thus exhausted
#PirovanoDaisy,Mr President Madam Minister as we unfortunately know in Milan on New Year 's Eve at least nine young women were victims of sexual harassment and violence As we can see on the numerous videos circulating on the net and as reported by the media 18 young people 15 years old and three minors between fifteen and twenty one years old both foreign and second generation Italians of North African origin have been identified because they are considered involved in sexual assaults According to the investigators findings there would be at least three different episodes of violence that were always consumed in Milan in Piazza Duomo on New Year 's Eve These three episodes involve this group of young and very young people who seem to act in packs but above all in an organized way These images of course immediately reminded us of what happened during the 2016 New Year 's Eve in Cologne and in other German cities where hundreds of foreigners and German citizens of North African origin relented against women intent on celebrating New Year 's Eve causing real organized guerrilla actions aimed at sexual assaults We know of course that violence against women is a problem that affects all societies but attention must be paid to the pervasiveness of certain cultures that have radicalized over time a vision of women who are highly discriminatory placed in a condition of subalternity and in stark contrast to the principles of our Constitution which are based on the democratic culture that has belonged to the West for millennia It is worrying that in some Arab countries in the North African region the collective harassment of a woman is a practice that has had an exponential increase in the last twenty years following the path of religious radicalization There are areas and neighborhoods without any form of control especially in European states where there is a higher rate of immigration This may lead to the risk of an increase in phenomena such as those described and highlights the inability to predict stable integration processes It is worrying about the non-management of the phenomenon especially in the highly migratory Member States and there is a great difficulty in combating the proliferation of these groups of very young people who do not recognize the value systems of our European countries The Minister is therefore asked what measures he intends to take to counter the proliferation of phenomena of this nature,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,18.059696,15.154246,5,mr president madam minister unfortunately know milan new year 's eve least nine young women victims sexual harassment violence see numerous videos circulating net reported media 18 young people 15 years old three minors fifteen twenty one years old foreign second generation italians north african origin identified considered involved sexual assaults according investigators findings would least three different episodes violence always consumed milan piazza duomo new year 's eve three episodes involve group young young people seem act packs organized way images course immediately reminded us happened 2016 new year 's eve cologne german cities hundreds foreigners german citizens north african origin relented women intent celebrating new year 's eve causing real organized guerrilla actions aimed sexual assaults know course violence women problem affects societies attention must paid pervasiveness certain cultures radicalized time vision women highly discriminatory placed condition subalternity stark contrast principles constitution based democratic culture belonged west millennia worrying arab countries north african region collective harassment woman practice exponential increase last twenty years following path religious radicalization areas neighborhoods without form control especially european states higher rate immigration may lead risk increase phenomena described highlights inability predict stable integration processes worrying non-management phenomenon especially highly migratory member states great difficulty combating proliferation groups young people recognize value systems european countries minister therefore asked measures intends take counter proliferation phenomena nature
