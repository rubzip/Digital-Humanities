#EmilioJesúsDelValleRodríguez,"With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Foral Community of Navarre the VOX Parliamentary Group has tabled an amendment to the full return to the Government of the draft law amending Law 28/1990 of 26 December approving the Economic Convention between the State and the Foral Community of Navarre My parliamentary group has opposed its direct processing and single reading because we believe that although the Constitutional Court has endorsed the use of this special procedure for this type of legislation it is no less true that nothing prevents the use of the ordinary legislative procedure A procedure is being used to allow the plenary in a single debate to approve an initiative without having to go through the previous steps of the Commission and the Commission This fact has been unanimously criticised by the doctrine an objection which we share in its entirety in so far as it imposes a severe restriction on the legislative powers of Members and groups and results in the exercise of the legislative function of this Parliament In this sense the House 's activity is limited to a single examination and vote on the initiative taken so that the condition on the power of debate and parliamentary discussion is clear to such an extent that some authors argue that the use of this procedure makes the House a mere body of ratification or rejection restricting its own deliberative capacity Ladies and gentlemen today we are going to pass a law of which we have no more information than that derived from its own text because once again the debate has been stolen from this Parliament and any explanation has been avoided as to the technical aspects of the proposed reform its economic and social impact as well as the calculation of its contribution to the Navarra Foral Community The equations and variables to be taken into account for the calculation of the foral contribution reveal a mathematical maze of impossible understanding for ordinary citizens On June 7 2018 the newly appointed Minister of Finance Maria Jesús Montero said publicly that the issue of the Basque quota on which she had shown reluctance in the past must be transparent she said that the autonomous communities had had manifestly insufficient resources in recent years and she advocated with regard to the Basque quota and the Navarra contribution why it is clearly explained how their calculations are carried out Literally he said It has to be explained transparently how calculations are made It has never been fully explained how the services provided by the State are valued It is important that it is taken into account at this moment when we live Where is that transparency Minister Again opacity opacity and opacity It is the most opaque government in Spanish democratic history and it is not acceptable for members of the Congress of Deputies to ignore the tricks traps and some falsehoods contained in the law that we are discussing today Minister we want light where you want darkness Ladies and gentlemen for this new amendment of the economic agreement with Navarre and it is the sixth as the Minister has already said the Government is delegating new powers to the outside community in tax matters extending in various ways the assumptions that fall under its competence some as relevant as allowing the region to manage VAT on electronic commerce and so called Tobin and Google fees In doing so the Government is delving into the serious asymmetries between the common system and the foral regime which in turn involve significant inequalities between the Spanish and grant unjustified financial privileges to those subject to the foral regime In the face of this VOX proposes a State at the service of the unit of Spain in which there are no differences between regions or between Spaniards depending on the place in which they reside or work On the contrary it is necessary to strengthen links between Spaniards and ensure equality between them in order to ensure the prosperity coexistence and well being of our homeland and to achieve a modern State in which there are no eighteen different legal systems It is clear that the persistence of alleged regional historical rights covered by the first additional provision of the Constitution which translates into the existence of a peculiar fiscal regime only deepens the inequality between the Spanish It is therefore necessary to abolish legal privileges such as the one constituted by the economic agreement which in the present case involves opposing the processing of this bill which postulates its updating Ladies and gentlemen the bill is also a further sign of the inconsistency that characterizes the Spanish left In November 2017 the current Minister of Finance and Public Service Maria Jesús Montero asked the then Minister Mr Montoro when she was a Finance Advisor of the Board of Andalusia who will end the outlaw privileges and literally demanded that she Address a recalculation of the Basque quota and the Navarra contribution so that the recognition of their outlaw rights do not translate into unjustified financial privileges Obviously the Minister 's request today did not provide for the future government of her party to rest in the PNV and EH Bildu Alain Cuenca director general of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and secretary of the committee of experts for tax reform already in 2017 denounced to the Ombudsman the unconstitutionality of the system and stated literally the following The calculation of the Basque quota presents errors errors and invented data and allows the Basque Country and also Navarre to receive money from the rest of Spain Ladies and gentlemen Article 31 of the Spanish Constitution stipulates that all Spaniards shall contribute to the maintenance of public expenditure in accordance with their economic capacity through a fair tax system inspired by the principles of equality and progressive This equality must be interpreted in accordance with article 14 which states Spanish are equal before the law without discrimination on grounds of nationality race sex religion opinion or any other personal or social condition or circumstance Also in line with article 139 according to which All Spaniards have the same rights and obligations in any part of the territory of the State Together with the principle of equality between all Spaniards the principle of interterritorial solidarity set out in article 138 of the Constitution requires the State to ensure 'an adequate and fair economic balance between the various parts of the Spanish territory which implies that the differences between the statutes of the different autonomous communities cannot in any case imply economic or social privileges Well such rules are exceptions for the Basque and Navarra provinces with the first additional provision of the Constitution a special law without comparison in comparative law to which the tenor the Constitution protects and respects the historical rights of the outlying territories Ladies and gentlemen asymmetries which involve significant inequalities between Spaniards and privileges for those subject to the outlaw regime have been repeatedly highlighted by both the doctrine and the national and European courts Some examples that this is a privileged system for Navarre are as follows First example de facto separated marriage with two minor children The husband resides outside the Community of Navarre and the wife with the children in Navarra territory If the children are dependent on him it shall be understood that the husband also resides in Navarre for tax purposes article 8.3 b of Law 28/1990 Second example marriage that opts for joint taxation The wife usually works and resides in Logroño has annual gross salaries of 45 000 euros and her liquidated base for the purposes of IRPF is 27 000 according to her personal circumstances and the regulations of La Rioja The husband usually works and resides in Pamplona has an annual gross remuneration of 40,000 euros that is 5000 less than his wife and his liquidated base for the purposes of IRPF is 29,000 euros that is 2000 more than his wife 's according in fact to his personal circumstances and to Navarra 's tax regulations It is therefore for the Foral Community of Navarre to levy the tax and this is determined by Article 9.2 of Law 28/1990 Third example a company with a registered office and a prosecutor in Madrid and which temporarily operates exclusively in Navarre although its social purpose allows it to do so throughout the national territory Its total volume of operations in the previous year has exceeded EUR 10 million and taxed corporation tax in Navarre Article 19.1 b of Law 28/1990 Fourth and last example wooden furniture manufacturing company with registered office in Santander The furniture is manufactured in its Santander factory but is varnished and packaged for distribution to retailers on a ship located in Pamplona and the latter accounts for approximately 12 of the total manufacturing process An operation carried out in Navarre for tax purposes Article 21 A 1st of Law 28/1990 In short a modern State needs to be at the service of unity and equality and should not be subject to different tax regimes for the different regions which protected from a supposed historical origin perpetuate inequalities between Spaniards distort national unity and make some Spaniards better than others because they were born in one or another region Thus VOX understands that equality between Spaniards and national unity makes it necessary to oppose this regime and any of its renewals On the basis of the foregoing we call for the Government to be returned to the draft law which is the subject of this amendment I shall conclude Mr President Thank God in Spain as in Europe is the time of patriots Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,-4.2592783,-13.333887,7,"coming presidency ladies gentlemen representatives foral community navarre vox parliamentary group tabled amendment full return

#CalandriniNicola,Mr President we are proud and delighted to speak today on a subject for which a bill of parliamentary initiative is finally being called into question In fact as you know Mr Undersecretary it has unfortunately not been possible in recent years since we have been clogged up by the urgent decree that has not allowed us to do the work that Parliament is called upon to do to put the initiative of its Members at the centre This is a happy moment for us a time when a bill signed by one of our colleagues Senator Iannone of the Brothers of Italy introduces a change in the Constitution aimed at recognizing the importance of sport filling a serious present gap evidently before this moment Brothers of Italy through this amendment demanded that Article 32 of the Constitution be added a paragraph that would protect sports activities and guarantee access to sports practice The original text stated The Republic also protects health through the promotion of activities aimed at engaging and developing the psychomotor skills of people and facilitates access to sports practice With this reading sport and health are made complementary to each other and therefore sport is recognized and counted among fundamental constitutional rights such as education health and environmental protection bearer of values such as fair competition and solidarity Italy clearly adapts to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that the Union contributes to the promotion of European profiles of sport taking into account its specific features its structures based on volunteering and its social and educational function Italy with the approval of this amendment to the Constitution would also make a further step forward compared to other European countries since the recognition of the value of sport in the Constitution to date exists only in a few European states such as Bulgaria Croatia Greece Lithuania Poland Portugal Romania Spain and Hungary The text submitted to the Assembly is the summary of a series of different but convergent constitutional bills presented by various different parliamentary groups and proposes through its only article to add a paragraph to Article 33 of the Constitution The provision provides that the Republic recognizes the educational social and promotional value of the psychophysical well being of sports activity in all its forms The content of this value is then declined in three directions that are not in hierarchical relationship with each other but equiordained and complementary The placement in Article 33 made it preferable to indicate first the educational value for the growth and training of the person This is accompanied by social value sport is often an antidote to degradation and social exclusion it is the basis of countless realities in the third sector and in general it is a powerful factor of aggregation at all levels including the entire national community Finally there is the value for health declined from the text in the most specific terms of promoting psychophysical well being to indicate a positive understanding of the concept of health not only as absence of pathologies but as an improvement of the physical and mental conditions of each individual We hope Mr President in Office that the approval of this amendment will take place soon to this end everyone 's cooperation will be important In our view before the end of this parliamentary term we could have this rule in the Constitution This will depend on the will of Parliament but also of the Government The successive governments over the years seem to have recognized the value of sport only when Italy won the European Football Championship when Berrettini arrived in the final at Wimbledon or when the Ferrari returned to make their fans dream again Sport before being passionate must be well being sport arrives where state and institutions often fail to reach helping to spread the values on which our national identity is based For Brothers of Italy it is not a question of a flag because for us sport is exactly the opposite It is no coincidence that Giorgia Meloni in these years of pandemic has asked several times to have the sport taken up again obviously in safety not as access to the stadium but as a sport activity Sport in fact is life and it makes no sense to have facilities gyms and swimming pools closed and see public transport full of people In this regard our national leader in these years of pandemics has waged a battle Mr Undersecretary before the pandemic sport generated 4 of our national gross domestic product Now he is on his knees many realities have closed down and those who resist very often do so in the total indifference of the State who has not been able to give strong and concrete help and indeed with the history of the super greenpass has cut out many teenagers many of our children from sports activities interrupting dreams ambitions but also strong occasions of sociality 17.28 Followed by Mr Calandrini We of Brothers of Italy hope that the approval of the norm and its incorporation into the Constitution will also help to avoid such distortions in the future We hope then that the adoption of the bill will be the beginning of the reversal of a path with greater attention to politics in the world of sport and perhaps also that it will be evident in the restoration of a Ministry dedicated to this competence,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-2.852893,-16.13997,7,mr president proud delighted speak today subject bill

#deBertoldiAndrea,DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President for an exponent of the Brothers of Italy who before being a majority or opposition party is a political force that has the values of the Homeland in its DNA it can only be an honor and a moment of emotion to take the floor to express its vote in favour of the establishment of a day that must recognize the role that the Alpine Corps has had and continues to have in the history of Italy When we talk about the Alps Mr President we are not only talking about a body one of the main pillars of the Italian Armed Forces but also about a reality that is a pillar of civil protection a reality that today is almost fundamental in determining the solidarity that unites the Italian people This is the Alpine Corps these are the Alps And so says a senator who did n't make the alpine who was n't lucky enough to be an alpine but he has an alpine father a father of ninety nine years still alive who could glorify himself with the presence in the Alpine Corps I am part of a territory Trentino Alto Adige in which the feeling of brotherhood towards this military body is really important For us the Alps have always been beyond politics and even beyond age a reference point I believe that in our valleys in our countries in our territories there are opportunities to be confronted with the solidarity of the alpine young and old When we talk about the Alps when we have to recognize the role that the Alps have in the history of our country we certainly refer first of all as well highlighted in the bill to the battle of Nikolajewka a battle that as someone before me said was not only heroic from the military point of view but it was a battle that really allowed many Italians to gain esteem and respect regardless of the historical moment in which they lived So this is an acknowledgment that history must bestow on the glory of the Alpine Corps The Alpines are represented by a simple symbol but recognized by children of all ages the black pen which can be declined in the brown or white color of the generals which is one of the symbols of Italianity next to the tricolor I really believe that the Alpine pen as a symbol of this country is surely recognized in a cross-cutting way A symbol that approaches the motto of the Alps a motto that we must remember to ourselves to every citizen The motto This is where you do n't pass We must reflect on what it means on the topicality of that motto today as then today as tomorrow From here one does not pass it certainly indicates the defense of the borders of which Brothers of Italy boasts I remember especially to those who exhumed the tricolor during the World Cup of football that defense of borders means defence of values it means defence of traditions it means defence of the heritage of our fathers That 's patriotism This is the love of homeland This in fact represents the defense of borders Defense that the alpine have always exercised with honor and glory and deep respect for the opponents But defense of borders also means something else it also means the confrontation between good and evil and knowing always be on the side of good When there are calamities when there are tragedies when there are pandemics since we are living unfortunately also this epoch in those moments the Alps are there because this means in that case the defense of the borders This means that we do not pass from here This is n't where the evil goes this is where the negativity does n't pass The alpine is a bulwark of good The Alpine bulwark of solidarity the Alpine bulwark of our values We must remember this and we must remember this every January 26 because it is a debt we owe to all those soldiers and to all those soldiers who in the past as in the present defend our territory and our values Mr President I conclude with a current and political reflection From this point of view we should start by reconsidering compulsory military service a military service that could give many young people a definite commitment of course to training Of course we must not go back but we must re-evaluate a service that allows our young people to acquire civic awareness and enable them to feed that chain of solidarity represented by the National Alpine Association which is unfortunately falling in numerical terms for the ageing of their members but that each of us knows how important it is in the chain of solidarity We can therefore also draw political reflection from the recognition of their role and of this important Day,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#TosatoPaolo,TOSATO L SP PSd Az Mr President on behalf of the League Group I too would like to join in the speeches of my fellow Members in thanking the quaestors for the work they have done over the past five years We have entrusted this task surely to attentive caring and conscientious people in managing the Senate budget so we thank Senators De Poli Bottici and Arrigoni for the work they have done on behalf of the whole House I would also like to thank the entire administration of the Senate starting with the Secretary General the Deputy Secretaries the directors the officials and all the staff that has accompanied us over the past five years with great professionalism with great competence with great willingness to face every situation even emerging that has occurred in the eighteenth legislature Surely there was no manual to manage what has happened to us so starting from the quaestors senators and from the whole structure there was a demonstration of efficiency in adapting to the needs that the country was experiencing and that consequently also lived the Senate guaranteeing the safety of the health of all those who work in this great structure but at the same time without that the works had a bending in the times and the quality of the service that we must guarantee regarding the legislative activity I believe that we have dealt with this emergency in the best possible way and we must thank those who have put this task on their shoulders As regards the 2021 and 2022 internal financial statements the Group will vote in favour We appreciate the fact that despite the difficulties there has been a surplus over the previous year of 3.5 million and we hope that the next budgets will still be in the virtuous line that this College of Quaestors has drawn The challenge of the next parliamentary term will be to demonstrate that in view of Parliament 's decision to reduce the number of Members the effectiveness of legislative activity in the Commissions and in this House will not be diminished it will be necessary to ensure that this virtuous process can continue thanks to the choice of Parliament and the electoral body which in a referendum has confirmed the reduction in the number of Members thereby achieving further savings It is obvious that the reduction of parliamentarians may lead to potential difficulties in the management of the work and in the representativeness of the territory We hope however that it will have the virtuous aspect of reducing the costs of public and political machinery as requested by the community I would like to thank President Casellati and Vice Presidents including Senator Calderoli who is chairing the Assembly today and I would like to thank the whole structure of the Senate once again,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,2.061681,-8.962823,7,tosato l sp psd az mr president behalf league group would like join speeches fellow members thanking quaestors work done past five years entrusted task surely attentive caring conscientious people managing senate budget thank senators de poli bottici arrigoni work done behalf whole house would also like thank entire administration senate starting secretary general deputy secretaries directors officials staff accompanied us past five years great professionalism great competence great willingness face every situation even emerging occurred eighteenth legislature surely manual manage happened us starting quaestors senators whole structure demonstration efficiency adapting needs country experiencing consequently also lived senate guaranteeing safety health work great structure time without works bending times quality service must guarantee regarding legislative activity believe dealt emergency best possible way must thank put task shoulders regards 2021 2022 internal financial statements group vote favour appreciate fact despite difficulties surplus previous year 3.5 million hope next budgets still virtuous line college quaestors drawn challenge next parliamentary term demonstrate view parliament 's decision reduce number members effectiveness legislative activity commissions house diminished necessary ensure virtuous process continue thanks choice parliament electoral body referendum confirmed reduction number members thereby achieving savings obvious reduction parliamentarians may lead potential difficulties management work representativeness territory hope however virtuous aspect reducing costs public political machinery requested community would like thank president casellati vice presidents including senator calderoli chairing assembly today would like thank whole structure senate
#MalanLucio,Mr President ladies and gentlemen let us remember that this reform of the Senate 's Rules of Procedure is not the first of recent times At the end of the last parliamentary term a very important one was adopted which introduced some rules to speed up the work and which if adopted by the other branch of Parliament would make it easier for certain aspects of the process of passing the laws This reform is mainly due to the reduction in the number of parliamentarians approved with an amendment to the Constitution which required at least to adapt certain numbers such as the minimum number of senators to form a parliamentary group or to request votes of a certain type These numbers obviously had to be adapted to the new reality On this we all agreed as well as on some speeches not necessarily related to the issue of the number of senators but to common sense I am thinking of the rule set out by President Pesco of which I have shared many of the arguments and which he has presented The Budget Committee is always overworked It is for the work it does generally for the truth but when the Government does not cooperate as has happened lately and does not provide technical relations the work stops completely The proposal which has been unanimously adopted and which is now of course submitted to the House 's decision is that the budget Commission should not give its opinion on all the amendments but only on those adopted This of course greatly reduces work and makes it possible for this to be done even more precisely and precisely We as the Brothers of Italy Group and specifically Senator Zaffini and I who have followed the work of the Committee for the Rules of Procedure have not shared some points of this reform outside the issue of numbers which I summarize here One aspect relates to senators who do not subscribe to any group Until now those who left one Group and did not enter another either by their own will or because no one accepted it joined the Mixed Group which has a particular situation With the text that arrives in this House which can always be modified by the amendments it is expected that senators who leave their group and do not pass on to another will become non-attached to any group It is a curious thing because already today there is the institute of senators not enrolled in any group but it is a privilege of senators for life I call this privilege without any negative connotations The senators for life have a particular profile they are former Presidents of the Republic and people appointed for very high merits as the Constitution provides so it is also normal that they may not join any Group The current Regulation provides for this as a possibility not as an obligation That is why it is clearly a privilege Now providing any senator with the opportunity to enjoy this privilege we do not believe to be acceptable The intention is to discourage the transitions from one group to another but let us not forget that we are at a time when the parties have been belittled subjected for decades to accusations of all kinds Let 's be clear the parties have made many serious mistakes but this is in the dynamics of things if they were all perfect a perfect party would suffice but thanks to heaven there is no one and therefore there is pluralism However the fact of getting rid of any party label and even the label of the Mixed Group is frankly a privilege that can be good for the senators for life on whose discipline we would have liked to intervene more widely because we do not think it positive to have as has happened in the past government majorities that stand on the senators for life appointed in an indispensable way by the President of the Republic However since there are we do not find it positive to equate to them senators who either by their own will or because no Group receives them remain without Group the only disadvantage they have is that of not being able to take advantage of the support of the Groups However especially in a Senate with reduced numbers where every senator is worth 0.5 per cent of the Assembly there are not only the structures that the Senate can offer there are immense interests outside the Chambers that have no problem financing all the needs of a senator provided that he puts himself at the service of those interests I believe that we must guarantee each senator the same support since with or without a group his vote is as valid as that of those who were from the first to the last day in the same Group at least to prevent someone from helping enormously higher interests as an entity and often also as a power even political Just think about when Klaus Schwab a private citizen makes invitations to the World Economic Forum and leaders from all over the world run by a private person who evidently has unlimited economic possibilities through him and his friends I say this to give an example but this afternoon during immediate questions we will talk about a single official of the Government who with a small signature guarantees a billion as a gift for Covid refreshments to the poor Benetton and the subsequent managers of the highways This is the real money not the small funds that the Groups have or can support a Member With regard to questions there is not only the question raised by an interesting amendment that Senator Pesco mentioned earlier about the possibility which certainly needs to be studied of being able to question the members of the Authorities in some way There is in fact a problem in this particular case mentioned by my colleague At present the Independent Authority regulating gas prices is making sure that there is a crest on the price of gas which has already tremendously increased Based only on spot prices and not on long term contracts which make up the bulk of gas supply a real crest is created for gas distributors and sellers This is an example it is good that these Authorities are independent but they cannot be totally indisputable and above any possibility of information investigation inspection activity which does not mean going to the place but asking questions and having answers In this regard I move on to another important aspect which is not the subject of the reform and there is no need for it to be I am referring to questions there are not only questions to those to whom they cannot be addressed today but the Government under the Rules of Procedure should reply to all questions within twenty days the answer to a question has however become a part of the lot i.e. it can also happen to receive an answer as in the case where going to play three numbers these are extracted and a certain sum is won Instead this would be a duty of the government It is particularly serious that no answers are received on issues where the government then takes decisions In fact as long as they are answers to issues outside the government 's action at that time in the new measures they are fine But when we have a topic that is being carried out by the government and it does not respond to what it does it is really very serious and breaks the balance that should be there In fact as we are a parliamentary republic there should be Parliament above the government Sometimes we 're really underneath I would add another aspect that is parliamentary practice which is certainly not found in the regulations that say nothing about it Not many years ago in most cases when the rapporteurs gave their opinions they also explained why they were in favour or opposed to a certain amendment In most cases when there were thousands explanations were given to groups Well lately we see the rapporteur turning too often perhaps almost always into the reader of the opinions that are given to him by the Government as the rapporteur himself sometimes says This is not written in the Rules of Procedure which does not prohibit it and does not impose it but I believe that the Senate has a duty to regain its dignity As has been said the reduction in the number of senators does not mean less work and should not mean less role but more role However this also depends on the political will of individual groups and senators who must not be mortified,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,0.8262128,-12.575025,7,mr president

#MalanLucio,Mr President representative of the Government fellow Senators in the electoral programme of Brothers of Italy for the policies of 2018 there was a point entitled Contrast to poverty efficient social policies and health protection which included this sentence Inclusion of sport in the Constitution as an essential tool of physical and mental well being value added contrast to youthful deviances and ensuring motor activity from primary school to senior age We are therefore particularly pleased that a point in our programme is being achieved despite the fact that we have been in opposition during these four years of parliamentary term On 6 August 2018 in fact Senators Antonio Iannone and Nicola Calandrini of Fratelli d'Italia presented in line with this point of the program a constitutional bill in this sense in order to include sports practice in the Constitution Last year further draft laws were presented by other Senate Groups and this led to very positive cooperation within the Committee on Constitutional Affairs I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Grimani and all the Members of the Commission for the spirit has really been designed to produce a text that satisfies everyone and is as appropriate effective as possible written in a form appropriate to the Constitution The importance of sports activity in our country has always grown For a long time it has been an activity reserved for a few high income and high level social people who could have some leisure time to devote to sport especially as young people There has been a progressive enlargement thanks also to the top sport which has made known legendary or otherwise well known figures of sport in many areas We know that football is one of the most followed disciplines but at the Olympics for example there is a great general enthusiasm for all sports This is important because it has not only brought extraordinary results which have given great satisfaction to Italians as spectators as well as as as athletes in many sectors in the Olympics and in the great sports competitions but also because it represented a great stimulus for many children and young people who said But then I can do it too They saw the companies of great champions and understood that they could do so too Gradually the awareness that physical and sporting activity is an aspect of education growth and social inclusion has increased and has led to a progressive involvement of increasingly wider parts of our population So the top sport also pulls the basic sport Obviously it is a source of great prestige and satisfaction to see our athletes and our teams achieve great results but this is particularly important when it pushes so many young people to this practice that brings benefits to physical health to the sense of values solidarity and loyalty which are fundamental aspects of sport as well as in terms of inclusion In sport except for episodes of boycotts and closures that I consider not positive there has always been the encounter between athletes of many countries of all social strata and of all political ideas and religions Sport has been a great tool for integration and inclusion For this reason we have been opposed to the exclusion in these years of so many young people which still lasts for medical choices that have often been not theirs but their parents Sport is inclusion and keeping someone out is really against the sport spirit Sport is also included for women girls and girls In fact we know that at the beginning women 's sports practice was greatly hindered and there was a natural skepticism also on the part of families that male children did sports while daughters girls other things If there are health benefits sport must obviously be open to all Here too there has been the phenomenon of great characters of the top sport one of these we have before us and it is the undersecretary Valentina Vezzali who represents the Government who have given the example of extraordinary sporting successes and also of extraordinary humanity These people are not in a separate world but they are part of society they have roles in the family and then maybe they enter political activity This has certainly contributed decisively to the development of sports practice at all levels for both males and females Speaking of women 's sports we can only look with concern at what is happening more and more often and also in Italy even in a less explosive way than what we have seen happen in the United States I refer to gentlemen with all the characteristics from head to toe of males who say they feel female and therefore compete in women 's categories It is an obnoxious and a mockery for women who play sports and engage who find themselves competing with men who in most sports are benefited by their skeletal and muscular structure and their metabolism Brothers of Italy is particularly proud to have contributed decisively starting the discussion that today leads to the inclusion of sport in the Constitution This is not a goal in itself but a further push to make sport increasingly accessible to all For many Italians the sport practice is discreetly and sufficiently accessible but for many others still not There are still too many schools that have completely inadequate gyms or even do not have them and there are many of our young people and children who do not have this possibility Sport must be accessible to all including people with disabilities We have also recently seen summit sport at the Paralympics It is important that athletes who reach high levels encourage people with physical problems to engage in sports practice which for them is perhaps even more beneficial than for others Therefore this inclusion which we naturally hope will be crowned by the adoption of the bill in the subsequent readings that the Constitution provides both as a stimulus and as a stimulus when it comes to allocating resources and taking measures to make sport accessible to all to put ourselves truly committed to the search for the resources that are needed in the certainty that sport must be accessible to all as a means of cohesion and inclusion and as an instrument to place young people in a context that is attentive to values loyalty and self training in the most appropriate way to a true citizen,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-2.8059938,-16.28166,7,mr president representative government fellow senators electoral programme brothers italy policies 2018 point entitled

#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President after the memory of Senator Carrara so well expressed by you President and Senator Gallone I would like to add a few words Valerio has been a senator for three legislatures and has been in this Chamber for twelve years He arrived unexpectedly but he was able to interpret very well his role as representative of the citizens in general and of his territory to which he was so attached as has been said just now He has always taken with detachment irony and even self irony the successes The fact of having reached the role of senator for a person who has always had the passion of politics and the administration of its territory was certainly a great satisfaction as well as being elected for two other legislatures and becoming president of the Defence Commission which led with capacity and balance They were certainly great successes but they did not change his smiling and conscious attitude of the transitoryness of all the roles held In the same way he was able to deal with the fierce criticisms that were also made in one of the many political conflicts that often happen as it should be in this House I remember as she said earlier her passion for nature for its mountains for its municipality when he was elected mayor with a large majority of votes I remember well that he told me several times having passed through medical and surgical events in similar times After what I 've been through I 've been saved by surgeons in an almost miraculous way everything that comes after me is a great gift and I 'm trying to enjoy it to make it the best in my life Hence his love for his family for his mountains and for nature in which he tried to immerse himself as much as possible moreover living in a mountain country was easier I 've always felt it with great serenity and awareness that he really had to savor these years of his life no matter how long they were Unfortunately they ended a few days ago but we know that we had as a friend and colleague a real person a person who was able to express the sentiment of so many of our fellow citizens who we have the honour to represent here On behalf of the whole Group of the Brothers of Italy I offer my condolences to his family to whom he was so attached remembering him with affection and bearing in our hearts his beautiful memory,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,3.2592986,-7.9025526,7,mr malan fdi mr president memory senator carrara well expressed president senator gallone would like add words valerio senator three legislatures chamber twelve years arrived unexpectedly able interpret well role representative citizens general territory attached said always taken detachment irony even self irony successes fact reached role senator person always passion politics administration territory certainly great satisfaction well elected two legislatures becoming president defence commission led capacity balance certainly great successes change smiling conscious attitude transitoryness roles held way able deal fierce criticisms also made one many political conflicts often happen house remember said earlier passion nature mountains municipality elected mayor large majority votes remember well told several times passed medical surgical events similar times 've 've saved surgeons almost miraculous way everything comes great gift 'm trying enjoy make best life hence love family mountains nature tried immerse much possible moreover living mountain country easier 've always felt great serenity awareness really savor years life matter long unfortunately ended days ago know friend colleague real person person able express sentiment many fellow citizens honour represent behalf whole group brothers italy offer condolences family attached remembering affection bearing hearts beautiful memory

#AlessandriniValeria,ALESSANDRINI L- SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen the Government I would like to thank the rapporteurs Senator Nencini and Senator Cangini and the Government in the person of our Undersecretary Lucia Borgonzoni for involving me as an active part of this process as a Umbrian Member of Parliament I thank President Donatella Tesei together with her we have carefully followed the whole process of this bill that has carried on until today and goes to confirm that since we were elected we are spending on the valorization of our territory This bill is also very important in this key We are going to vote today on a measure that comes after a path shared with all the actors involved made of comparisons meetings and proposals We managed to achieve a synthesis very quickly thanks to the active collaboration of every political religious spiritual and institutional component Allow me to express my great satisfaction at the acceptance in the Commission of the amendments tabled which in the celebratory activities strengthen the presence of the territory that has seen the birth and growth of St. Francis Umbria is a land that has given birth to many saints and which is deeply linked to its cultural and Christian roots in particular to the figure of St. Francis It is true that St. Francis is the patron saint of Italy and not only represents Assisi or Umbria but as Umbria we are proud that he was born and lived in our Region We are proud to find his traces in the many places that Francis touched on his journey and that he listed our colleague but we are aware that his spiritual heritage and his message do not belong to us The Franciscan message is in fact a true patrimony of humanity so timely that it is included in the draft law under consideration A provision that in Article 1 states that the Republic celebrates the figure of Saint Francis of Assisi on the occasion of the eighth centenary of death can only meet our approval because celebrating Francis means recognizing the value of our roots of our historical and cultural heritage it means leaving it as a legacy to future generations and sharing it with the rest of the world Let us not forget in fact that the figure of St. Francis is also known and loved abroad The bill provides for the establishment of the national committee with the task of developing a cultural program related to life work and places related to the figure of the saint including restoration activities of things subject to the protection of cultural and landscape heritage as well as research activities editorials training exhibitions and the organization and management of events in the cultural historical literary scientific and artistic fields of high value All this in a modern and modern perspective is the figure of Francis A perspective of internationalization tourism promotion and technological innovation but above all as mentioned focusing attention on the aspects of the Franciscan message concerning respect and care for the environment dialogue between religions and peaceful coexistence between peoples A current message today more than ever in this historical moment a figure to which to vote with authentic faith in the hope that its protection can wrap all peoples today tormented by events we would never have expected to witness and live Among the aims the main one will be to disseminate in Italy and abroad the knowledge of the thought and work of man and of the saint who has been able to leave an indelible trace in his journey This will also be possible through the involvement of the fields of school education high artistic musical and coreautic training university and research but the committee will also have the task of developing programmes aimed at promoting cultural activities related to the celebration involving public or private bodies of proven experience Another important function will be to prepare programs aimed at promoting processes of cultural development in the territory of valorization and tourist promotion of the Franciscan places and paths and of commercial promotion in the cultural context related to the celebration Last but not least there will be important editorial publications of undoubted historical and cultural value In the light of the above I declare the vote in favour of the Senators of the Lega Salvini

#IannoneAntonio,Mr President ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen for Brothers of Italy sport has never been a B series subject In the electoral program of our party which we had submitted to the voters in 2018 we wrote with our leader Giorgia Meloni that sport had to find this its recognition in the Constitution Today is therefore a happy day but also important The hope is that this process will know its completion Since the first days of the legislature we have devoted ourselves to this bill precisely the Senate Act 747 which I presented together with my colleague Mr Calandrini who did not say so in his speech There is a historical sensitivity of the right on this subject I would like to remind this House that the first to present a bill for the recognition of sport in Constitution was the late Senator Giulio Maceratini Leader of the National Alliance in those years Today we are happy after the excellent work that has been done in my opinion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and I would like to thank President Parrini the rapporteur Mr Grimani and of course also undersecretary Vezzali who in his opinion knows well what this moment represents for a universe of positivity which is our world of sport It is the recognition that must be given to the victories of our champions that excite us and strengthen the sense of belonging to the national community but it is also the recognition to all that world of the basic practice of sport which stubbornly makes sacrifices to achieve those objectives and those goals that all the colleagues who have spoken in this House have stated For these reasons we have the duty to give this world the recognition to which it has longed for years moreover at a time of great difficulty as Mr Calandrini has reminded us in which sudden choices in our opinion have undermined and brought to their knees all those who want to continue to exercise this passion in order to ensure that sport is and continues to be at all times education sociality and health protection through a healthy lifestyle I believe that today 's passage must be dedicated first and foremost to this world that deserves in its entirety with the vow of each one of you to know a new beginning and to be recognized for what it is We are talking about people who represent a great school of life and who make sure that every difference and every barrier falls through sports practice It is a world that keeps many young people away from the deviances and the road and that in many cases represents let me say especially in the South the only positive social outlet that young people have through the culture of sports sacrifice also understand how man is built in life And since examples gestures experience are worth more than so much theory and often rhetoric we think that today we start a process that is going to give credit to that world of sport that thinks its turnover is passion,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-2.482665,-15.817913,7,mr president ladies gentlemen ladies gentlemen brothers italy sport never b series subject electoral program party submitted voters 2018 wrote leader giorgia meloni sport find recognition constitution today therefore happy day also important hope process know completion since first days legislature devoted bill precisely senate act 747 presented together colleague mr calandrini say speech historical sensitivity right subject would like remind house first present bill recognition sport constitution late senator giulio maceratini leader national alliance years today happy excellent work done opinion committee constitutional affairs would like thank president parrini rapporteur mr grimani course also undersecretary vezzali opinion knows well moment represents universe positivity world sport recognition must given victories champions excite us strengthen sense belonging national community also recognition world basic practice sport stubbornly makes sacrifices achieve objectives goals colleagues spoken house stated reasons duty give world recognition longed years moreover time great difficulty mr calandrini reminded us sudden choices opinion undermined brought knees want continue exercise passion order ensure sport continues times education sociality health protection healthy lifestyle believe today 's passage must dedicated first foremost world deserves entirety vow one know new beginning recognized talking people represent great school life make sure every difference every barrier falls sports practice world keeps many young people away deviances road many cases represents let say especially south positive social outlet young people culture sports sacrifice also understand man built life since examples gestures experience worth much theory often rhetoric think today start process going give credit world sport thinks turnover passion
#IannoneAntonio,Mr President in fact with regard to what we said at the time of the first passage of the measure in the Senate I would like to express my satisfaction with the Presidency and all the parliamentary groups for the prompt timing of the measure under consideration precisely at the end of the three months This indicates that there is obviously a strong awareness in all political forces that this amendment to the Constitution with the recognition of sporting activity in all its forms can give the sporting world the dignity it deserves In our view the dictation is clear but of course we are sure that the Presidency will be able to clear up precisely on the issue of not less than three months time In any case it seems to us a highly qualified moment in this Parliament to give the possibility to the constitutional change under consideration to know its light That of sport is a world that represents the best story in our opinion of our nation because as we have had the opportunity to reiterate also with the undersecretary Vezzali on the occasion of a demonstration held at the CONI has given our homeland a lustre for which we must be grateful We must also be aware of the fact that sports practice has a social reverberation of extreme positivity in all its aspects because sport represents for all Italian citizens of every age group especially for our young people a positive model that transmits values that today there is an infinite need Sport is also the best tool for social inclusion erases differences promotes the culture of merit and sacrifice breaks down differences and barriers and represents a metaphor of life in which everyone starts from the same starting point but then the best must go and go further We have always felt that sport should be recognised in the Constitution It is a historical fact that goes beyond this parliamentary term I would like to remind you once again that the first draft constitutional amendment that provided for this recognition was by the leader of Alleanza Nazionale the late Giulio Maceratini in 1996 We are not interested in placing a flag but in the political program of Brothers of Italy our leader Giorgia Meloni wanted expressly to include this point as a qualification of our political proposal on sport Therefore as early as August 2018 a few months after the beginning of the current legislature I presented draft law n. 747 We are delighted that there is this determination on the part of the whole of Parliament We are very happy with the interlocutions that have been made in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the definition that has been found Our draft law provided for a link to Article 32 of the Constitution because we believed that health protection was the main issue But we are also very satisfied with the work that has been done and I would like to thank the Undersecretary Vezzali for the work he has done I am convinced and hope there are all the prerequisites that we can all achieve together in the current legislature this great goal that renders justice to a world that with its turnover of passion represents Italy 's commitment sacrifice and merit,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-3.3318129,-16.278933,7,mr president fact regard said time first passage measure senate would like express satisfaction presidency

#SaponaraMaria,SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen the government both ancient and modern historians in speaking of the Emperor Trajan describe him as the best among the Roman emperors calling him optimus princes and this for his great gifts not only of general but also of administrator and politician qualities that allowed him to realize important territorial conquests and to accompany them with a vast program of public works of which still in Rome itself we can admire the greatness in the testimonies that are visible to all It is in this vast program of public works that was also part of the construction between 108 and 110 after Christ of the Via Traiana and the Arch of Traiano in 114 after Christ at Benevento which we go to this House today to declare a national monument These brief historical hints have absolutely no presumption of being a lesson in history but only to make people reflect on the importance they have and can assume works like the Arch of Trajan which in full merit of being declared a national monument for what it represents and not only for the architectural and artistic value it covers It is in fact evident to everyone how its grandeur its architectural structure its rich sculptural decoration make it deserve in full the definition of cultural good It is less obvious what lies behind its construction and which should be seen as a political example to be applied in our day Mr President This magnificent architectural work was in fact erected to celebrate the conclusion of the works of the already mentioned Via Traiana that for those times represented an important artery of connection between the western part of the peninsula and the ports of the east coast that facilitated the movement of goods people and traffics from and to the East It is therefore a work of great political and administrative far sightedness realized in a very short time that allowed Rome and the cities placed to the West of our peninsula not to remain excluded from the commercial traffics towards the East and to reach those parts of the territory of the present Puglia generous of salt so much so that it is then counted among the streets of salt The Arch of Traiano therefore to be seen represents a victory the fulfilment of an administrative and political decision that is the decision to build an infrastructure designed to bring benefits to the territories This is what makes the Arch of Trajan deserve the name of a national monument even more than its artistic and architectural value If for Benevento and its citizens the declaration of national monument of the Arch of Trajan will be an extra boast for their historical and cultural heritage for all must also represent and imply a political value of openness and foresight of the past applicable to our days which we must therefore make our own for the reasons just said And for this reason it must encourage us to undertake and not to hinder the realization of works and infrastructures beneficial for our country perhaps in a short time For its historical and architectural value and even more for its political value therefore the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will vote in favour of the declaration of national monument of the Arch of Trajan of Benevento,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo

#SaponaraMaria,SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government the declaration of the Teatro Regio di Parma as a national monument aims to achieve a prestigious goal for Parma and its cultural historical and musical tradition And this is because the Teatro Regio is not only a neoclassical building of great artistic and architectural value built at the beginning of the nineteenth century but it is much more So let 's go see why it 's so important to Parma If we trace its history over time we see that the Teatro Regio was conceived within a program of redevelopment and valorization during the government of Maria Luigia of Habsburg Duchess of the Duchy of Parma Piacenza and Guastalla from 1816 to 1847 The Duchess wanted to make Parma a city worthy of the European capitals a very high ambition pursued by an enlightened sovereign as she was that with her good government she could give Parma a new face of which even today Parmesan and tourists can enjoy And if we think that this plan was conceived two hundred years ago with results that gave Parma the face of a city of high civilization and culture today we can do nothing but take example trying to be forward looking and with our actions and decisions as well as with the means at our disposal to realize in our territories works that enhance them and can be enjoyed by the citizens the Teatro Regio therefore as an example of good governance to which we have the duty to render honor and inspire us The Teatro Regio moreover since its inauguration in 1829 has been one of the places where important pages of the history of Parma and its territory have been written And all this must not be lost or forgotten because it is always being attached to our origins and to our history that we can value our present In it were celebrated musical events of the highest level thanks above all to that opera tradition linked to Giuseppe Verdi which precisely in Parma and in the native Busseto finds its maximum commemoration Let 's not forget that the Teatro Regio di Parma is the witness and protagonist of the crucial changes that invest the melodrama during the nineteenth and the following century from the end of the epoch linked to the name of Rossini to the supremacy of the Verdi repertoire from the opening to the French and German experiences to the Italian work of Mascagni Leoncavallo and Puccini However even in recent history there have been important moments of social life as when outside on December 26 1968 on the occasion of the inauguration of the opera season there was a tearing popular and especially youthful protest the daughter of the great protest in place in those times of change When we say Teatro Regio national monument therefore we do not just want to affirm and pay homage to the artistic and architectural importance of this beautiful building that overlooks one of the streets most frequented by Parmesan but we want to say much more Therefore we have a duty to make the most of it also as an expression of Parma 's potential in the music field Just as the Verdi Festival is an important showcase that Parma has been able to build to enhance its Verdi tradition thanks to its lyric workers in the same way the recognition as a national monument by Parliament goes in the direction of the maximum valorization of the Theatre as the glory of Parma its history and its cultural and musical tradition We can also continue by saying that the Teatro Regio national monument is also the continuation of a journey undertaken with Parma Italian capital of culture I would say a sort of icing on the cake from which it is necessary to start with events and initiatives of international scope putting at the center its main and historical theatre and its workers If it is true that among the driving engines of the economy of our country and cities like Parma there is tourism then it is very important to take hold of our cultural heritage in all its forms valorizing all aspects to make truly alive and driving that tourism that otherwise without culture would remain an empty box The Teatro Regio is part of this heritage both as it is visible from an artistic and architectural point of view as well as from what it represents Having listed some of the symbolic aspects that it brings with it I would like to conclude with some reference to its artistic and architectural characteristics not because it is of secondary importance but because I think it is always necessary to go beyond the tangible beauty to grasp much more The construction began in 1821 on a project by the court architect Nicola Bettoli and the Theatre was inaugurated on May 16 1829 with Zaira by Vincenzo Bellini The Theatre is in neoclassical style the façade is characterized by an Ionic colonnade and a large terminal window that opens in the upper part After passing the atrium you enter the room of the foyer marked by two rows of four columns a staircase leads to the hall of the reduced where was the throne of Maria Luigia Through the portal of honour you enter the heart of the building the hall with the audience four orders of stages and the loggione dominated by the ceiling painted by Giovan Battista Borghesi The curtain one of the few to come to us is also the work of the Borghesi The appearance of the hall today is very different from the original Girolamo Magnani who was among other things a decorator that Verdi often wanted at his side as a set designer was commissioned by Carlo III of Bourbon to renew the robe of the Teatro Regio according to the neo-Renaissance style The acoustic chamber painted by Giuseppe Carmignani one of the rare examples that survived the use and the time resumes the decorations of the stages and consists of hemp panels mounted on wooden frames telescopically modular to serve the most diverse orchestral formations Originally this is a curiosity the Theatre was intended to host performances of various kinds from funambolism to gymnastics numbers with trained animals scientific demonstrations illusionism and also various curiosities Of great value is the clock which marks the time of works and concerts that have followed on the stage of the Theatre since 1829 In 2018 after a year of restoration the historic watch of the Teatro Regio created by Antonio Barozzi came back to work This brief description makes evident the artistic and architectural value of the Teatro Regio di Parma but as I have said several times in this speech his declaration as a national monument wants to be not only the exaltation of a beautiful neoclassical architecture but also and above all the valorization of what it represents for Parma and what it can represent Parma in Europe and in the world if we can value it as it deserves It should be remembered that together with the birthplace of Giuseppe Verdi already declared a national monument and the Teatro Magnani di Fidenza and the Teatro Giuseppe Verdi di Busseto it can aim to become an international unicum I would like to end by thanking my colleagues from the Culture Committee the President Senator Riccardo Nencini and the Senator and rapporteur Albert Laniece who have joined me in this bill and of course the Government today represented by the Undersecretary Lucia Borgonzoni I thank my colleagues who have spoken and shared with me this statement of the Teatro Regio as a national monument I am very pleased that the Assembly will vote in favour of this bill and as Parmesan I invite everyone to visit and above all to live the

#AugussoriLuigi,Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President allow me at the beginning of my speech to join in the thanks to the rapporteurs Senators Calderoli and Santangelo for the work they have done congratulations which I extend to all the members of the Junta and in particular to those of the Committee which took part in its work for the excellent positive and collaborative climate that took place during the work itself Finally Mr President we have all appreciated the wise guidance and style in which you have addressed us over the last few months knowing that you are firm if necessary but also flexible in ensuring full autonomy for the Committee so that it can operate in the most productive and profitable way possible Thank you President As we know the reform of the Senate Rules has become necessary as a result of the constitutional change that has reduced the number of senators from the next legislature to 200 It is not clear that this is the right place to make judgements about the reform but what is certain is that the many positive aspects of the reform risk being in vain if not destabilizing if it is not accompanied by a corresponding amendment to our Rules of Procedure that it cannot only be that of a proportion of the various numerical parameters but that it must also reorganize the functioning of some bodies in this branch of Parliament the standing committees on all It was decided to reduce their number to ten because the current 14 format would lead to a poor and problematic composition of each of them The necessary adjustments are based on thematic affinity criteria but also on the workloads of each of them The two filter committees 1a and 5a and 2a which are among others the most burdened by the number of acts dealt with are left unchanged For the current 3rd 4th and 14th it was preferred to leave the European policies autonomous thus bringing together foreign affairs and defence which are among those which given to the hand have to date fewer tasks Agriculture flows with productive activities territory and environment with the Commission on public works finally health with the Commission work and welfare The occasion of the revision of the Regulation was also and above all useful to do the cutting al though excellent articulated that we use daily The 2017 reform produced a slender Regulation easy to interpret which allowed our work to proceed smoothly and smoothly with clear advantage on the quality of legislative production The practical application during this parliamentary term has shown that it works well but it has also highlighted the areas where it is perfect The Junta proposes therefore some corrections in this regard and others to respond to some distortions that the political framework in continuous and dynamic evolution has produced A new body the Legislative Committee is set up drawing on the existing one in the Chamber of Deputies Article 4 provides for an interesting novelty concerning the Parliamentary Committee on Regional Affairs providing for the possibility of inviting representatives of the Regions the Autonomous Provinces and the local authorities to participate in the meetings of the Commission itself in relation to specific measures This is an important signal of attention to local realities that fits in with the irreversible and untenable action that started with the referendum on autonomy of 22 October 2017 At the same time it is envisaged that the European Union 's Political Commission may invite Members of the European Parliament to participate without the right to vote in its meetings in relation to specific measures On the other hand we are putting forward at least three important amendments to facilitate our work particularly in the Commission First of all there is greater clarity in the arrival and transposition of the amended decrees in the Commission to the House The amendments adopted will be incorporated directly into the text the so called Annex A and will no longer have to be voted on by the Assembly as Commission amendments The examination of the decrees is therefore equal to that of ordinary drafts of law with two obvious advantages Mr President

#AugussoriLuigi,"Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen undersecretary Vezzali today we are discussing at third reading the proposal to include sport as one of the values protected by our Constitution After the first two readings concluded with a large majority approval the third passage and then the fourth in the Chamber of Deputies are not a useless bureaucratic harp but a clear representation planned and wanted by the constituent Fathers useful to show that the will of Parliament is firm and convinced However the opportunity is also useful to reaffirm the thanks of politics to the world of sport for everything it puts in place to allow the growth of the sociality and well being of the entire population of the country and in particular of the new generations Our thanks must reach everyone the Italian National Olympic Committee CONI the Paralympic Committee sports federations promotion agencies tens of thousands of sports clubs valuable volunteers technicians managers judges and referees and above all athletes whether they are professionals amateurs or mere amateurs they are the protagonists of this fantastic world We recognize the educational social and promotional value of the psychophysical well being of sports activity in all its forms In doing so we recognize that sport is unequivocally a characteristic element of our society that it is present almost in every family and that it enters every day in every house if not with the sports activity exercised directly at least with the attention and passion of those who appreciate and follow a team or an athlete For children and teenagers the athlete often takes on the role of model but it must be positive and for this reason we appreciate the efforts made to promote fair play We are satisfied that the wording chosen is the one indicated by our bill using the words sport activities instead of sports gives a wider meaning which refers not only to physical expression exercised in an organized and regulated way but to every activity carried out even in an autonomous way by the individual that is put in place to gain psychophysical benefit Here I refer to the only slightly stunned aspect that we have already had the opportunity to emphasize in the past and on which therefore I do not dwell much We would have liked the amendment to be included in Article 32 which deals with health precisely to highlight the importance of sport for the purposes of psychophysical well being a fundamental element in the growth of adolescents but also for the vital maintenance of older generations without forgetting the fundamental contribution that sport brings to the world of disability especially as a channel to stimulate sociality and integration Article 33 was chosen thus giving greater emphasis to the educational aspect certainly legitimate choice being the other pillar that supports the importance of sport practice We are sure that it was not an easy choice so there is no willingness on our part to blame those colleagues who supported it Being unable to create an article 32 and a half we can debrief the fact in simple nuance in a context definitely and widely positive We also find positivity in the fact that we have remedied a gap that we had compared to many other nations which in a more far sighted way have provided for a long time Certainly it is understandable that our Constitutional Charter had not foreseen it since its birth in 1948 the constituent Fathers still had before their eyes the instrumental and functional use of the acceptance of the fascist regime of the previous two decades but to wait over seventy years to recognize the social value and popularity of the phenomenon was actually so much if not too much This is why our intention in presenting the bill was not to celebrate the valuable results of sport of excellence it is indeed a way to emphasize that Olympic medals are not achieved unless there is a model of society that starts from below protecting and promoting sport activity and practice Sport is aggregation respect for the rules fight against youth deviance and social distress it is prevention in the health field it is friendship and brotherhood it is sacrifice commitment and respect for the objectives it is finally the growth of human relations If I think of the many young people who after finishing their school hours close in their bedrooms and immerse themselves in a virtual and digital world I regret with nostalgia the fields of the oratory and the skinned knees Sport is also involvement and sharing between generations The many small clubs and sports associations born and developed in this I love to call the country of the 8,000 bell towers live and thrive thanks to the fundamental contribution of many former athletes or non-athletes who make their operation possible I think of the mothers who make hot tea the fathers who act as collective drivers the grandparents who cut the grass of the field maybe the former champion who now takes care of the stock of the material Without them this would not be possible Without them these social micro universes these real extended families could not exist and flourish To them must be addressed our work and go our thought and our thanks If we understand this if we do what we can to protect this basic reality then we will appreciate even more the moments of success of high level sport Colleagues in less than four years our mountains will host an exceptional event the Winter Olympics Milan Cortina 2026 Let 's make them the visible tip of an

#ZaffiniFrancesco,Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President we have taken part in the drafting of the new Rules of Procedure as you have been able to verify even in the restricted Committee in a spirit that is absolutely available and constructive I would also like to thank Mr Malan for having been more assiduous than I have been in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy It is clear that when we are about to correct the rules governing the operation of a branch of Parliament there can only be an approach of maximum seriousness maximum correctness and maximum objectivity and not instrumentality Well this same spirit and attitude have only been grasped sporadically in the various speeches of my colleagues representing the majority In fact this is a regulation written by that majority that at the time when the Draghi Government was still alive and therefore the concept of majority and opposition was valid considered to write an organized regulation on contingency That is what we have objected to from the very beginning The rules of operation of the Senate of the Republic in our opinion cannot be written under the influence of an absolutely original circumstance such as the one that determined the course of the past legislature by virtue of which the Chambers were dissolved a few days ago as is known The original circumstances of the course of that legislature have for example determined the hypertrophic representation of the Mixed Group here as well as in the Chamber Those circumstances were particular and original I repeat do we want to say that they were motivated a little also from the result of 2018 Are we to say that this Parliament was from the outset placed under a shadow represented by the fact that a large part of its representatives were precisely members of the party that someone called run away from home not me but someone else Rules must be written to prevent this from happening again It does not seem useful for example to predict the economic damage to the workings of the Groups when there are changes from one Group to another when we know that the financial allocations of the Groups are obviously not benefits ad personam but they are resources necessary to ensure the functioning of the Groups even more so when about 30 of the Senators will fail with the implementation of the reform of the reduction in the number of Members On the contrary therefore the resources if anything at a time when the groups will have to cope with legislative and secretariat work for example and with the increased work required of senators and Members were to be increased Another circumstance that does not convince us at all as Senator Malan has explained perfectly in his statement and in the request for the secret vote is this bringing back to a political logic the functioning of the Council for the authorizations as we imagine it will give rise to many messes that will then reverberate as the colleague has rightly said not so much on the prerogatives of the senators and not on the so called privileges told with journalistic abbreviation by observers a little too inattentive but on prerogatives of the Senate to ensure an objective and objective operation In all these circumstances Mr President which we have also discussed extensively in the debate on the functioning of the Junta we shall abstain from voting on Rule 1 and then we shall see how we can vote on the subsequent articles,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,2.2038434,-13.216864,7,mr zaffini fdi mr

#ZaffiniFrancesco,Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President with the measure under consideration Parliament the Government and the State are doing a sort of due act that is they are actually celebrating a technical mechanical occasion so to speak the anniversary of the eight centuries since the death of Francesco d'Assisi which took place on 3 October 1226 Mr President I imagine however that in the idea of all of us this celebration comes out on the exquisitely celebrative side to embrace what we actually celebrate namely a system of values that over time the figure of Francis represented and materialized All this in a city in a territory in a region and in a nation such as Italy of which Francis is patron evidently unanimously recognized who live this reality and try to transfer it and pass it on I come from Umbria and have lived for a few years in Assisi colleagues I can testify to you that in fact in those places you can breathe what John Paul II called the spirit of Assisi now it is really complicated to describe how to act in order to succeed in materializing it in the use of the resources made available The objective is to find a link even at a celebratory moment between a due act which we obviously approve and appreciate and advance that we will vote in favour achieved by the Government and the State with respect to the need to make available organizational and economic and financial structures to celebrate worthily over several years the very important anniversary and a system of values that more than ever before is absolutely indispensable to absorb transfer pass on and receive fully in everyday life in the government of the States and the destinies of the communities that are recognized in the States for example today of Europe it is a truly difficult and difficult undertaking which remains at the head of this committee on which we recommend and ask for the utmost attention Mr President because it will have the difficult task of leaving an empty celebration of the eight centuries of recurrence from the death of the saint in order to enter instead into a logic of preservation and transfer of indispensable values in this historical moment more than ever more than ever It is not obvious that this will happen colleagues Not because of controversy I remember and I quote a passage here is my colleague Modena who lived as protagonist that season when I was regional councillor of the Umbria Region we wrote a re-edition of the regional statute which is a sort of constitution of the regional community of Umbria I repeat that I remember it not because of polemic vis but only to help understand the difficulty of transferring these values in an absolutely shared way well we failed to indicate in article 1 of the status of the Region those represented by Francis and Benedict as founding values of the regional community of Umbria We could n't We were in opposition and the majority of the time identified Capitini as the one who embodied the values of peace that the city of Assisi but also the whole regional community obviously share in an absolutely widespread way Well I repeat that I do not say this because of controversy today the new statute of Umbria in the elaboration phase will contain that quote I believe that this is absolutely necessary and indispensable because symbols rhetorical figures images stories and traditions must be quoted handed down known and represented to the younger generations to those who come after If the figure of Francis and the values he represented which have exploded in their importance over the centuries today rise to this importance it is precisely because we must be able to transfer them into the shared absolutely outside the dynamics of partisan political discussions I hope that all of this will succeed in doing so in this committee to which an organizational programme a system of events and the need to take decisions and measures using resources which as far as I am concerned seem appropriate and which will be useful for taking action on these sides You know colleagues to give you a figure where the word Italy appears for the first time in Italian art In the upper basilica of Assisi in the frescoes of Cimabue Giotto Simone Martini and Cimabue pass these values in a visual and plastic way in the same way I believe that with different instruments and with different logics this committee should do so to which we will obviously pay great attention in controlling what happens and in directing its activity The Government 's recommendation to provide a great deal of attention to its formation avoiding that it can represent a simple means of sharing tasks however unpaid even if important and making it an opportunity instead to contribute in a widely shared way to the formulation of a program of events that can give meaning to the recurrence Good job,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,2.5503852,-4.7699275,7,mr zaffini fdi mr president measure

#LaPietraPatrizioGiacomo,THE PIETRA FdI Mr President Members of the Government ladies and gentlemen I cannot hide the satisfaction of the debate today in this House of a draft law at my first signature which concerns a demonstration strongly linked to the territory for which I also have the honour to speak in an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group we are talking about the amendment to Article 2 of Law No 238 of 20 December 2012 for the support and enhancement of the Pistoia Blues Festival I would like to express satisfaction and gratitude to the entire 7th Senate Commission for its sensitivity in addressing this issue which certainly opens up further reflection on the countless events that constitute a huge national cultural and musical heritage and that if put on the net can represent a huge flywheel not only cultural but also economic and employment and a further source of development for each individual territory Allow me to thank my colleagues Mr Iannone and Mr Barbaro who have done an excellent job even in an amending phase in order to support the process of the bill I would also like to thank the rapporteur Senator Cangini who with sensitivity and an institutional sense managed the work of the Commission and also a special thanks to the President of the Commission Senator Nencini who took the bill to heart so much that he wanted to sign it in turn demonstrating the importance of an event that with its forty years of activity has not only national value but also international value for the musical quality it expresses Last but not least I would like to thank my fellow senators who have signed the bill with me from my colleague Iannone to Senator Bishops from Senator Masini to Undersecretary Bini to Senator Ferrara and last but not least to my colleagues Mallegni and Floris who also added their signature to the measure demonstrating the political transversality that supported this initiative I would also like to point out that at this particularly difficult time it is important to pay attention also to seemingly more marginal aspects but they represent instead a signal of normality and attention to a world that can indeed it is be a tool of communication between peoples The Pistoia Blues Festival was founded in 1980 and its forty year long parable has led him to be the most important blues festival in Europe and one of the first in the world From the first edition to today it has represented a point of reference for the great international artists in Italy combining quality and musical research with the specificity of the territory and in particular the landscape and the typical tourist reception of the Tuscany Region of which to date is the music festival with the longest and most significant history From the first edition to today the main aims of this event have always been two to promote the territory Pistoia Tuscany and Italy as an ideal location for great international music to promote blues music as an extraordinary cultural heritage which has generated in its ramifications and developments all contemporary music The Pistoia Blues has been characterized so far by an extraordinary continuity as I said that has made it for forty years leading protagonist in the national panorama of festivals All editions have presented star casts and over the years nothing has been lost compared to its national and international standing thus remaining a reference point for the public for the press for the established artists and for the emerging ones The festival has therefore promoted for forty years without interruption the territory tourism and the Italian lifestyle through concerts and meetings all connected to the world of blues but above all through its direct language and rich in humanity which recalls values such as respect brotherhood and coexistence Never as important as this message is now In addition to this it is important to point out that Pistoia Blues carries out training and scouting activities aimed at young generations of artists For this purpose in fact it was born at the beginning of the nineties Goal BluesIn in which are selected every year the emerging musicians who will participate in the next edition of Pistoia Blues It represents a prestigious goal for many musicians who want to make their passion and talent a profession Goal BluesIn was born in 1993 alongside the event therefore to enhance the new Italian talents in the music field and is one of the stable and priority activities of the event with free registration it counts every year between 500 and 600 admissions and chooses the winners who will play on the main stage of the festival one for each geographical area of Italy Centro South and North through live selections that take place in the network of local members of the initiative Participating in the Pistoia Blues with Goal BluesIn is a real showcase that in addition to offering the opportunity to play on a prestigious stage in front of a large audience presents the winning artists to a selected representation of organizers and operators of the Italian and European music sector guests of the festival The winners of the BluesIn Objective also have the opportunity to be included in the compilation dedicated to the Pistoia Blues Generation Festival There is therefore a special focus on young people It is a real snapshot of new rock and blues talents of the Italian scene with a selection of the best and most representative bands that have participated in the competition of recent years an opportunity I repeat unrepeatable for young people This legislative measure I shall conclude Mr President means making a further qualitative leap in the organizational arrangements and consolidating the event aimed at achieving a renewed capacity for planning and prospects on the one hand it enhances the historical and cultural heritage that the festival has represented on the other hand it allows the event to extend its activities and to involve other players in the national and international context to enhance the experience and to expand the promotional activities It represents an acknowledgment not only to a great event but to an entire community that in forty years has narrowed itself around it becoming a whole one during not only the days of July but all the year round when the whole city becomes a great stage with its squares its alleys of the historic center and the many locals that welcome the artists allowing an atmosphere to breathe thanks to the many initiatives that involve everyone For these reasons and for many others that time does not allow me to explain in detail I declare the positive and convinced vote of the Brothers of Italy Group and my personal satisfaction I thank the Senate

Defence Commission his friend and colleague Massimo Candura for the patience and mediation capacity he has found with all the members of the Defence Commission Dear colleagues the measure that we will shortly vote I hope unanimously is a source of great emotion for me not only because by fatality we are discussing it on the 150th anniversary of the birth of the Alpine Corps but also because it anticipates the 93rd event of the National Alpine Association ANA in Rimini by an exact month I believe that with the vote in favour of this House the more than 200,000 alpine people who are going to do so on 8 May will do so even more head to head and proud of the institutions For a senator and a mountaineer like me raised on bread and alpine this is an unforgettable day I have the great fortune not only to be a descendant of an alpine family but above all to be part of the great Alpine family which I have been very close to since the age of nine when my grandfather involved me in the social activities of the alpine group of my country Montefiorino I am so attached to this Corps that I still feel sorry for not being judged fit for military service As a partner ANA a friend of the Alps however I have never been burdened and proudly when possible cross referenced with my group While my appeal was still pending on the Senate I asked Modena deputy Golinelli whom I thank to present to the House this bill then approved there unanimously in June 2019 I must say that it was not easy to identify the two important words that grasped its meaning memory and sacrifice We talk about memory because it is a specialty of the Alpines with territorial recruitment which immediately became the pride of the mountain people and the valleyrs who fed it with their best youth The Alpines have not forgotten this when they returned home from military service and have always maintained that bond of friendship and fraternity with the comrades For this reason in almost every village and fraction of our Alpine and Apennine valleys stands an ANA headquarters where the former conscripts were able to continue to remain at the service of their community Then there is the word sacrifice which is the thing that the Alpines since their foundation have always known and respected without fear Those who live in the mountains and in the inland areas know well what it is even in the common life even today from agriculture to school from road to communications The alpine sacrifice has proved it in all the wars in which they participated but they have demonstrated it even more in all the activities of volunteering and civil protection in which they are worthy of admiration We now come to the date of the celebration on January 26 of each year the unfortunate date although it was that of a battle at Nikolajewka is the synthesis of what are the words memory and sacrifice that is the spirit of fraternity On January 26 1943 the now exhausted Alpine troops of the Tridentina division and the disbanded Alpines of the Julia and Cuneense divisions found themselves in front of the Russian barrier of Nikolajewka These troops had been surrounded and then sacrificed a month earlier on the banks of the Don to allow the withdrawal of what remained of the Armir but also of Germans Romanians and Hungarians overwhelmed by Operation Piccolo Saturn At the time of the retreat order the alpines still counted 52,000 actual men who though surrounded and without hope had held the positions assigned to them until that fateful January 17 1943 when they began their terrible advance backwards which lasted nine days with twenty five battles of breakout and rearguard By opening the way the Tridentina division thanks also to the sacrifice of the sister divisions Julia and Cuneense transformed the retreat into the most unstoppable and tragic advance in enemy territory that has ever been seen In inhuman conditions due to lack of food and shelter with very little ammunition without means of transport if not sleds attached to the faithful mules with temperatures of 40 degrees below zero the alpines saved their lives to themselves and to a mass of Italian German Romanian and Hungarian prisoners released and aggregated in the long column If these Alpines had no memory of their distant homes their families and their country they would not have found the necessary strength if they had not had a spirit of sacrifice the wounded would not have put themselves on their shoulders they would not have divided the little food left with all the sloppers who sat down to the long column and could not have shown themselves to the fatal clash of Nikolajewka which allowed 13,240 men to come out of the bag Mario Rigoni Stern wrote pages that I believe all of us have had the opportunity to appreciate in which we read the despair but at the same time also the humanity of that January 26 Alpini rescued by a companion officers who die at the head of their men waiters who stop to weep them they are just some of the episodes of that tragic battle of Nikolajevka which culminates in the scene of General Reverberi commander of the Tridentina who climbed on the last remaining semountant leads the crucial battle and personally guides the survivors to the assault Let me read the poem of Lieutenant Nelson Cenci of the 2nd Alpine Artillery Regiment Vicenza A sunrise that had hope in the soul of the sun For vast pastures of snow under a death plowing sky on your bumps the audacity to seek life was worn out several times Only at the end of the day with desperate cry epic host of ghosts passed through half a murmur of prayers Now the sun goes down on the top of the ridge bathing with light your dead and in a wind of clouds your lonely weeping to distant heavens flees No more harsh lands and mountain profiles in their glass eyes but long mute rows of men on ice trails The track is made of stars and moon crystals turn off on miserable unnamed crosses The tragic epic of the Alpine Corps however does not end that evening on January 26 1943 but only when the survivors always reach Shebekino on foot on January 31 On February 3 the day of San Biagio on the radio Benito Mussolini announces that only 10,000 Alpines have come out of the bag and February 8 the statement n. 630 of the Red Army declares that only the Alpine Corps must be considered unbeaten in the land of Russia On March 6 1943 the translations that brought the survivors of the Alpine Corps back to Italy began from Gomel on the 15th the last convoy left and on March 24 all were in the Homeland As the friend and colleague Senator Gasparri already recalled the numbers were inclement only 6,400 of the Tridentine 3,300 of the Julia and 1,300 of the Cuneense saved and came out of the bag The tragic retreat of Russia ended mockingly for the alpine people when they returned to their homeland Few know this but at the station in Merano where they expected to be received as heroes by the same bands that with great ceremony had greeted them the year before the departure the local authorities had the anti-aircraft alarm sounded because it was better that the population did not see the pitiful state of the veterans frozen mutilated wounded without shoes and with the uniforms to shreds This however is now history the one that the veterans told the new levers in the ANA locations of our valleys together with that art of arranging that a bit distinguishes us mountainers And in the same places where the last veterans of the Great War were venerated by the veterans of the Second we younger ones learned what the great alpine family was the one that never leaves anyone behind and takes off the sled a box of ammunition and loads a wounded man In these locations in addition to the unmissable books by Mario Rigoni Stern and Giulio Bedeschi there are always hundreds of photographs that testify to that tragic retreat Today alongside the men and women in service in the Alpine Corps the hundreds of thousands of black pens have been on leave for a century now making the National Alpine Association with its 350,000 members the largest gun association in the country a living and vital presence where the ANA offices are places of aggregation Even today with emotion I think of the inclusion sign that stands at the entrance of the headquarters of the group ANA of Montefiorino Suppose and aim this light that leads you here among us Whether bourgeois or alpine you will find bread and wine It is clear therefore that from the Alpine headquarters to that of Civil Protection the passage is short and this also explains the great participation that the Alpines have as volunteers in peacetime The Alpine spirit is that of the National Alpine Association which has a motto To remember and celebrate our dead we help the living I also remember that the National Alpine Association carries out volunteering and civil protection activities throughout the country I 'm gonna finish With great sacrifice and self denial they were the most present of the State to the great disasters of the post war period To name a few from the Messina earthquake to the Friuli earthquake from the Irpinia earthquake to those of Emilia L'Aquila and Central Italy from the Flood of Florence to that of Alexandria and Valtellina without forgetting the Vajont disaster And how to forget about the setting up of the Bergamo field hospital at record times to deal with the Covid epidemic However the Alps are also present with gestures of peace such as the construction of the Sorriso kindergarten of Rossosch already seat of the Command of the Alpine Corps in the land of Russia and the construction in Brescia of the structure donated to a social cooperative of activities in favour of people with severe motor disabilities Inside there is a plaque on which it is written On the 40th anniversary of the battle of Nikolajewka in the memory of those without hatred but without vileness fell fighting for the honor of the flag and the salvation of the brothers the alpine have built this school of crafts with love and joy because to those who less have had by fate it opens a more serene future Here these are in a time of peace the crosses to the value deserved by the alpines all synthesis of memory and sacrifice as well as the institution of this Day which I believe deserve in full title In declaring the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione I would like to thank the alpine of today and tomorrow for what they do and still do I would also like to remind and thank all the Alpines of every generation who have gone forward and in particular two of them the Alpine artillery of the Val Camonica Aldo Corti group my grandfather if that January 26 had not been among those

#PellegriniEmanuele,PELLEGRINI Emanuele L SP PSd Az Mr President I will try to be brief I had prepared a speech cloth but after listening to Senator Renzi I will probably have to make some detours For today 's vote we must start with a preliminary part In other words we must understand as senators of the Republic that the question of species concerning Senator Renzi in reality should not concern Senator Renzi must concern something much wider It is precisely the constitutional appeal that I appreciated in your speech We are here to protect this Constitution I can therefore appreciate the content and passages of your speech Above all it must be clear in the heart of each of us that this premise does not look at the specific case or the preconceptions or prejudices that probably some of us some of us within this Senate may have towards the individual person or the individual parliamentarians We must have it clear in our heads because it is the only way we can get a serious vote I believe however that this premise must be remembered today as we probably should have done in other votes that have seen the Senate express itself The reference to President Berlusconi as Senator Modena has done is obvious but I cannot fail to recall the example of Senator Salvini Even then in fact we have seen how the name and surname of a senator can change the vote of an Assembly It 's ugly to say but unfortunately it is and we 've seen it before That was the premise Let us now talk about Article 68 of the Constitution All colleagues have recalled the principles underlying Article 68 of the Constitution They are principles of guaranteeing the powers of the Chambers and of the judicial authority which seek to eliminate mutual interference This is stated by the Constitution and not by a Member of the Republic or a Parliamentary Group that is the rule that states it I would also like to remind you that this constitutional rule which is the foundation of the legal order protects not the individual Member and this is probably something we should remind someone who has exploited it but the Parliamentary Assembly and this is a much wider interest than that of the individual Member of Parliament We maintain the functionality of Parliament the integrity of its composition and decision making autonomy If we delete one of these three it makes no sense to sit in this House anymore We must support this rule because it is the basis for democratic freedom We represent democratic freedom here and the House represents it because we are an expression of a vote of a people the people voted for us they sent us here and we must represent it However I repeat that in order to represent it to exercise its legislative function worthily and freely we must always respect the Constitution but we must all do so we first but also all the powers of the State starting with the main ones If we really want to comply fully with the constitutional rule we must remember that its implementation must be full and respectful of all powers On this I listened to Senator Parrini say that we must not throw the issue of course synthesize into the usual debate between politics and the judiciary I am among those who continue to argue that the freedom and independence of the judiciary must be protected but also the freedom and independence of politics must be protected because if we do not guarantee them we do not guarantee the balance of the State Let us remember that our Constitution is based on precise balances and that it has been written after a bad period of our history from which we have learned many things We must therefore maintain those balances It is not enough to continue to seek easy consensus with anti-politics as someone still insists on doing We need true politics the one that has characterized our history and also the movement to which I belong because we have always looked at our base we have always listened to people This has always characterized us and must continue to characterize us We cannot allow the surrender or reinterpretation of constitutional rules to make politics more childish because it is easier to tell Politics is a very difficult art and precisely for this reason we must be particularly careful and careful when taking such decisions Senator Renzi could be told a lot Some of his expressions I honestly tell him I did not particularly appreciate them But democracy is of course beautiful for this very reason we cannot agree on everything and we must not agree on everything But let us always remember the words that have been said such as for example that the veil of the proxy is worth more than a sentence Let 's always remember this even when there may be some wild attacks because a warning of guarantee is enough to put a person on the cross I quote only for contemporaneity the fact that today has arrived the filing to the president of the Lombardy Fontana Region which was crucified for a warranty notice Let us always remember it when there will be other passages of Junta because obviously there will be passages of Junta Let us try to reason on the merits of things and constitutional rules because if we do not respect them politics goes away to get fried excuse the term and we agree with those who do anti-politics On the contrary here we must make the real policy and return to the beautiful episodes of politics such as those that were there just now when we unanimously approved a bill with absolutely meritorious content Let us try to find that content of true politics and avoid using the votes of Junta as has been done in the past Let us remember this for the future let it remain in the acts and let there be memory of this thing In recalling all this in order to ensure that all those who have spoken these words today remember them also tomorrow I announce the Lega Salvini Premier Group 's vote in favour of the rapporteur 's report with the premises that I have made it is not a vote in favour of Senator Renzi but it is a vote in favour of respecting the constitutional rules and democratic freedom of this country,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#RipamontiPaolo,RIPAMONTI rapporteur I 'm confident Mr Collina gave a fair description of the course of this measure which is coming to this House today I would instead like to start with sincere and heartfelt thanks first of all to the Government represented I say this for the part that has not participated actively in our work then the Minister D'Incà especially by Deputy Minister Pichetto Fratin and by the Undersecretary Bini who in recent months alongside each other have given a great boost to an important job perhaps underestimated that Parliament and this majority have carried out for a measure that someone has defined as the most important of the whole legislature It should not be forgotten how important this bill is for the continuation of our path within the PNRR Allow me to thank my group leader Massimiliano Romeo for the confidence he has shown me in allowing me to follow this measure within my Commission and President Girotto whom I particularly thank for the balance he has always shown over the past few months trying to find a path that combined two political forces a little distant such as the League and the PD in the representation of the rapporteurs but also all the majority forces He has always done so with great balance so I thank him I would also like to thank my Parent Company in the Commission Roberto Marti who has been enormously useful to me and all my colleagues from the 10th The Commission together with colleagues in the House who have spoken from time to time has shown a great sense of responsibility depending on the article we are talking about and has never shirked away from the Commission 's work I would like to thank Dr Di Caesar very much I want to do so too without whom it was difficult honestly to come out of this mechanism perhaps a little new at least for me it certainly is of a measure made with two thousand hands between the House and the Senate Thank you so much The last thanks and then move on to some consideration I address it to my co-rapporteur because in the end we have shown that sometimes you can also be distant from the point of view of the balance of politics but you can be much closer when the substance prevails So thanks to Senator Collina for the great work and thanks to all the Leaders here I see Senator De Petris Senator Malpezzi Senator Castellone Senator Faraone In the end they brought us back when it was time to do so to concreteness This bill is fundamental for the PNRR as Senator Collina has very well reminded us and in the report that we are going to deliver to Parliament it is very well described how important it is and how much work has been done a huge amount of work carried out together with the House and I assure you that it has not been very simple because political positions are different and sometimes within the political group itself there are different opinions I speak for my own not for others in order to avoid controversy I believe there has been a non-coherent narrative or rather in recent times a message has emerged not so consistent with the true work of the whole Parliament the whole Senate and the House but above all not consistent with the efforts of the two rapporteurs and representatives of the Government who have very much applied themselves to this measure perhaps leading it in the end to a single subject that of the last days relating to bathing concessions On the other hand within this bill there is a world that has been set up and that has been put in a position to obtain the necessary and binding funds provided for in the contracts we have signed with Europe And alive God for once we sign the contracts and respect them We have solved of the important points like the hydropower the tied part to the portualità the tied part to the derivation of the gas and the tied part to the in house changing also a little that perhaps was a wrong approach regarding a great topic like that of the house to the great ability of the territories to make system between them Therefore we tried to protect this aspect while remaining within the perimeter of the competition that was called up I do not extend my speech too long because the general debate will involve many speeches and I do not want to take away from colleagues who will intervene in the strength and desire to claim within this bill their belongings Therefore I just congratulate everyone and say that in my opinion this bill was an important demonstration of how we can work and work well reserving for reply because otherwise it would not be me some pebbles

#RipamontiPaolo,RIPAMONTI L SP PSd Az Madam President this is my first explanation of vote in four and a half years I am doing it at the end of my term and it is a strange and a little anomalous I must say that I am also a little excited that in order to avoid making bad figures at the end I am now announcing my Group 's vote in favour of this measure I would like to take this opportunity once again after having done so at first reading to thank the Commission Mr Girotto who wisely conducted its work Mr Pichetto Fratin who with as much wisdom and also with firmness had the opportunity and the ability to keep us at bay the Undersecretary Bini who with patience kept the barefoot who had put their hands to this measure at bay Finally I would like to thank but not least my co-rapporteur Senator Collina with whom we are honored to have brought to conclusion the provision in the Senate in a not simple and even unusual way As Senator Collina recalled during his report in fact the measure will not see the light with the vote of confidence but through a great process of confrontation within the Groups on a fundamental issue as well as directly for the PNRR which is that of competition The adoption of this draft law is a fundamental act for this legislature and the PNRR tranche As I am in the pre-election period I have a reflection in the following terms The term responsibility is evoked very often even during the crisis of government there were difficulties and everyone said that we had to be responsible and that we had to translate this responsibility into measures so if Parliament had by chance decided to put an end to a moment of community and to go towards the elections because we would have run the risk of not approving the measures Some would say that it was a bit of a path like that of the game Ciapa not the responsibility is yours that you make it fall no it 's mine no it 's that other one's What has happened has happened at last the voters will have the opportunity to make their contribution and decide the next government It is certain that the responsibility of this Parliament has never been challenged because today we are approving the draft competition law We therefore also reject the whole narration that Parliament is made of washing That 's not true we 've taken on our responsibility we 'll continue to work all week we 'll come to the Senate when it 's time to do it because there 's still so much to do Therefore beyond the fact that the elections were held on 25 September this Parliament continues to work and I am very proud to be a member of it Changes have been made in relation to the text approved by the Senate at first reading amendments we hold on to and on which we have worked As my colleague Errani mentioned earlier we have done a great job on the part to me very dear linked to the 'in house of the audience we have reversed the concept for which it was said that everything that is in house is not wrong and that everything that is private is not fair In some way we protect all our communities of mayors and administrators who together have found the synthesis even when they were not together from the political point of view yet have had the ability to form societies that manage our territories well During the examination in the Chamber the fundamental theme was that of taxis which was deleted and I believe that a good job was done He has n't brought a country to its knees and I 'd like to use a term without being accused of saying the wrong things The draft competition law has tried a little to force the hand on some issues including taxis and I must say that without Damocles sword of a ruling of the Council of State on the back Parliament has found its synthesis and made an absolutely conscious choice that is to exclude an issue that from the beginning from the first meetings we held at Palazzo Chigi all the Groups no one excluded had posed as problematic I have to say that there has been an issue that has created some embarrassment in the world of credit mediation and real estate agencies that of incompatibility between the two systems which has never been in question Some time ago a change was made that fortunately in the Chamber through the amendments to the draft competition law submitted by Forza Italia the League and other groups was put in place so incompatibility has failed I also thank all those associations that took charge of being spokesperson first of all the Italian Federation of Professional Real Estate Agents FIAIP which created the conditions for there to be a minimum of responsibility and awareness I do not want to use all the time also because the session is almost over and so I would end with a topic that is very dear to me that of bathing I know that this is an issue that has not been touched on in this branch of Parliament but perhaps a minimum of narrative or rather narrative which brings everything back to a proper dimension must be done There was a law No. 145 of 2018 done well and negotiated with Europe which had the need like today 's competition law to be grounded with the implementing decrees The Count I Government has fallen we do not enter into the merit of why it has fallen although history has said that perhaps it was good to do so and the Count II Government has not closed the implementing decrees So I would have the pleasure to hear once in a while even on the political side that is dearest to me that of center right not only an accusation against those who today as I will say later have secured a section but also against those who have not put down Law No. 145 of 2018 which has a name and a surname and is called Dario Franceschini who was Minister of Tourism I do n't know if the perfect storm was created because then things happened in a rather abnormal way almost as if there were a great director behind it Dario Franceschini did not put down the implementing decrees Europe was mocked rightly because we said things and we did others and at that point when politics does not do things someone else always comes and does them Thus came a decision of the Council of State that said be patient what you have done is not good I disapply Law No 145 and by 31 June 2023 you must go to public evidence Right or wrong political or non-political high or low lean or fat is irrelevant this was the Maginot line we were supposed to be in It is about the sense of responsibility because whether you govern like it or not and leave us blood when you govern in situations like those in which we governed you have to be responsible The sense of responsibility leads you to recognize to the full the cards and rules with which you are playing at that time and the decision of the Council of State is there When someone says I do n't care because we do n't have to go there but we have to go and do this or that I Paolo Ripamonti who grew up on the beach who have friends who do this job and I have people who write to me every day and who insult me a little every day telling me that finally since there are elections on September 25 the package is over I say I am proud to have voted on an amendment that has secured them To posterity the arduous sentence because until proven otherwise until 2024 since the mayors find the strength to do what they had asked so we are not ready to make the auctions we are not ready to make the evidence and ask for an extension in some way are in safety because there are the compensations and there are the rewards These are all things that someone does n't want to see but beyond that because we will be great and win the election and because the coalition will form and at that moment we will all be there and we will all be responsible we will do a great job and all together looking in our eyes we will say this can be done and this can not be done And God we 're all gonna make a decision together,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#FregolentSonia,Mr President I should like to thank the rapporteurs Senators Ripamonti and Collina for the great work they have done over the last few months and together with them all the members of the 10th Commission and the various committees which have followed each other and have made their contribution to improving the competition measure Deputy Minister Pichetto and Undersecretary Bini who are always available for a constant and constructive dialogue with the parliamentarians a measure that is improved after the work carried out in the Senate Having seen the work of the last few months I cannot fail to reflect on the separation of powers in our system and in particular on the role of Parliament which is increasingly limited to merely ratifying decisions taken by the Government which should instead be the executive body of decisions taken in parliamentary bodies Certainly the pandemic before and the war now did not help but it had become customary also in the previous legislatures to see an occupation of spaces by the various governments on purely legislative competences on issues that must be dealt with in the parliamentary classrooms by those who are elected by the Italian citizens and represent them If Parliament finds improvements to the text proposed by the Commission we should all work in the same direction The measure in our examination is fundamental to the obtaining of the funds of the PNRR and also to avoid that infringement procedures are initiated against our country It is absolutely necessary however to understand where the balance lies between the interests of Europe and those of Italy because sometimes they are conflicting and a simple flattening on Europeanistic positions does not mean doing the interests of our fellow citizens Ladies and gentlemen we are frank and aware without a reform of the public administration for the simplification of procedures and the deburocratization we will not go anywhere a public administration often oriented towards maintaining its status quo which relieves and dumps on citizens all kinds of burdens and responsibilities almost forgetting that those who choose to work in this area should have as I do the interest of citizens rather than become the office complications simple business Without this reform the valuable work done with this bill will also be watered down In addition to the subject of bathing concessions which has been raised more to the news local public services energy waste transport and health care are among the measures addressed The Members who preceded me and those who will follow will enter into detail and substance of the various issues Personally however I propose a reflection on the companies in house to remember how often the municipalities have often constituted these companies because the market did not offer solutions and it is not or was not economical Just think of the services that connect morphologically difficult territories to reach Parliament 's work has also taken account of these aspects The last thought goes to the great work done on the issues of health where we have tried to find a balance starting from the fundamental need to ensure effective appropriate and safe treatment routes especially in cases of particularly serious and disabling diseases Monitoring and control of all facilities providing health services is essential to ensure the quality of services fair access and eliminate opacity where health services are provided with public finance charges A very important work has been carried out on equivalent drugs to make them readily available while respecting intellectual property rights Research must continue fully in the interests of all Finally starting with the conclusion the Italian blood collection system is an example of excellence worldwide and with the changes introduced the concept of free and voluntary donation is confirmed In these months an important and complex work has been produced in the interest of Italians,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,4.7548904,-9.795547,7,mr president like thank rapporteurs senators ripamonti collina great work done last

#PetrengaGiovanna,PETRENGA FdI Mr President today we are debating the adoption of an important bill which should not be underestimated even if Article 3 of the Code of Cultural Heritage already provides when it is declared a good of cultural interest that the wording of a national monument is implicit In any case as long as we take care of the valorization of our cultural heritage it is always pleasurable Brothers of Italy has submitted several proposals which are in the acts of the Senate to enhance our heritage to which no response has yet been given despite repeated reminders Coming to today 's bill we accept with pleasure the recognition given because the Arch of Traiano is a monument recognized over the centuries which has attracted so much attention from experts scholars and illustrious visitors so much so that in 1750 King Charles of Bourbon visiting the city of Benevento in front of the Arch of Traiano remained ecstatic to the point of commissioning a canvas to Antonio Ioli an important 18th century viewer to make a painting today preserved in the Royal Palace of Caserta Over the years the Arch of Traiano has undergone several bombings and earthquakes and has always been restored even if with techniques of the time before there was no Charter of Restoration and only consolidation operations were carried out The various restoration works that affected the Arch of Traiano were carried out by the Superintendence to the monuments of Naples and subsequently by the Superintendence of Caserta The Superintendence of Caserta carried out a significant restoration thanks to a project approved with Lotto funds in two phases the first concerned consolidation while the second the restoration of sculptural decorations On that occasion a scaffolding was built to allow the visit to the Arc also with the restoration work in progress In agreement with the municipality was also set up in the nearby Church of Sant 'Ilario an exhibition with panels and audiovisual media that was very successful Therefore it has never been neglected also because the duty of the citizen and the agencies in charge is to enhance and preserve the inherited goods which we have the task of protecting in order to pass them on It is important yes to preserve and protect but after this stage the most important step must come namely the enhancement In the measure I read without commitment of expenditure My point is not to be controversial It is a matter of working with the resources already allocated to the agencies in charge but the Ministry knows very well that the agencies of protection are now in the luminicino There are no funds and therefore more substantial spending commitments are needed to enhance and create promotional pathways I am thinking for example of twinnings with other territories where similar arches are located of the inclusion in international tourist itineraries and of the involvement of individuals to make the Arch of Trajan a great attractor If this were to be achieved we would really have taken a step forward in favour of the territory where the monument insists which is subject to constraints The Superintendence for example has repeatedly invited the mayor to reduce traffic volumes in the street where the monument insists to prevent smog from damaging it There are limits therefore but we must also create advantages making productive for the benefit of the territory the cultural good which must be a call and become the so called great attractor I hope that from tomorrow after the adoption of this measure this path will begin Brothers of Italy is willing to cooperate and I hope that I can see this project realized As far as we are concerned today 's measure must be a starting point and not a point of arrival I therefore announce the vote in favour of the Brothers of Italy Group,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,-0.12363359,-2.8445776,7,petrenga fdi mr president
