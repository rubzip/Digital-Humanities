#MireiaBorrásPabón,Thank you President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Good morning minister Today we discuss the budgets for 2023 of the Ministry of Science and Innovation in a country where only the consumption of Jabugo ham in Moncloa is higher than the average salary of a researcher in Spain These are budgets in which you Minister say to prioritize science but the only thing that you prioritize is your ideology your globalist agenda and of course you yourself with millionaire items in institutional advertising The Government of Spain had never spent so much or so badly The budgets that Spain needs must include a high courageous and transformative percentage of investment in science and innovation with a rationalization of expenditure taking into account not only how much but above all how in order for real budgetary policies to improve the working conditions of scientists to reduce bureaucracy to increase flexibility and agility in the management of public research bodies to retain and attract real talent if we compare with wages in an international context and to boost a growing investment in R D+ i Did we get it from these budgets The answer is no Firstly because of the current macroeconomic context The very high inflation we suffer is actually causing the funds available for science and innovation to be even at risk of being lower than the previous year and this does not say VOX this has been denounced by the Confederation of Scientific Societies of Spain minister Without going any further do you know the huge increase in costs that you are putting on research centres and universities simply paying off energy bills Triplicated costs that you have to deduct of course from the budget that you allocate to research a situation that further precariouss your activity and that you have caused minister so less blows to the chest Secondly because of your constant attacks on tax deductions on R D+i because you and the Minister of Finance are not clear as to the bases of deduction putting at risk not only our legal certainty but the 3.5 billion euros per year of investment in R D+i that Spain needs so much Thirdly because one third of the funds of this ministry are European funds that have an expiry date until 2024 And then what What will happen when they are not or worse if you fail to execute them as we already see happening Today only 5 of the Parties have been resolved a small 5 of the total in all these months which makes it impossible to allocate all the necessary investments in time These budgets should be designed to replace in the coming years all this money from European funds in funds of national origin and what is contained in these spending policies is simply contrary to this path How are we going to increase national funds in research and innovation if most of them have to come from the private sector as is already the case in Germany and the UK and you are working to sabotage our main instrument to encourage research and development which are these tax deductions to R D+i that I am commenting on If we add to all this the almost chronic problem that these budgets do not solve which is the low percentage of financial funds that are being implemented which do not reach half we can conclude that these budgets are not by far in line with the objectives that we must set ourselves for the policies of science and innovation in Spain If that were not enough these general budgets of the State as a whole intoxicate everything they touch with their ideology and sectarianism and in this case unfortunately also science They intend to include their sick gender dimension in research through initiatives such as the creation of a gender equality badge in R D+i for the centres or the creation of chiringuitos that by the way deprive researchers such as the Women Science and Innovation Observatory the unity of equality or the unity of women and science and not only that but also seek to impose scientific and technological vocations on girls and young women Yes I say impose and in this sense I would like to ask you the following do you know the Nordic paradox Minister I think I 've told him before This study shows that in more developed countries with a higher degree of gender equality such as Nordics women tend to choose less often to work or study in the fields of science technology engineering or mathematics Do you know why minister Because there is a greater quality of life and freedom in welfare States and therefore the academic strengths and personal interests of women prevail In other words their obsessive sectarianism over diversity does not prevail over freedom or meritocracy On the other hand the participation of the female labour force in mining is 7.5 compared to 92.5 of men Do n't you want equity there minister Why do n't I see mining women 's development workshops or support for women 's development in mining Minister Why not Let women choose in peace Finally but not least I would like to stress the missed opportunity of these budgets to co-ordinate and reduce territorial inequalities in R D I especially in rural Spain bearing in mind that investment of this kind is a key indicator for the development of the regions We know that this government shows a strange preference for favouring criminals from beatings and bildutars to rapists and sexual aggressors while it has no objection to subjecting the Spaniards to the most ironic and strict of convictions more taxes more ruin more unemployment and more indebtedness Ladies and gentlemen the one who produces while others have his production is a slave With these budgets minister they have turned the Spaniards into slaves of sanchismo Let the Spaniards decide call elections and with all the empirical evidence of the data leave minister Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,52.816654,-3.5128274,29,thank president good morning ladies gentlemen good morning minister today discuss

#PabloSáezAlonsoMuñumer,"Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen we are discussing a non-legislative proposal by the People 's Parliamentary Group on changing and adapting the reality to the employment statistics published by SEPE The aim is to improve transparency to provide a further disaggregation of data and to know the reality of the actual unemployment figure defined as the sum of unemployed jobseekers and jobseekers with employment relationships among which are fixed discontinuities Knowing the figure of effective unemployment is essential to undertake the necessary analysis of the labour market in Spain and to propose solutions to its inefficiencies Ladies and gentlemen something does not work on the labour market when the unemployment rate in Spain has risen from 8.8 in 2017 to the current 12.6 while in the euro area the 2007 levels have recovered and in countries such as Germany and the United States it has fallen significantly Something does not work on the labour market when Spain despite not having the actual unemployment figures has been leading OECD unemployment statistics for more than a year Something does not work on the labour market when the youth unemployment rate in Spain has grown from 19.2 in 2007 to 32 today while the youth unemployment rate in the euro area has only increased from 15.6 to 16.5 for the same period Something does not work in the labour market when we are the country that most jobs destroy in times of crisis and the country that takes the longest to recover Something does not work in the labour market when a prestigious educational centre such as the University of Cambridge has placed Spain at the tail of the countries of the European Union in creating jobs productivity or security in the labour market Ladies and gentlemen low productivity is one of the structural problems of the labour market in Spain By 2020 it was 14.1 below the euro area average and was 85.5 below the United States average and this labour productivity gap is one of the factors explaining the distance of the Spanish economy in terms of well being with other euro area countries We must also remember the direct link between unemployment and economic growth It 's very easy Being unemployed means that there is a lack of economic income that limits consumption and therefore there is a drop in sales by companies that decide to cut staff by reducing income Unfortunately we have a government that by ignoring the reality of the labour market is unable to make reliable projections of its future evolution In this regard the Independent Fiscal Accountability Authority in its report on the Government 's Stability Programme for the period 2022 to 2025 questioned the Government 's estimates of ending 2025 with an unemployment rate of 9.6 In the same vein the OECD which does not envisage that the unemployment rate will fall by 12,5 for the period 2022 to 2025 or the European Commission nor does the estimates of the evolution of unemployment in the International Monetary Fund appear In conclusion I would like to remind you that not promoting the transparency of employment data is an indignity that drawing unemployment data from job seekers is an immorality and a lack of sensitivity that making triumphalist speeches with an unemployment rate of 12.6 is a complete obscenity You are giving the institutions a coup d'état and you are also giving statistics a coup d'état Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,54.3025,0.15074658,29,"thank madam president ladies gentlemen discussing non-legislative

#PatriciaRuedaPerelló,Thank you President Before we talk about the loss of cars let us see where we come from because the deterioration of a strategic sector and job creating sector cannot be understood without the damage caused by this government This sector suffers from a government that does not leave a tax behind It has suffered the consequences resulting from a state of unconstitutional alarm it was declared as such thanks to the appeal lodged by VOX which curtailed rights and freedoms Thus from one day to the next he forced many factories businesses and businesses to close prohibiting many Spaniards from working without indemnifying them for it Many have remained in the way and others are beginning to pay for the terrible consequences of the worst government at the worst time which in the face of its incompetence only resorts to the triangle Putin virus Franco No one is surprised by the criticisms expressed by the sector as to the slowness of the processing of this PART and for excluding part of the value chain from it The sector is going through a critical moment it faces the fall in car sales shortages and strong price increases in parts and components energy and transport among others Ladies and gentlemen it is at stake that Spain has an important role at European and global level but we still hope that this LOSS will be resolved On Monday the minister announced that the government will publish resolutions on the PERTE projects in early October I am confident that this statement will be complied with and that it will not occur as with the special register for LOSS which took a year longer than the deadline set Months ago the representatives of the sector warned of the slowness that the Government was having in the development of PERALTE and VOX recorded initiatives because we understand that the agile channelling of these funds is as necessary as the implementation of additional measures that support the industrial transformation an industrial transformation that must be planned with common sense and not be a crazy race towards the criminalization of our industry and decarbonization with precipitated deadlines imposed by globalist agendas which reduce competitiveness to other countries that are much more polluting a nightly ideology peculiar to the 2030 Agenda shared and defended by PP and PSOE Yes Spain must be a leader in this sector and protect employment but it is not common sense to bend to the imposition of policies subject to climate fanaticism Why do n't you ask the Spaniards what they prefer if their fanaticism is to be greener than anyone else and without looking at the damage that comes or a gradual transition which prioritises the interests of the Spaniards Points of recharge are missing the bill of light is fired the Spanish families are getting poorer every day and from their offices they intend to impose the electric car which is insecure for many compatriots Sanchez will take off his tie but he has put the rope on the neck of many Spaniards This Government has the counted days and should call elections to return the voice to the Spanish people They say Sanchez has a plan Which one destroy Spain They say Feijoo has a plan Which assuming the Socialist Party 's misconceptions does not comply with the law stating that they have no interest in seeing in prison those convicted of ERE fraud in Andalusia 700 million who have stolen from us Andalusians PP and PSOE are more than the same By the way a PP who does not accept our amendments who asks to push this PAST is it that they like to copy It is time to confront the urgent needs of Spain which are not what this progressive consensus says To do this Santiago Abascal does have a plan VOX has a plan our agenda Spain which is not for 2030 to 2050 is for today to regain our sovereignty and the reins of our future so that families are at the center of all policies It 's time for Spain to decide It 's time for freedom and prosperity It 's time for the alternative not the alternation And it 's time for millions of Spaniards who trust VOX to raise their voice loudly because they know we 're going to rebuild everything you 've destroyed Thank you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,47.902554,2.3219032,29,thank president talk loss cars let us see come deterioration strategic sector job creating sector

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Thank you very much for your reply Minister You have Minister the most expensive government in history not a very expensive one not a rather expensive one the most expensive one in history You have more ministers than ever in the history of Spain You have higher burdens within each ministry than ever before in the history of Spain So much so that they have even been allowed to create general directions for close friends of the President of the Government they have been allowed to place at the head of the few public enterprises that still have their cabinet heads their party partners so much so that these public enterprises have a much more complicated financial viability In this situation where you are squandering spending and throwing away in the end the money of the Spanish people because you have also increased the budget of each of the foundations cooperation agencies etc. in the Spanish State you have increased the budget of all of them in this situation of unbridled and uncontrolled spending Spain is facing a very complex situation an increase in interest rates with a debt that you have left us of 120 of GDP a reduction in family savings a reduction in the general income of the Spanish people who are facing a growth of only 0.2 compared to an inflation of 10 that your Government is leaving us of course with record energy prices fuels gas etc Therefore Minister I ask you are you going to reduce that unproductive expenditure of the state in order to actually devote the money to the essential issues of the Spaniards Think about pensions the deficit continues to increase social security the deficit continues to increase as well So I ask you Minister stop spending on nonsense stop spending on marketing stop paying salaries to your friends and please dedicate the money that the Spaniards pay with a lot of effort to the really important things and to those that effectively guarantee the equality of all the Spaniards please,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,49.504295,1.1116977,29,thank much reply minister minister expensive government history expensive one rather expensive one expensive one history ministers ever history spain higher burdens within ministry ever history spain much even allowed create general directions close friends president government allowed place head public enterprises still cabinet heads party partners much public enterprises much complicated financial viability situation squandering spending throwing away end money spanish people also increased budget foundations cooperation agencies etc. spanish state increased budget situation unbridled uncontrolled spending spain facing complex situation increase interest rates debt left us 120 gdp reduction family savings reduction general income spanish people facing growth 0.2 compared inflation 10 government leaving us course record energy prices fuels gas etc therefore minister ask going reduce unproductive expenditure state order actually devote money essential issues spaniards think pensions deficit continues increase social security deficit continues increase well ask minister stop spending nonsense stop spending marketing stop paying salaries friends please dedicate money spaniards pay lot effort really important things effectively guarantee equality spaniards please
#RodrigoJiménezRevuelta,With all due respect Madam President Ladies and gentlemen good morning Do you know what are the main objectives of the Next Generation funds associated with the Recovery and Resilience Mechanism According to the European Commission there are three helping Member States to recover relaunching the economy and supporting private investment Currently none but none of the three objectives are being met First of all because the recovery of our country so often mentioned by the Executive is a dream more of one Government that lies and that recounts an illusionist speech full of sweet smell of naphthaline perhaps prelude to parliamentary dysfunction The funds should be used to carry out investments in the public and private sectors to improve the productivity of the economy but they are not becoming a lever for economic growth and their impact has been virtually nil in 2021 and scarce in 2022 according to the AIReF and the Banco de España During the year 2021 there was a drop in Spanish productivity never before seen in economic history 6.6 lower than at the beginning of the crisis,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,53.282864,-2.2535362,29,due respect madam president ladies gentlemen good morning know main objectives next generation funds associated recovery resilience mechanism according european commission three helping member states recover relaunching economy supporting private investment currently none none three objectives met first recovery country often mentioned executive dream one government lies recounts illusionist speech full sweet smell naphthaline perhaps prelude parliamentary dysfunction funds used carry investments public private sectors improve productivity economy becoming lever economic growth impact virtually nil 2021 scarce 2022 according airef banco de españa year 2021 drop spanish productivity never seen economic history 6.6 lower beginning crisis
#RodrigoJiménezRevuelta,"Thank you very much Ladies and gentlemen Spain has the lowest productivity of the great powers of the euro it is 7 points below the European Union average and not the base of 100 European benchmarks since at least 2005 Secondly as far as the funds should have revived the Spanish economy the situation is as follows and ladies and gentlemen these are data Spain 's GDP in the second quarter of 2022 is 2.6 lower than the figures for the fourth quarter of 2019 The trade deficit has increased to 31 963 million in the first quarter Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the European Union and the total number of unemployed is more than 3.3 million unemployed including the unemployed and those of limited availability and as you know August has closed with 190,000 fewer jobs adding up to 40,000 more unemployed The indebtedness of public administrations has reached a historical peak and already exceeds 1.47 billion euros Inflation in July as has already been said here this morning was confirmed at 10.8 and in August it is 10.5 while the euro area average remains below 9 Thirdly on the objective of supporting private investment the Executive once again demonstrates its incompetence in boosting the economy In the first half of the year they have only made payments from the funds amounting to EUR 2620 million i.e. 9,2 of the budgeted for the whole year according to data published by the General Intervention of the State Administration Of this volume of payments 65 i.e. EUR 17 billion have been paid to the Autonomous Communities to publish their calls and tenders the pace of which is unknown since they are not made public This means that in practice the money that has come to private companies and public bodies is only EUR 920 million The reality ladies and gentlemen is that the money from the funds is not reaching the self employed SMEs or small businesses What are the reasons Excessive red tape only 14 of SMEs plan to participate in the award processes deadlines that cannot be met sometimes there are only ten days for the registration of applications lack of transparency and opacity in the destination of the funds little and late execution of the funds when the main focus of the funds their destination is the public sector and a scant impact on the economy as I have said before as the AIReF has commented That is why since VOX and considering the motion tabled today by the People 's Party we have tabled an amendment with two paragraphs that improve the operative part although the People 's Party has expressed its rejection The first and fundamental is to promote measures to increase the participation of SMEs entrepreneurs and self employed people and that money that money reaches the self employed SMEs and entrepreneurs which is not happening Secondly and this is perhaps why those of the People 's Party have rejected it it is to condition the receipt of funds that the autonomous communities comply with the measures proposed by the motion Ladies and gentlemen of the Government and other palm trees who really support it do the Spanish a favour resign for incompetents because the greater their incompetence the greater the misery for the Spanish Really resign call elections and allow the Spaniards to decide their future and own their destiny Thank you so

#RocíoDeMeerMéndez,Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen open your eyes for the umpteenth time Indeed when you realize the reality of what is happening in this country and on this continent it will be late I know you do n't like to talk about demography They speak permanently of the planet say such say which and never refer to the configurative element of states which are people People demography is what influences economies is what influences culture social configuration political organizations Once I mentioned here I am going to do it again today the wonderful Leopold Abbey who said Do not ask what world we will leave your children the question is which children we will leave this world I think it is one of the phrases that best describes the gravity of the situation and the significance of the situation we are experiencing The demography of the nations also has another revealing phrase that my dear José Javier Esparza recently quoted at the meeting Southern Frontier which we organized with the group of conservatives and reformists on the island of Gran Canaria Precisely to claim the protection of the southern border which is the border that Spain has completely abandoned He said that states are not empty containers that if we put 80 million Nigerians in Germany they do n't make Germany they make Nigeria Nations are determined to be a populated territory They are people with their culture with their religion with their political configuration with their norms of coexistence And all that is to replace those populations is necessarily to put an end to those nations and their identities Ladies and gentlemen the phenomenon we are witnessing is not a minor migratory phenomenon which of course has always existed throughout life They 're massive movements They are true invasions that are no myth that have also existed throughout history and have changed the course of it even though perhaps this is the first time that the original Government has starred in it Minister Escrivá has said that he wants to repopulate uninhabited territories of Spain abandoned with immigrants It says this in its 2050 Plan which they want to bring in 250 000 immigrants in the coming months it is said by their media like El País that Spain needs 7 million immigrants in three decades to maintain prosperity That is to say they want to bring in 7 million immigrants by 2050 when their own media as they publish in Moncloa say that foreigners living in Spain now exceed 5.8 million Ladies and gentlemen there are not four refugees fleeing a war no There are millions that you need because Davos orders them because the World Bank orders them and because big capitals order them and that 's the reality Because what you need is slave labor for the maintenance of economies and that in a context of aging of birth and unprecedented non-indigenous birth Ladies and gentlemen look around open your eyes and look at France look at Germany or look at Sweden The multicultural religion that you are expanding around the world that eventual system in which we are all going to enrich each other 's cultures is a lie Peaceful multiculturalism does not exist Cultures have been imposing on one another since the beginning of time and France is one of the best tests in our environment In France there are more than seven hundred municipalities in which French law does not apply It either applies the Islamic Shariah or the law of the strongest There are more than seven hundred departments in which law enforcement can neither enter nor apply the law of that country and that is going to happen sooner than later in Spain Ladies and gentlemen I understand that for your theatre you need the story of goodness which is hypocrisy but all the immigrants who die at sea is your fault because you are the ones who throw them into the sea who collaborate with the human trafficking mafias and with the NGOs and those responsible for their consciences all this tragedy And all that because a number of billionaires are badly affected by Europe 's demographic decline for their economies But the rapporteur is one thing and the reality of the streets is another and the reality is that mass immigration loads our neighborhoods and creates Spain 's machetes which is what you are creating And we saw him the other day in Murcia with the amputation of his hand we saw him with the machetes in Barcelona we saw him with the boy who also beat machetes in Carabanchel we saw him with the massive rapes we saw him with so many situations that create insecurity and load our neighborhoods,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,53.6911,11.078237,29,thank madam president ladies gentlemen open eyes umpteenth time indeed realize reality happening country continent late know n't

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,Thank you President Madam First Vice President your economic forecasts seem more like those of a pythonise than those of an economic minister because you are not even close to reality Its general budgets predicted GDP growth by 2021 above 7 which would reach almost 10 with the implementation of European funds The reality has been a GDP growth of 5 that is half of what it announced and a null and void execution of European funds that have not reached the real economy Well yes some digitizing agents have arrived The results of your economic policy for which you are responsible have generated the biggest fall in GDP in all the countries of the European Union almost 11 a debt of 120 on GDP an inflation that points to 10 the largest in thirty seven years and all this with the only recipe you know how to apply to raise taxes to create ministries and to spend without tin In the face of a slowdown in the economic recovery which you augured as robust and which is staggering in this you have not been right either Spain faces the risk of an inflation aggravated by Russia 's invasion of Ukraine And I ask you in the face of this panorama do you believe that the Spaniards trust the economic policy of their government,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,51.7266,2.3769252,29,thank president madam first vice president economic forecasts seem like pythonise economic minister even close reality general budgets predicted gdp growth 2021 7 would reach almost 10 implementation european funds reality gdp growth 5 half announced null void execution european funds reached real economy well yes digitizing agents arrived results economic policy responsible generated biggest fall gdp countries european union almost 11 debt 120 gdp inflation points 10 largest thirty seven years recipe know apply raise taxes create ministries spend without tin face slowdown economic recovery augured robust staggering right either spain faces risk inflation aggravated russia 's invasion ukraine ask face panorama believe spaniards trust economic policy government

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,"Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen When we discuss taxes this government usually looks towards Europe with the excuse that in Spain the tax burden is lower than in the European Union and its preferred word appears harmonisation a term that the government administers at its convenience Harmonize to raise the tax bill to the Spaniards the perfect excuse to raise taxes And at the same time harmonize the criminal rates to reduce the sentences of the present and future to the seditious I ask you ladies and gentlemen of the Government why are you not so bold to harmonize for example the unemployment rates in Spain of 12.7 with those in Germany which are at 3 or with the European average of 6 Why do they not harmonise the gross domestic product per capita of each Spanish which is currently EUR 25 500 with the European average or that of Germany which is EUR 43 290 For I tell you for this they have neither haste nor audacity because they do not know how to do it and the worst is that they do not care The controversial left resorts to the European measuring rod to report that in Spain the fiscal pressure is lower an indicator that does allow us to compare with other countries but in a simplistic way since it does not measure how many taxes we pay citizens or which citizens pay them but how much the state collects So if we want to have a true picture of the effort made by businesses and families we should look at the tax sacrifice that takes per capita income into account I give you an example imagine a gentleman who earns 100,000 euros and another gentleman who earns 10,000 euros and that both are subject to the same fiscal pressure 40 Although proportionally they pay the same who makes the greatest effort Of course the one with the lowest income the one with 10 000 For that is the case in Spain in relation to other countries of the European Union that have a higher income than we do and precisely this view government wants to equate our fiscal pressure with that of them with us having a lower income Therefore we Spaniards would always make a greater sacrifice and tax effort Since Pedro Sánchez settled in Moncloa lying to his constituents and to the rest of the nation he has devoted every minute of the legislature to governing against the interests of Spain and therefore against the Spaniards allied with nationalists and separatists and with lords who used to charge a revolutionary tax for the sole purpose of shielding sanchismo in power at the high price of leaving the nation and its citizens unprotected with a continuous assault on the institutions and the liquidation of the separation of powers Within these budgets of populism ruin surrendered to coup the taxes are their cornerstone and source from which the Government drinks to spend without ten a source that the Minister of Finance considers inexhaustible as well as his collection anxiety located in historical maxims due to two factors or rather to two invoices One the one passed by the Government with up to fifty four tax increases in what we have in the legislature and two inflation a punishment for family savings and a price increase that has contributed to increasing the tax bill of taxpayers without the need to raise taxes in the State Official Gazette The policies pursued by a government are measured by their results and not by their intentions as the professor and professor Mr Manso who is now a member of VOX said And it is that separatism sanchism articulates its discourse by dividing the roles of society between good and bad Yes a government that advertises itself as a defender of the weak and confronts the wicked who are the rich and powerful Do you know anyone in Spain who concentrates more power than Sanchez It controls the Executive twisting the Legislature and wants to do it with the Judiciary Therefore if powerful is synonymous with bad he would be the most evil in terms of superlative degree But let us evaluate the facts and not the promises and what have been the results of the sanchist policies How are the Spaniards today better or worse than before Sanchez arrived in the Moncloa The government that said by mouth to supply that it would not raise taxes to the middle classes and to the workers the only thing that has lowered are the penalties and punishments to the coup and the rapists the per capita income of the Spaniards less today than in 2018 the gross domestic product which does not exceed the figure of 2019 the purchasing capacity of the Spaniards the quality of education with the general approved and the expectations of the future for young people and families condemning them to subsidy and despair On the other hand what has been increased with the government of Pedro Sánchez Inequality among Spaniards lack of protection for women and insecurity on the streets the risk of poverty which already affects more than 13 million Spaniards public debt above EUR 1 billion structural deficit close to 4 energy bill social contributions and fiscal pressure from 35 to 39 This is the summary of the communist social cuts to the prosperity of the Spanish a greater fiscal pressure and collection record whose achievements have been to increase the gap of inequality and greater poverty for Spanish society as a whole But not satisfied and in order to further deepen this inequality injustice and setback to approve these budgets have vetoed all the amendments tabled by the parliamentary groups proposing to reduce taxes admitting four nationalist amendments of the PNV which sweep home that is a classic of course to which the compromise amendment with Squerra Republicana adds which says you can try to give another coup d'état in Catalonia that we are on sale Finally and not least the Spanish must be aware of the need for politicians to demand greater efficiency in public spending because after all that money comes from their pocket with greater control and transparency but what to expect from a government of glorious phrases such as that public money is nobody's The left seeks an economy and a society that is sad exhausted surrendered to the public authorities and to the generalized subsidy Of course getting this costs money and you have to finance it and what better way to do it than by raising taxes to the right and wrong The classic recipe of socialism they sell progress and remain anchored in the 19th century Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,51.997547,-0.5357788,29,"thank president good

#PabloJuanCalvoListe,Thank you President Mr Guitarte you know that in VOX we are advocates of the zero based budgetary methodology for all administrations and this you propose to increase the percentage of the financial allocation to local entities simply we do not share His motion talks about the need to reform the financing of small municipalities in order to correct the aggravation in rural Spain and we ask him for what purpose Well if what he is trying to do he says is to contribute open quotes to environmental sustainability and to the quality of the landscape close quotes this is not going to prevent bleeding or the people 's winter What globalist agenda has he copied from Neither in her question nor in the Minister 's reply nor in her motion nor in her speech have we heard two fundamental words today birth and family It 's essential to talk about them If not what population are you referring to today or in the future To live who Mr. Guitarte The family is the institution best valued by the Spaniards embryo of society and guarantor of the future of our nation However there is no real and effective support from the administrations Where are children birth policies differentiated taxation communications transport the defence of agriculture and livestock more resources to cover basic services in unpopulated areas What are those areas Do you know that Does the government know Do you know the European Union Should n't we start here Could we not start with that map accepted by the Ombudsman which included much of the Spanish geography At a time when the Constitution is being trampled on it is particularly important to denounce that there has been no intention of fulfilling the mandates of article 138 solidarity cohesion and balance between the regions of Spain within their unity The Government looks with contempt at the rural areas their traditions their ways of life and their resources and in short at their very identity which have been fundamentally neglected since the 2030 Agenda incompatible with the defence of Spain and its needs causing particular damage to its inhabitants causing further emptiness of these territories It is abandoned Spain it is the failure of the autonomous model up to six competent administrations to fight against depopulation seeking the same formula of financing as you postulate that of always more is better immense increase in public spending and budgetary multiplication which are a ballast for the citizen with permanent concessions of bipartisanism to separatists always dissatisfied with the self government achieved insolidary and disloyal with the national project making it necessary today to stop the coup de Sánchez Forty years of autonomous statehood have left a political community divided into seventeen kingdoms of taifas administrative chaos weakened emotional ties and an unequal Spain In VOX we think that intelligent use of fiscal policy can help create incentives to curb depopulation and increase birth rate reductions in tax figures such as IRPF ITP companies autonomous quotas and incentives to hire We must reduce taxes on its inhabitants and eliminate many of them Without services and with high taxes who will stay in those places The money has to be in the pocket of the Spaniards better than in the hands of the administrations but we know that thanks to the government and its partners next year 2023 will be marked by a remarkable increase in taxes Abolition of the municipal surplus tax or exemption from the transmission of the taxpayer 's usual family home if reinvested in a new one and access to education up to the age of three health services the Internet and high speed These must be basic priorities Demography can't be improvised The lack of specific policies has led us to this very difficult and very slow reversal situation Depopulation not only means that certain areas of Spain are emptied it supposes empty villages without soul they are land without sowing they are forgotten traditions they are lost causes they are buildings in ruins it is buried history and people uprooted remember families and children because as stated in an

Palencia León Salamanca Asturias Cáceres Ávila Cuenca Jaén Soria and Teruel Twenty years have been enough for almost 2000 villages in Castile Y León 86 per cent to lose population and 146 to fall more than 50 per cent In León my land is 9 out of 10 Spain 's second in a more than remarkable decline In the last year 4733 neighbors 15,300 in twenty years The province of León is ageing and moving faster than the rest of Spain Above all it is due to its very low fertility one child per average woman much worse than the already squalid 1.3 of Spain They dismantled mines and power plants in a hurry with no alternatives no future condemning young people to exile The problem is that no children are born Castile and León the largest territory in Spain and Europe is emptied by abandonment It 's a terrible failure They prefer to replace us with illegal immigration rather than foster birth with fiscal and social measures for families Look this is Castile and Lion You do n't have to tell them what the red color of the map means it 's population loss Do you honestly believe that 5G is going to change color and young people will return I answer them no I know they 're bored with the numbers but they 're their numbers You and you are responsible This Saturday Pedro Sánchez was in Zamora with promises two years ago for example the quartering of Montelarreina which time turns into lies It is the same scenario of a year and a half ago in which the deputies of VOX de Castilla y León proposed measures capable of reversing the problem and demanding the elites of Brussels who redefined the extent of depopulation in Spain Their GNP is very unambitious because they do not know how rural areas work do not support the creation of businesses or decide to start their businesses in depopulated areas with differentiated taxation thus creating employment family and children The primary sector that restores dignity to farmers farmers and the agri -food industry is missing and they decide to make investments through this 5G to make their farms much more competitive We must defend products whose prices are on the ground Thirty years ago the CAP budget was 60 today it is 33

#SantiagoAbascalConde,I thank you very much for that low tone disguised which you have used and more in contrast to what you have used today against Mrs Gamarra If I had to make a summary of what you said I would keep that phrase that they should have applauded that we should have applauded him we know that 's what you like I am sorry we have not supported your measures and have not applauded you and it is very simple Mr Sánchez because after a very quick reading of the reality the Spaniards are worse today than before you approved your measures For many false data that you bring us here there is more inflation after your measurements there are fewer savings and there are more difficulties to reach the end of the month By the way since 2019 no private employment has been created only public employment has been created destroying private employment in Spain You are as always with science Today I was coming with the healers and I thought I 'd put it on him until I told him the healers were fake doctors But of course today has brought us a magical solution which is to lower it heating and lower the air conditioning that is colder in winter and warmer in summer Is that a specialist 's solution a doctor 's solution or a healer 's solution What you have done with that solution is to describe exactly the situation that you predicted yourself before you came to power if you had to agree with Podemos that is the situation of rationing charts which in this case affect energy because it is the proposal that you have brought to the Spanish homes I have not reproached him for having talked about other problems of the world we obviously live in an interconnected world but he has devoted half of his intervention in the debate of the state of the nation to talking about other nations that were not the Spanish one By the way it has made a passionate defense of the sovereignty of the Ukrainian nation I encourage you to try the same with Spain although I know you have difficulties considering who your partners are You 've come here to tell a lie or worse a half truth He said that Spain is one of the least dependent European countries on Russian gas well what he has not said is that in the middle of the war Spain has multiplied by four its dependence on Russian gas Do you think this contributes to the end of the war that war that you believe is the cause of all evils Today you have come to this House to try not to talk about the debate on the state of the nation but about a lot of occurrences and fireworks that you brought in which could be summed up by the phrase who gives more He has come here for example to propose that young people be given crumbs that are taken away from their parents by abusive taxes You 've come here to say that you 're going to fight the extraordinary benefits of electricity very well And the extraordinary profits of the state at the cost of inflation Are n't they going to fight them Because you could leave the money in the pocket of the Spaniards instead of using it in bribes with the excuse of guaranteeing social peace You could reduce your Government with so many ministers and ministers and so many advisers you could reduce political and ideological spending you could reduce the allocation to parties trade unions and employers organizations That is never on the agenda of Mr Sánchez the Socialist Party and the Left in your agenda the only thing that is is to tighten up the Spanish According to you the solution is to bring here a battery of extreme ideological laws because you have announced an impressive amount of laws that you will bring in autumn to generate confrontation in Spanish society You are the one who seeks it even if you then lower your voice in this rostrum with Bolivarian measures in all aspects that bring more confiscation more taxes and always more public spending that Spanish society has to pay that same society that does not arrive at the end of the month that same society that has difficulties to care for their families and that every month in every dish that it has to take home and in absolutely any movement that it makes in its daily life is being extorted by an increasingly voracious State You have come with a series of Bolivarian measures that have a single objective which is not to solve the problem of the Spanish but to scratch a few votes to Podemos There is nothing more to see than the face of your partners puzzled surprised and angry when you have announced in this rostrum as your own measures that they have been claiming Its only objective is to compete with that side of the Chamber to see if it gets a few more votes You 're not thinking about the Spaniards but about seeing how you hold on a little longer in power Mr Sánchez you said this morning that you did not come to talk about the past but you are already part of the past All his lies all his words his projects even many of those he has said here today belong to a time that Spain needs to overcome You 're leaving if you 're not out already You have demonstrated to your party to your voters to this Parliament to your international partners and to the Spaniards that you have no word that you have lied that you lie and that you are willing to lie to be in power for one more minute And the problem is no longer your lies which we take for granted the problem Mr Sánchez is that every time you talk as I told you before you literally raise the bread As you spoke today in the rostrum the Spaniards the small savers became poorer because of the collapse of investment and savings that many families have every minute you are in the Moncloa the Spaniards live worse We come here to say what we think of you but also to give solutions as we have been doing this whole legislature We have come to say that Spain needs urgent and profound reforms and not the fireworks we have seen today Spain urgently needs a Government to expel from the institutions they seek to destroy the nation Spain urgently needs the repeal of all sectarian legislation and to regain the equality of Spaniards before the law and throughout the national territory and to expel from politics those who intend to divide us and confront us Spain needs parents to be able to choose their children 's education and our common language to stop being persecuted You have come here today to talk about the digital language as it could make many children who in Spain cannot study in Spanish first of all speak the common language Spain needs a drastic reduction in taxes and the elimination of all unproductive political spending and that of the ideological propaganda to which I referred earlier Spain needs a real separation of powers not that you divide the General Council of the Judiciary and the

to protect its field and industry preventing unfair competition from third countries Spain needs although you never talk about it because you have prevented it a national hydrological plan that contemplates the interconnection of all the basins the extension of irrigation and the increase of CO2 absorption In short Spain needs a firm and reliable foreign policy without the pirouettes that you are accustomed to and it needs a defence policy that guarantees our security especially in Ceuta Melilla and the Canary Islands which you have failed to achieve despite celebrating NATO 's lack of

#PatriciaDeLasHerasFernández,"Thank you very much Mr President The Socialist Group which is also the party of the Government calls on this House to be complicit in the use of computer tools for the geolocation of citizens data belonging exclusively to their legitimate owners As the Spanish Agenda says we must defend the national and personal sovereignty of this data something that in 2018 already used the then Ministry of Development through a pilot plan with big data technology bidding by the way of 2017 when governing the People 's Party and that is that it mounts mounts both PSOE and PP PP and PSOE one puts the ideas and the other executes them Let me ask you did it help you Have infrastructure routes or connections improved Did they co-ordinate the territory with that pilot plan No you have n't done anything well yes spending 300,000 euros of the Spaniards on that pilot plan because if there 's one thing you all know how to do here is to spend the money of the Spaniards And not only do they not pay the Spaniards for their data but they have the little shame of costing with their money that attack on their own privacy right against which as I said both the People 's Party and the Socialist Party have attacked Apparently the use of big data for statistical and analytical purposes might seem useful as long as the statistics do n't make them Tezanos of course Even if it does n't matter when the statistics are not in the Executive 's favor they end up putting their dirty hands in any way as has happened with the GDP and CPI data of the National Institute of Statistics which after being questioned by the Government and with alleged accusations of interference by the Executive have mysteriously ended with the resignation of the President of the institution As I said although apparently they might seem useful the truth is that first of all as we have seen despite the fact that a pilot plan has already been implemented no less than five years ago they have done absolutely nothing Secondly if we look at the report of the 2018 pilot plan itself we do not have personal consent The use of big data technology means using mobile antenna records to track citizens recording data every time the device interacts with the network calls messages or Internet connections as long as there is an update of the mobile device or even the change of coverage area This study even draws up an activity log in which the associated information details where we sleep when we leave home when we go to work when we return if there are types of unusual activities in our routine and how far our home is And even though they tell us about anonymous data how to trust the party that has reached the government with lies Anonymous Who knows Agreed Not at all A very clear violation of the right to personal and family privacy as well as the secrecy of the communications contained in article 18 of our Constitution Can you imagine that amount of data in the hands of a government that in just two and a half years of legislature has violated the most fundamental rights of the Spaniards has declared two states of unconstitutional alarm and the closure of the House of Representatives of National Sovereignty Can you imagine that amount of data in the hands of the socialists By the way one question was Mr. President 's espionage with big data or without big data Because we still do n't have that very clear As for emptied Spain you have abandoned them the Socialist Party and the People 's Party turning over the government all these years and now you want to make them believe that with a technology called big data you will miraculously solve your problems Look the study of the pilot plan specifically indicates that the proximity of the tracks would not make it possible to distinguish between terrestrial means in rural areas as well as the fact that users are picked up by the same antennas and this makes the lack of precision up to several kilometers in rural areas Why do n't you stop fooling the Spaniards In conclusion this initiative sets as an example of its effectiveness in the explanatory statement the very management that this Government would have done of the health crisis of COVID in particular geolocation an application that it did was to control citizens and not the virus and failed dramatically If the outcome of the initiative is going to be the same as what they have done with the management of the pandemic it is better that they do nothing Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,51.14366,8.53334,29,"thank

#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,"Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen the political course begins and it does so in the midst of extremely worrying circumstances After almost two and a half years since the arrival of the coronavirus in Spain our economy remains the only one in the European Union that has not yet recovered the levels of gross domestic product prior to the pandemic As we note the Government 's growth forecasts are once again a wet paper but some prestigious institutions go beyond that AIReF anticipates a downturn in the economy in this third quarter which would be the first contraction in that quarter in nine years The productive fabric very weakened has had to make real heroes to survive and is resenting it The latest data on unemployment and membership recorded the first destruction of employment in a month of July throughout the historical series and when there are still 38,000 companies less than before the crisis the Government brings us a real decree law that not only does it not bravely face the problems we suffer but it again carries on the shoulders of the SMEs the self employed the traders and the Spanish families what they are unable to solve Ladies and gentlemen in these circumstances once again the Government brings us an order and command a new real cheating decree- law with very different provisions affecting a plurality of matters with improvised measures some even going to increase inflation further and which of course have not negotiated with anyone and which do not solve what remains one of the main structural problems affecting our country From the producers of the largest confinement of the West unconstitutional by the way according to the Constitutional Court at the request of VOX from the writers of the idea of getting up in the morning to put the washing machine and save on the light bill now comes a new chapter the cut of the air conditioning in summer and the restrictions to the heating in winter the blackout of the windows and the rejoining of the merchants who want listen to this to force to install automatic closing doors in all the shops of Spain before 30 September a real madness And the Spaniards are sick of so much madness because it is now the Spanish households our companies and the productivity of the whole country that are paying for the consequences of an unsettled energy policy driven for decades by governments of the PSOE the PP and its European partners Those political elites installed in their climate dogmas that are now calling for these efforts are the same ones that have caused the problem precisely with these dogmas accentuated above with the situation that they have created of dependence on Russian energy The Spanish deserve a government that promotes an energy sovereignty plan that increases the diversification of energy supply sources ensures cheap sustainable efficient and clean energy and puts Spain and the Spanish at the centre of interest On the other hand you show that you have not learned anything from the situation you have created and worst of all reoccur in error with the usual measures Instead of advocating a realistic adaptation of climate objectives instead of betting as it is starting to be done in other countries for nuclear energy said the other day the president of the Spanish Nuclear Society that Spain is the only country in the European Union that is not revising or even considering revising its programme to extend the life of its reactors and instead of opening up ways for the exploitation of its own resources you opt for the only way you know to impose consumption cuts whose impact on Russia will be zero Moreover now that six months have passed since the invasion of Ukraine Russia is entering 89 more than before for the export of hydrocarbons to European countries and that is what we are selling 15 less volume that is Europe pays more and receives less gas Meanwhile you all pass a climate change law that prohibits us from exploiting the natural resources we have For those of us who defend common sense at the time and alone the penalty was to call ourselves anti-European or climate negatists But you know that we do n't care about that we do n't care what you call us What has already been shown and faster than we thought ourselves is that as always VOX was right It is not that the number of people you call denialists is going to grow but that more and more Spaniards are going to refuse to vote for you and you who have created this situation for you If that were not enough the Government Minister has been able to further worsen the situation in the midst of an energy war generating a diplomatic conflict with one of our main gas suppliers Algeria which precisely made us less dependent on Russia Ladies and gentlemen it is not serious to fire Russian gas purchases until you are able to turn Russia into Spain 's second largest gas supplier while you say you are defending the opposite And knowing that it is not serious to state as the explanatory statement of this royal decree law makes that Spain has a low dependence on Russian gas It is not serious to say that we are less dependent on that gas and at the same time suffer the biggest blackouts in Europe It is not serious to approve aid to transporters who need it while preparing a tax via tolls It is not serious to demand efforts from the Spanish while the president of the Government of the twenty two ministries continues to burn fuel in his Falcon for absurd journeys Ladies and gentlemen a very complicated very complicated winter is coming economic confidence is crumbling growth is slowing down and the prices of the shopping basket are already in the clouds The Spaniards already spend a month and a half a year just to pay that price increase making saving impossible The destruction of jobs comes back and the feared ERTEs arrive after the ban on firing activated by the pandemic has expired The rise in interest rates which we announce would arrive is already here and time is running out Ladies and gentlemen it is not as you always say Putin the virus and Franco This is the incompetence of a government that must have taken the initiative a long time ago but offers only increases in taxes patches occurrences and improvisations such as those that today lead us to validate Do not count on us we will not be collaborators of the greatest destruction of the Spanish economy in the last forty years This disaster that you have brought will be the one that will put an end to this very government

#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,Madam Minister I think that in these months we have already talked a lot about how it is a falsehood to say that the Spanish economy is growing a lot in the sense that that is a good indicator because we come from far behind and as far as we grow we are still the only European economy that has not been put at the 2019 level see if it is serious I mean with you Spaniards are worse than when they arrived that 's simple But not all of them indeed Not only their family members not only their party partners in Spain have also prospered a great deal the seditious the thugs the floot terrorists the pederasts the sexual aggressors the rapists These are the only ones that have prospered in Pedro Sánchez 's Spain in 2022,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,51.08729,4.664572,29,madam minister think months already talked lot falsehood say spanish economy growing lot sense good indicator come far behind far grow still european economy put 2019 level see serious mean spaniards worse arrived 's simple indeed family members party partners spain also prospered great deal seditious thugs floot terrorists pederasts sexual aggressors rapists ones prospered pedro sánchez 's spain 2022

#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,"Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen Spain is going badly Spain is going badly in fact Spain is the worst in Europe We are the country that later and worst we are recovering the pre-coronavirus pandemic levels because we are the economy that has suffered the greatest destruction of its productive fabric and because our homes have suffered the worst loss of purchasing power in the West That is the context in which we are discussing these budgets and unfortunately the latest economic growth data do not point to an improvement on the contrary they certify that the worrying economic slowdown that we are suffering from can be the antecedents of a recession that many institutions already give for sure That is that we are facing an economic stagnation in addition to the consistent inflation that is that you ladies and gentlemen of the Government are leading us to stagnation In addition a particular circumstance accompanies this context and is that we are in an electoral year with municipal autonomous and general elections around the corner and with your determination to govern with your alternative facts Therefore they try to convince us that we are the first in the class so they try to avoid the realization of the slightest self criticism and therefore instead of trying to solve our problems they aggravate them with irresponsible unreasonably and deeply damaging budgets for Spain Ladies and gentlemen the forecasts on which these budgets are based are absolutely unreal The nature of the revenue that makes it possible and the electoral nature of the expenditure committed do not lead to any other conclusion As we have been denouncing these budgets are designed by and for the premise of benefiting not the Spaniards not even the government not even the Socialist Party but only one person Pedro Sánchez And perhaps where most and best reflects the drift of this government 's budgetary policy is precisely in Titles I and II of these budgets that we are discussing today titles that describe the basic structure of the accounts which presents all the statements of revenue and expenditure of the state public sector and which ultimately consolidate a budgetary hole that threatens very seriously the sustainability of our public accounts Ladies and gentlemen in order to grow again with solid foundations to attract and retain foreign investment to encourage domestic investment to gain productivity to create stable employment and to successfully face the financing of public debt in the face of rising rates and as the European Central Bank continues to raise them Spain needs to fulfil a precondition to have credible public accounts and these simply are not Firstly because these accounts are based on forecasts that no one is believed to believe not even you forecasts unanimously rejected by national and international bodies from the AIReF to the Bank of Spain the IMF the OECD FUNCAS and a long time ago which make these budgets before they start a wet paper Secondly because they consolidate a chronic structural deficit with an expansion of public spending even above the extraordinary expenditure incurred in connection with the exceptional pandemic On average serious institutions believe that Spain will grow by 1 next year but you intend to raise spending ten times more giving up even a gesture with those Spaniards who ask for sacrifices that you do not want for yourselves because while 57 of the Spaniards fear not being able to pay their bills in the coming months the government of the twenty two ministries chronicles the waste of the most expensive executive of democracy You ladies and gentlemen are having a public spending party and passing the bill on to the Spaniards Those same Spaniards who are in danger of economic slowdown those Spaniards who are suffering the greatest impoverishment in forty years from the rise in prices those who you turn off the heating in winter and turn off the air conditioning in summer those who you propose to iron in the morning those same Spaniards are amazed at the spectacle of a government that is once again raising its salary which is once again setting a record of spending on advisors which is already 65 higher than they were when they arrived a government that throws away a real fortune in buying wills propaganda televisions trade unions tailor made surveys political tolls and the construction of an ideological imposition machinery by the public era with harmful consequences for all Spaniards and which does so while approving a tax increase with which it will continue to express to the Spanish middle and popular classes The Minister of Finance denied me three times that I was going to raise taxes but at the time of truth you have not left a tax behind The OECD says no developed country none has experienced an increase in fiscal pressure as high as Spain has in these years of Pedro Sánchez 's government No other has thought of raising taxes in the middle of a recovery Believe me that increase in the tax burden when what our productive fabric needed was more support than ever has much to do with us being the last in a recovery that does not arrive in Spain And in these budgets they do it again When we have not yet recovered economic activity prior to the crisis when the total hours worked are 0.9 points below the existing one then with 50,000 companies less than before the epidemic the Tax Agency is going to collect more taxes than ever 17 more for companies than before the pandemic 20 more for VAT and 30 more for IRPF In addition you have changed the system of calculation of the municipal surplus you have introduced disaster the Google rate the Tobin rate the plastic tax you have increased autonomous quotas the VAT of sugary and sweetened drinks corporate tax the taxation of pension plans the registration tax the insurance tax and the IRPF both on the side of labour income and on the side of capital income and savings And the Minister of Finance will continue to argue that taxes have not been raised With these budgets ladies and gentlemen the government is redoubling fiscal asphyxiation You who are responsible for this fiscal hack use many tales to try to deceive the Spaniards with the accounts but ladies and gentlemen the Spaniards are not fools and will react with their vote If you trust us we can promise you and promise that we will rebuild everything you are destroying There 's less left Thank you very

#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,Thank you Madam President Madam Vice President I am listening to you and I see that you are still on the same path Week after week you continue in your heroic effort to convince us that in Spain everything is going well that you are doing everything perfectly and that if there is any problem then it is either Franco 's fault or the virus or Putin's Meanwhile reality goes another way The reality is that the National Institute of Statistics presents us week after week with economic data that you really leave very badly such as this week 's data published by the INE showing that Spain has slowed its growth we are only 0.2 two points less than in the previous quarter and of course inflation in two digits above 10 That 's why his partners tell him that the watermelons and melons are going up but they 're going up absolutely all the prices that the Spaniards pay The truth is that we have been for many months not a matter of weeks but months with bad economic data data that you do n't like so as you do n't like instead of working to improve them with common sense and convrudence as you do n't know what they do is to stop the data subject taking charge of the president of the INE The purpose is nothing but to replace you with someone who likes you As I 'm afraid there wo n't be many professionals willing to play their professional prestige they will end up putting another Tezanos any of their party someone who does n't care to harm the good name of another institution that you stand before It is the same thing that they have done with the Prosecutor 's Office with the CNI or this very week with Indra or what they have done with the necessary collaboration of the PP with the Court of Auditors or with the Constitutional Court which you still go and say they have not renewed it but if you have renewed it with them less than a few months ago Minister You destroy everything without disguise you are already leaving but in your flight forward you want to take everything forward And in case there is little the serious management deficit in the interior that we all know In addition they place Spain in an even more serious situation with its foreign policy errors Since Sánchez 's turn so personal in the Sahara Spain which depended on 42 of Algerian gas he is having to buy gas from the Americans costing 40 more How much do you estimate to be damaging to the Spanish economy for your government 's errors in foreign affairs,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,50.490646,3.1349998,29,thank madam president madam vice president listening see still path week week continue heroic effort convince us spain everything going well everything perfectly problem either franco 's fault virus putin's meanwhile reality goes another way reality national institute statistics presents us week week economic data really leave badly week 's data published ine showing spain slowed growth 0.2 two points less previous quarter course inflation two digits 10 's partners tell watermelons melons going 're going absolutely prices spaniards pay truth many months matter weeks months bad economic data data n't like n't like instead working improve common sense convrudence n't know stop data subject taking charge president ine purpose nothing replace someone likes 'm afraid wo n't many professionals willing play professional prestige end putting another tezanos party someone n't care harm good name another institution stand thing done prosecutor 's office cni week indra done necessary collaboration pp court auditors constitutional court still go say renewed renewed less months ago minister destroy everything without disguise already leaving flight forward want take everything forward case little serious management deficit interior know addition place spain even serious situation foreign policy errors since sánchez 's turn personal sahara spain depended 42 algerian gas buy gas americans costing 40 much estimate damaging spanish economy government 's errors foreign affairs

#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen we have been saying this for years generating quality scientific knowledge being able to transfer it to society encouraging innovative spirit taking advantage of all technological potential is one of the safest recipes to drive economic growth on solid foundations and make a more prosperous society The scientific and technological advances have been the preamble to great periods of growth it has always been so so now in a period subject to great changes in which the spectacular technological advances are proving to have an extraordinary capacity to increase the productivity of our economy it was more important than never to fail to science I am very optimistic about the relevant role that science could play in the future of Spain I am also very optimistic about the ability of our scientists to become an essential factor in our productive model but that project would require vision knowledge and ambition a vision and ambition that we have been able to see how in a country in permanent conflict such as Israel it has made it a scientific power a vision and ambition that has made South Korea a country that until recently was poorer than Ghana the world 's most innovative country a vision and ambition that have transformed a backward country such as Ireland into a global technological benchmark In VOX of course we support the pact for science whose success is a necessary but not sufficient condition to give a definitive boost to science in Spain Indeed the scenario in which we find ourselves is one in which we are experiencing the biggest collapse of gross domestic product since the Spanish civil war in which we are suffering an irresponsible economic policy that is lagging behind us in the recovery of gross domestic product in which we have to endure the spiralling increase in public debt which is going to be like a slab on the back and shoulders of our young people and we are seeing a rise in interest rates that threatens to leave our public accounts in a very delicate situation Well in that scenario improving the stagnant productivity of our economy is not that it's an option it 's that it 's our only way out And if there is an investment capable of improving our growth potential that investment certainly has to be in science innovation development and technology Unfortunately the failure of scientific policy in recent decades has not contributed precisely to improving our competitiveness on the contrary it has forced our researchers to work in precarious conditions and in many cases to undertake an exodus abroad from which we have never recovered not even with cosmetic return operations lacking a path for lack of ambition Therefore if there is a time when in Spain we should more urgently support innovation and science to improve our growth potential that time is certainly now And if there is an urgent debt to be paid it is one that we have with scientists condemned to precariousness bureaucracy and lack of funds Science must be supported with determination with economic means with job stability with an effective framework for collaboration with companies Therefore from the VOX Parliamentary Group we support without cracks that the budget for science is increased to 1.25 of GDP in 2030 as the law says or that the situation of precarious work of the research staff is corrected or that progress is made in the transfer of knowledge and results in the research activity But ladies and gentlemen this law not only does not guarantee a greater and better impulse of science in Spain but in many cases makes it difficult In VOX we know a little better than most of you the world of science research and development and innovation That is why we have tabled over 100 pages of amendments that is why we have proposed improvements and we have denounced many aspects of this text which are tremendously damaging to science and today I am doing it again from this rostrum Our commitment to science today leads us not to sign a blank cheque not to accept as valid a commitment that is wet paper if not accompanied by other measures and not to silence in the face of the attack of trying to subject science to its ideological dogmas This law does not address and therefore does not resolve the structural deficiencies affecting Spanish science It is only necessary to listen to the more than thirty scientific experts who have appeared in this House during the processing of this text But the problem does not lie there this law is framed in an educational budgetary ideological policy which if we fail to stop and believe me we will could condemn Spanish science for decades because the policies of identification capture and retention of the research talent begin in the classrooms We need more young researchers younger ones who want to devote their efforts to science Scientific policy suffers in its bases when educational policy deteriorates as is the case with this Government when students can graduate without passing courses when the rule of three or the minimum common denominator is replaced by socio-emotional skills or when even mathematics is used to indoctrinate and the aim is to introduce a gender perspective into science Ladies and gentlemen listen to me do n't fight math math always wins But the most serious thing about this law which is why VOX cannot support it is that it intends to kidnap science to put it at the service of Pedro Sánchez 's ideological project Ladies and gentlemen this bill imposes sex discrimination in the scientific sphere by relegating the criteria of excellence merit and ability to be replaced by criteria of what you call gender It is scientific scientific to charge scientists with gender impact reports for approval of their projects It is a question of establishing quotas as an element other than scientific excellence And what 's at stake is introducing gender commissioners into research teams Ladies and gentlemen the ideology and sectarianism that even this government makes of science will generate the consequence of not being able to count on the best in the scientific field a consequence that we will all pay for for a long time You leave us with an erial a Spain that is lagging behind and in debt and an endless number of laws that have put whole institutions agencies and systems at the service of your dogmas,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,52.82634,-3.9784875,29,thank mr. president ladies gentlemen saying years

#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Our position on this motion is going to be abstention and we think it is a good idea to encourage the settlement of civil servants in rural areas through the empowerment of teleworking This motion however leaves too many loose ends Telework also has its contraindications There has been talk of hermit syndrome that is the emotional and professional isolation of the worker The target of up to four days per week of teleworking seems unrealistic to us But let us be honest the main reason why this motion does not finish convincing us is that settling some officials in empty Spain is not going to be exactly the solution to our demographic disaster The recent study on the ageing of the staff of the General Administration of the State published in 2012 concludes that the average age of the Spanish official is fifty one years Bringing some officials over fifty years of age to finish their working lives in the villages of Soria or Teruel is not going to represent a great rejuvenation for those territories By the way provinces such as Teruel Zamora or Soria old unpopulated provinces offer us an early picture of what the future of Spain will be if we fail to revive our birth It is true that the demographic situation in those provinces is aggravated by the exodus to other areas for example it has been estimated that one in five young people in Castile and León leave their region in search of opportunities But the main reason that half of Spain is being emptied is not that the young people are leaving but that these young people did not even become born For example the province of Teruel has lost 19 per cent of its population since 1976 but if it had maintained the fertility rate of Spain as a whole in 1976 which was 2.7 children per woman the current population of Teruel despite the juvenile exodus would be 14 per cent higher than in 1976 The current fertility rate of Teruel is 1.3 children per woman in fact it is one tenth higher than the national average which is 1.2 children per woman This means that in Spain as a whole we are 45 below the generational replacement rate which is 2.1 children per woman that is we are having more than half of the children that would be needed to simply ensure the replacement of generations All of this means that in Spain we are on a path of demographic suicide as a nation We are the only political group that dares to speak of the sinking of birth as a serious national problem The other parties especially those of the coalition of government assume the synecdoch of reducing the so called demographic challenge to the rural exodus as if our only demographic problem and we do not deny that it is a problem is that the people of Soria or Teruel go to Madrid or Barcelona and not that not enough children are born For example the National Strategy against the Demographic Challenge approved by this Government in its dozens of pages does not use words once as a father mother children or family it is that the sinking of birth together with the progressive disappearance of marriage in Spain less and less people are married is one of the causes of the collapse of birth The weakening of family ties are taboo issues for progressive consensus parties The left has made its own two anti-natalist ideologies,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,51.378826,9.76526,29,good afternoon ladies gentlemen position motion going abstention think good idea encourage settlement civil servants rural areas

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,The truth is that it is a shame that you did not appear at the last control session to the Government just before the elections at the request of our group Someone told him to hide at home And it 's a shame because every time you talk about any matter the support in the street and in the ballot box is multiplied by thousands to our political group the only social and patriotic alternative to communism You were able to check it last Sunday where your communist group went from having two prosecutors to staying with one Lost 50 And one by the hair worth the redundancy Instead our political group went from one to three brave and gallant prosecutors Minister look it is a real crime that a minister of the Kingdom of Spain dares to attack a social and economic sector as strategic as livestock and food but to do so abroad is already an aggravating factor that makes it a crime of high treason or a crime against the homeland Look at you Minister it 's absolutely false what you said And as we were told by hundreds of farmers from all over Castile and León I will answer on your behalf when you say that Spanish meat is of poor quality here the only thing there is of poor quality is a minister like you and this ignorant government with the real problems of the rural world When you say that the Spanish industry pollutes here the only thing that pollutes are the false and sectarian messages that through their subsidized media transmission straps those that were once called journalists and that today are propagandists of the lie they play the game And when you Minister say that animals are abused in Spain here the only thing that is abused in Spain is the Spaniards with their harmful fiscal policy with their sectarianism and their political totalitarianism and what is equally serious with their corrupt policies Minister do not lie the economy of Spain is at stake and if you do not have the status of minister resign It 's that simple Thank you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,54.423946,9.277307,29,truth shame appear last control session government elections request group someone told hide home 's shame every time talk matter support street ballot box multiplied thousands political group social patriotic alternative communism able check last sunday communist group went two prosecutors staying one lost 50 one hair worth redundancy instead political group went one three brave gallant prosecutors minister look real crime minister kingdom spain dares attack social economic sector strategic livestock food abroad already aggravating factor makes crime high treason crime homeland look minister 's absolutely false said told hundreds farmers castile león answer behalf say spanish meat poor quality thing poor quality minister like ignorant government real problems rural world say spanish industry pollutes thing pollutes false sectarian messages subsidized media transmission straps called journalists today propagandists lie play game minister say animals abused spain thing abused spain spaniards harmful fiscal policy sectarianism political totalitarianism equally serious corrupt policies minister lie economy spain stake status minister resign 's simple thank
#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen We come back here with the issue of taxing banking and energy for extraordinary profits now adorned with the tax on big fortunes It is interesting what Mr Bel has told you check where there have been more benefits than in banking and energy He did not want to give them ideas but Mr. Mazon did give them one the pharmaceuticals and I will give them another the funeral homes Funeral homes have made a lot of money during the crisis Mr Baldoví if you want to be Basque and Navarro it is easier make yourself Spanish a nation of equal people regardless of the territory You 'll have it a lot more solved and so you do n't have to go around so much Mr. Regó the 60 billion did n't go to the bank they went to the boxes Mr Margall indeed the cuts were in 2010 but it is that Mr Rajoy did not win the elections until November 20 2011 and entered the government on December 21 2011 and still Mr Rajoy 's powers were not retroactive And then for those who define the poor as the two lowest income deciles and complain there have been those who complained here that it is always 20 of course 2 for 10 always gives 20 If you define the poor as the two lowest deciles it will always be 20 whatever this government does and whoever comes It 's not worth much but I 'm going to stop at the three big groups of problems that this rule has The first the procedures We are called on 10 November to the Bureau and the Board of Spokesmen for the 15th meeting to allow the text to proceed On the 11th day the next day we are also quoted not anymore to the Bureau and the Board of Spokespersons but to the Board of Spokespersons so that half an hour after the Bureau and the Board of Spokespersons we constitute the Board of Spokespersons It is approved that the Commission will meet in 48 hours but we will not be given the text In forty eight hours the vetoes of the Government are accepted which the next day the Government raises what it wants me to say and on the 17th everything is approved and today we are already discussing it So these were the rushes and the urgent procedure has turned you into express This was a first group Second group then there are constitutional problems as you know It does not seem reasonable to introduce this tax on big fortunes as an amendment to the first tax text or to assume that the new figure of the tax on big fortunes is not redundant with the property tax or to turn the tax or rather the tax it is actually a tax although you have called it a tax to energy and banking on income and not on profits as we have told you I have told him and some of those who have preceded me in speaking have told him Thirdly there are the economic problems in the text Without being exhaustive first you seek to tax the extraordinary profits but you tax the revenues and the financial margin and you do not allow deducting the expenses necessary to obtain them and second you are penalizing the investment in Spain both banking and energy They do not take into account the timing of the economic cycle as the European Central Bank has warned them They do not take into account cost translation problems If you 're blinding one route of cost translation maybe we 'll find another I have already warned in this plenary when Citizens tabled an amendment to the whole and this may happen to move to the workers That is true I think you are bringing an amendment to raise the minimum level of the tax on big fortunes from 3 to 3.7 million I imagine because there is someone in the Council of Ministers who is on that stage But none of this nothing nothing none of this is important absolutely nothing the important is something else It gives you absolutely the same thing whether these taxes can be applied or not it gives you absolutely the same thing given the legal inconsistencies and indeterminateness of which the text is plagued It gives you the same thing that this tax can become unconstitutional It gives you absolutely the same thing to have to return the amounts previously entered with your corresponding interest of delay You are given absolutely the same economic consequences of the tax because of course to say that we take 3 billion to these pretendedly rich and left to the state which must be another purportedly poor that we give them to the state look you do not evaluate that taxes are not only that taxes have a series of economic consequences and you may be destroying more wealth than that which you transfer from the pocket of those taxed to the state They have n't considered it either If you want to end poverty the best way to end it is to create wealth By distributing doing misery which is what you are in you do not live better In any case what 's true is that you spend less envy that 's how it is And now I will tell you what is important that it is not the three groups of problems that I have told you the constitutionals the procedurals the economics no no the important thing is that you want to say tomorrow we put a tax on big capital and the rich and the opposition did not support it That 's what you want to say tomorrow and it gives you the same thing as the courts will take him down in a few years If they kill him what will they say that judges are macho Or if for example those same judges kill him but while you are in the opposition will you say that the government is fascist And you have n't done it wrong I do n't know if you 're betting or just in a hurry and what you 're looking for is having a complaint by tomorrow because you love having complaints The totalitarian governments are characterized because they never admit the error it is always a matter of others of international capitalism of the Jews the economic elites the judges the masonry the masters who smoke pure the stage of Real Madrid the heteropatriarchy elneoliberalism centralism the Church There are so many enemies lurking under his bed Look at you the enemy is in his head Thank

#GeorginaTríasGil,"Ladies and gentlemen after the unfortunate spectacle of the use of the control session for acts of electoral propaganda we have to do our part to represent the citizens who voted for us throughout Spain Here only retirees and civil servants remain explains a sorian of forty five years who went to Madrid to study the career and never returned In press we read Villages of Valladolid without children We 're doomed to disappear Half a hundred municipalities did not have a registered person under five years of age in January 2021 Another Leonese transport calls for measures against rising prices Each truck spends 1200 euros more per month of fuel than a year ago the field workers are sick of it We just over a week ago joined Madrid 's macro demonstration against its policies which led to their disappearance Laurean a farmer from Palencia warns us The wolf 's problem is very fat the danger is the disappearance of the cattle not the wolf because there are many who have to leave it because of the wolves I had sheep and I took them because the wolf was tying it up and there are cattle farms that can disappear because of that And it goes on If the wolf continues to multiply this way you can run the risk even of attacking people if people stand here in the field What they say Laureano tells us of emptied Spain Spain is not emptied it is vacillated and forgotten In Ávila my dear province there 's a great deal of untapped potential Ten years ago it took him to arrive by train thirty to forty minutes less than what it takes today because although it seems incredible it is a journey that today lasts two hours Or the tremendous case of the AVE which promised the People 's Party government twenty years ago and then re-promised and never fulfilled Promises and only promises that of course no one believes anymore something that the Castilians and Leons should not forget nor should they forget the restrictions on freedom the imposition of curfews and harassment on the hoteliers or the toll on the highway which today costs 20 euros round and round which the users have been paying for forty years and which still with their Government will have to continue paying Or the shortage of bus service throughout the province It could continue with health with the languishing industry and with the slow death of local trade This is just a sample of Spain abandoned and silenced A sepulchral silence reigns in many of its squares There are no children or families and the elderly who are very old hardly leave the house Spain is in a very serious demographic situation that threatens its survival The loss of population and its ageing are accelerated each year In Galicia Asturias and Castile and Leon die more than double the number of people born In Zamora Leon Asturias and Soria the proportion is three deaths per birth If current birth and life expectancy rates are maintained by 2055 there will be more people of seventy eight years of age than people in any other age group The demographic winter is a cancer that affects our entire nation but it is advancing in some territories faster than in others those of Spain abandoned by you political leaders of the PSOE and the People 's Party And it is that the economic situation of these regions is in free fall because without children there is no future without demographic growth there is no economic growth and this economic downturn makes investment something vital linked to birth less attractive for that Spain so worthy and necessary and of which we are so proud Let us see the example of Castile and León the cradle of our history and where the People 's Party has ruled for thirty five years He is a leader in depopulation almost 200,000 Spaniards have had to leave this region since you ruled ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party He is a leader in expelling young university students a punishment of exile for being Castilian Leonese The Community of Castile and León is the main expelling zone for qualified persons from all over Spain He is the leader in the ageing and ageing population the second oldest region in Europe after Asturias 26 of Castilians and Leonians are sixty five years old or older and 36 are over eighty years old many of them dependent with neurodegenerative problems and insufficient care due to the large dispersal of the population living in small villages with little inhabitants and without services Because depopulation causes one to enter a vicious circle in which among other things social services worsen dramatically And the worst ladies and gentlemen minister leader in solitude Castilla y León is Spain 's second largest autonomous community with more people living alone no less than 30 Our elders those who have taught us the value of work and family those who preserve our traditions our roots our cultural heritage are alone and abandoned scattered and poorly cared for Grandparents who have seen how their families children and grandchildren have had to leave the village and its province to look for work and to build a life Minister the repopulation of rural Spain is crucial to ensuring prosperity and territorial vertebration The ministry to which you represent of Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge will not solve this problem because it is only a branch of the globalist elites who want to impose concepts such as ecological transition global strategies resilience and sustainable development goals bono masks of the perverse 2030 Agenda We on the other hand propose another life to the Spaniards to the children to the young and to the elderly And with us for the moment half Europe that of the sovereign nations and soon much of America because we must regain our national sovereignty defend our lifestyle our customs our traditions our history our roots and our borders also our industry and our system of sovereign production which allows us to live from what we produce and not be subject to the unfair competition of third parties We have a duty to think and to propose all the measures that are necessary for companies and entrepreneurs to be able to establish and maintain themselves in those territories for example with favourable taxation Because we defend equality between Spaniards and we are going to face the insurgency of the autonomous state which creates first and second Spaniards which prevents water from reaching where it is needed and with a fair distribution and above all which penalizes the regions most loyal to Spain and its identity The Popular Party in Castile and León is what the PSOE has been in Andalusia a client and caciquil network that prevents the growth of the provinces to have them controlled the power at the cost of the Spanish Today we have just witnessed a farce in which the People 's Party shows that it is against the PSOE when in reality it is subject to the same dictates of the globalist agenda and defending that agenda is compatible with defending the true interests of the Spaniards and our sovereignty Ladies and gentlemen of the PP or Agenda Spain or Agenda 2030 or the interests of the Spanish and Spain or the interests of the globalist elites or our traditions our culture our roots our nation or the existential vacuum And at this moment I allow myself to address our young people because we are here for them and for those children who listen to us many of whom cannot even vote Dear young people do n't be fooled The promise of an easy and subsidized life is a deception to have you controlled and subdued to make you unable to build something for yourself Do n't let them fool you All those who now rule bad than good have grown up in a family that no one questioned because it was always there with its lights and with its shadows They want to leave you orphans so that you have no choice but to fall into the hands of the state Dear young people I have not resigned you connected with your roots connected with your Spanish heart the same one that encouraged Don Pelayo the Cid Augustine of Aragon Teresa of Jesus Blas of Lezo Pedro Claver Ignatius of Loyola John of the Cross and from there draw strength and illusion to build a family Enthusiasts lovers of life do not be afraid to love do not flee from effort and sacrifice when it comes to achieving an ideal a greater good such as building a family getting a job or raising children Do not renounce to spend your time listening to your parents your grandparents your great grandfathers their legacy is our history do not abandon them Abandon selfishness the great deception of our time Do not prove to your elders the joy of a grandchildren who break into their solitude and above all do not deprive yourselves of the possibility of a successful life Do not be deceived dear young people you deserve a family a job and a homeland do not resign Minister the solution is to give our young people opportunities and boost birth not to import millions of irregular immigrants Other European nations such as Poland and Hungary have already done so Hungary for example has created a strong family support system achieving a very significant increase in birth rate Do not be ashamed to recognize that the family is the basic cell of society the natural place where children are born and where the bonds that last all life are generated where strong free and self owned virtuous people grow But submitted as is his ministry and all the Government that represents the dictates of the supranational agendas it is difficult for them to understand that the family is the cornerstone of civilization and must be promoted and protected if birth is to be promoted To this end Minister you must change false stereotypes and stop presenting family and marriage as oppressive institutions and children as burdens Lately not only do they tell us barbarities like cows pollute but even children pollute and that to curb climate change the solution is to have fewer children Madam Minister be aware of the serious problem we have in our hands The Spaniards want to eat products from the land and not synthetic meat We want safe villages full of families not wolf herds where castles walls and temples do not fall to pieces We want to see happy children with their parents and grandparents filling schools and parks and not desolate villages We want young people with work full of confidence in their future and not sunk into a senseless life and subjected to the penalty of banishment In short we want the Spaniards to be proud of their homeland Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,49.323906,9.879943,29,"ladies gentlemen unfortunate spectacle use control session acts electoral propaganda part

#GeorginaTríasGil,Minister less rhetoric and more words Facts none you just said it You are testimony to your own words The truth is that paper supports everything Pay more attention to the people of the countryside and follow their advice tread the ground There are slogans from farmers who say From the country to the house Well hey from the country to Congress Go to the camp listen to them and then legislate based on what you 've heard Your Honor it 's not that difficult it 's a matter of listening It is also a question of listening to each other when we are here in the Chamber I have talked about a whole series of issues that you have not answered You have told me that I have ridiculed the situation of the people of Spain It 's just that you have n't gone there you can see that you have n't gone That is the dramatic situation of our farmers our farmers and many areas that are running out of population I have n't made any suffamation about the children that every woman can have However I have addressed a very important issue that you logically are unable to address what is the problem of birth We have to bet on birth we have to bet on policies that favor family and birth but that goes against their ideological and globalist policies In fact we have already asked some questions in this regard What measures will the Government take to promote birth in all regions of Spain And you have answered us and I read literally Policies aimed only at promoting fertility involve perpetuating the gender stereotypes that must be combated as they lead to an increase in gender gaps and support a reductionist reproductive oriented vision of women That ladies and gentlemen is your vision of motherhood and women You have to put an end to as many complex policies as you have in other European countries I 'll tell you what gynecologists tell their patients in Hungary when they announce a new pregnancy They do n't tell you you 're pregnant do you want to have it They tell you you 're pregnant congratulations A positive and celebrative vision of motherhood is transmitted and lived Please note ladies and gentlemen especially those who are going to vote against those people who are just praying in front of abortion clinics tomorrow Ladies and gentlemen minister the truth is that there are so many things to tell you that we will see if I can put order We have gone to listen to the people of the countryside In fact the 52 of VOX when we make proposals not of law proposals of law parliamentary questions is not that we are there in the dispatch telling to see what we think or to see this news No we 've gone to our provinces we 've talked to people and surprisingly people no matter how much they are hoteliers merchants farmers and farmers all the people we see are surprised that a congressman goes and talks to them But what have they done What have you done for forty years of democracy in this country Real Spain that of the countryside has been marginalized by the media for years and ignored by politicians by you and by you silenced in the chatter in the dishes there is no talk of family of well being of opportunities of prosperity or of the future In fact I think you will also have to talk to one of the Members who spoke this morning who said that Spain must be populated That goes against their policies as we have already commented You in your answer it was predictable was n't it were going to talk about mobility connectivity and child education But for who if there are no children I was going to talk about consulting Yes clinics are missing because for the few children we lack pediatricians in my province there are fewer and fewer pediatricians Older people who are more and more in need of a lot of care have fewer and fewer services Energy transition of mobility they want the Spaniards not to understand them when you speak Maintaining and consolidating the provision of services but if they have not done so until now why do we have to think that they will do so now Finally we really come to bring hope to Spain and to tell all Spaniards that it is possible to live with hope and that we have the right to another future,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,53.74635,9.7872305,29,minister less rhetoric words facts none said testimony words truth paper supports everything pay attention people countryside follow

#VíctorGonzálezCoelloDePortugal,With all due respect Madam President Minister allow me to address my first words to the Communist spokesman whom I see he has already left who with whom he is falling has given him for accusing us of sexists and has spoken of his grandmother but he has forgotten the grandmothers who are suffering because they have seen his daughters being raped by criminals who are seeing their sentences reduced by the law of it is only yes The spokesman has been forgotten the three reports of the General Council of the Judiciary that warned that this was going to happen and of course the Iranian women who must also be second class women have been forgotten Minister I 'm with you The Government has flown the bells as you have explained to us very well by firing the expenditure into a situation of economic crisis Looks like there 's no tomorrow using a Keynesian aggravation In the long run everyone dies and these problems are solved by others Let 's see what your government wants because when the numbers are shuddered things get very well understood If we take programme 142.A action by the Spanish State abroad we see that its main objective is to defend and promote the political and economic interests of Spain vis-à vis third States and the international bodies to which it is a party to enhance its influence on the definition of the international strategy of peace and security to improve its external image as well as to guarantee to the Spanish citizens the protection they may need outside our borders and to facilitate the exercise of their rights That has only decided to increase by 1.9 That is what Spain 's political and economic interests matter to you That 's the reality not the one you told us If you want another example we look at the Secretariat of State for Ibero America and the Caribbean and Spanish in the World which has a endowment of 86 million It seemed a small figure to me but 80 of those millions are taken by the Cervantes Institute Moreover if we remove the 1.3 taken by the House of America 2.6 of the staff and 0.6 for Mr Sánchez presidency we see that the Secretariat of State for Ibero America and the Caribbean and Spanish in the World can do little or nothing with these scarce resources However transfers and deliveries have grown by 41.5 the AECID as you have very well explained has grown by 53 increasing its contribution by more than 196 million euros This is the case with official development assistance and the Government understands that it is necessary to help outside it is necessary to help outside rather than within our borders When the Spanish families cannot reach the end of the month when the companies are suffering enormously from the crazy costs of their supplies we trigger international cooperation in development aid which is 23 in the general budgets of the State to strategic contributions to bilateral development organizations more than 50 million the Development Promotion Fund is increased by more than 20 million up to 219 million euros I recall that the Secretariat of State for Ibero America the Caribbean and Spanish in the World was 86 million while the Development Promotion Fund was 219 million There are more than 100 million in current transfers that have seen an increase of 35 million to non-profit institutions and about 145 million go abroad It 's amazing is n't it What are you guys doing One might think that Mr. Sánchez 's trip to Ibero America was an election trip that what he was doing was promoting himself to become Secretary General of the Socialist International and some might say that the trip is getting very expensive Can you tell me on your trip to the Balkans and on Mr Sánchez 's trips to Ibero America what commercial successes we have achieved for Spanish companies and for the general interest of the State Because what we do know is the results in their elections to the Socialist International It should be noted that in the general budgets of the State for the year 2023 fifteen studies and reports on the objectives of the 2030 Agenda are growing which is to increase by ten the five that were collected in the budgets of the year 2022 I would like to point out that as time goes by AIReF has reduced its education budget by 50 That is to say we are going to spend more money on the studies for the 2030 Agenda on the foreign budget than the budget that the AIReF has in the tragic situation in which we are The things that the AIReF says about their budgets do n't seem to like them and they punish them To the Spanish Presidency of the European Union EUR 160 million I think this is an absolutely important date and we have to do it very well but do we have to spend EUR 160 million in six months 160 million euros In short the growth of 28 of development aid throughout the General Administration of the State is getting very expensive it is very expensive to find all of you the whole government for when you lose the next elections You are indebted to your communist partners and to the enemies in Spain Is it normal for Minister Irene Montero on her recent trip to Argentina to hide from the diplomatic corps the meetings with the Vice President of the Government of Argentina with the Minister of Economy with the Minister of the Interior Is it normal that the new ambassador of Spain you have authorized Yuri Klimenko exconsul in Barcelona who supported traitors and secessionists and that everyone knows the Russian interference in the failed coup of Esquerra and its partners be ambassador in Spain Is it normal that in the meeting we had last week with the Ukrainian delegation here in the Congress of Deputies there were none of the coup parties either on the left or the PNV Is it normal that they did n't come Is that the support of your government partners because neither were the Lords of Podemos a the Ukrainian Members who came to see us What are the commercial revenues of your

#VíctorGonzálezCoelloDePortugal,President ladies and gentlemen I am looking at a mixture of satisfaction and apprehension The satisfaction is that this is the last budgetary device that the Socialist and Communist coalition government is going to bring to this House because they will lose the next elections The horror is for the terrible legacy that you are going to leave in Spain a destroyed economy with a position of your unsustainable public finances Recalling Winston Churchill in a similar situation to which he so much likes to mention Mr Sánchez he said some illustrative words Never before in the history of democracy I add the Spanish had so much damage been done by such small men This budget is based on nothing a macro- economic picture dead before it was born and disqualified by all No one believes in their growth forecast for 2023 and therefore their income projections and deficit target are unsustainable But with that being the manifestation of the constant lack of rigour of this Government it is not the most serious The essential question as always is the sacrifice of the general interests of Spain of the well being of the Spaniards and of the future of their economy on the altar of a fiscal and budgetary demagogy placed at the service of alicorts and mediocre partisan interests and of course of the enemies of Spain Your new budgetary monster Mrs Montero is the final stalemate of the policy applied by you since your sad and unfortunate arrival in power a constant rise in public spending and taxes Since 2018 the first has increased by almost 40 in nominal terms The second the taxes by 31 while what has happened with GDP That we are the only nation in the European Union that has not recovered the GDP levels of 2019 This dynamic of irrational expansion of the state in the economy has placed Spanish public accounts in a dramatic position of extraordinary vulnerability in a context of accelerated decline of activity and rise of interest rates No economy can maintain growth rates of its spending that double the increase in its income and even less so when this upswing in addition to being accompanied by an unprecedented rise in the taxation of entrepreneurs and families need to be financed with debt a debt that is close to 120 of GDP And to close this vicious circle its waste and tax voracity have been accompanied by a permanent and unprecedented increase in the structural deficit They have never bothered to put forward a medium term stabilization plan and despite the extraordinary income achieved in 2021 with the aid of the inflationary tax we will close 2022 with a deficit of around 5 of GDP What about budgets that take up EUR 583 billion of expenditure including debt service a record figure in the national annals that once again increase structural expenditure and call into question the solvency and financial sustainability of the Spanish State What about the new tax figures which with those carried out so far constitute the biggest tax increase made by a Spanish Government in a legislature since the establishment of democracy and with an economy on the verge of a technical recession You have already passed ladies and gentlemen the People 's Party What about the increase in social contributions in a crisis scenario weakening the labour market which does not even serve to prevent social security from running a deficit In fact ladies and gentlemen there is only one thing to say leave leave as soon as possible because only from that moment will it be possible to have some hope in the future What a pitiful example the example given by some members of the Government I do not include you Minister whom you studied Medicine who were supposed to know something very concrete that never at any time or place a fiscal and budgetary policy such as that which they have supported and support ever served anywhere in the world to reduce the deficit debt and boost the recovery of the economy How has Mr Escrivá for example lent himself to this and already excludes Mrs Calviño Ladies and gentlemen today we are attending a funeral that of a government that has carried out the worst economic and budgetary management of democracy His legacy will be a case of study no doubt of how an economic situation such as that faced by Spain is not addressed We have had a bad government under dramatic circumstances and we are paying a high price for it I trust and hope that the Spaniards who are the victims of their actions will return them to their rightful place the political irrelevance in the opposition Let 's see if a long stay in the purge of the Socialist Party helps them to regain responsibility and sanity because the one who is following his agenda is the Communist Party Thank you

#VíctorGonzálezCoelloDePortugal,With all due respect Madam President Ladies and gentlemen of Podemos the Spanish economy has been facing the third economic crisis since 2008 Following the sudden contraction of GDP caused by the pandemic Spain has been the only one of the major countries in the European Union that has not recovered its levels of GDP in 2019 and has not increased those levels It is now facing the greatest supply shock experienced since the 1970s under precarious conditions because of its fault unsustainable public sector indebtedness a labour market whose rigidities have increased its counter work reform it is now more difficult to create jobs very indebted families and companies with declining incomes a crazy taxation and a new energy shock caused by the war in Ukraine which brings us to the head of a scenario of stagnation This scenario compounded by its macroeconomic irresponsibility has resulted in a devastating blow for businesses and families who have not yet overcome the effects of COVID 19 and are entering a path that punishes and punishes their income and standard of living with enormous hardship In the midst of the current electroshock you maintain a macroeconomic picture that constitutes an insult to intelligence everything is frivolity a policy of gestures at the service of the President of the Government 's agenda committed to showing an image of statesman that is pathetic To make the situation even worse they have taken a radical turn in foreign policy towards Morocco without consulting anyone without passing through Parliament violating the resolutions all of international bodies on the Sahara and putting at risk the relationship with Algeria which is our first gas supplier If doing this in a normal scenario is essential doing so in the midst of the worst economic crisis that Spain and the European Union have experienced in the past forty years is suicidal and can only be explained for reasons completely outside the national interest Maybe that 's the price to pay for Mr. Sanchez to get a slap in the back of the sea A supply shock caused by the increase in energy costs is not dampened by more public spending by price controls or by trapping the solitaire in the Falcon the only short term way to alleviate the impact on businesses and families is by reducing or suppressing taxation which falls on electricity and hydrocarbons which artificially raises the energy costs borne by Spanish families This has been done by most of the States of the European Union and you do not want to pay attention because the rise in these prices provides them with extraordinary income for their energy demagogy and to make that agenda that you believe is necessary to continue to govern This only helps to delay the exit from the crisis to introduce ourselves into a new one without having come out of the previous one and to increase the economic and social costs that we will have to bear in order to overcome both But the brutal upward impact of energy prices is also a demonstration of where its blindness and energy policy can lead us because it does not guarantee Spain 's security of supply Its obsession is to shut down nuclear power plants its criminalization of all non-renewable technologies its stubborn opposition to greater interconnection with France and a long time and so on have exacerbated and exacerbated Spain 's energy vulnerability if there is no drastic change in orientation His action in the field of energy is like the horse riding of Atila 's horse leaving nothing alive in his path His incompetence is known his sectarianism I manifest his irresponsibility clear To the sluggishness that you write every day you should add a new qualification for your government you are gaffes They attract upon themselves all imaginable biblical and deep plagues and aggravate them with their pitiful measures This government is in K.O. Technician Unfortunately the prolongation of their agony is in their hands delaying the moment when citizens expel them from power and in the meantime their ability to do harm is enormous Every day Mr Sánchez and his party partners remain in the Moncloa harder and harder it will be to rebuild the Spanish economy As Larry Browne said socialism breaks your legs and then gives you some crutches or as Margaret Thatcher said socialism goes well until someone else 's money runs out But I prefer a Spanish saying year of reds hunger and lice Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,49.116817,2.5746436,29,due respect madam president ladies gentlemen podemos spanish economy facing third economic crisis since 2008 following sudden contraction gdp caused pandemic spain one major countries european union recovered levels gdp 2019 increased levels facing greatest supply shock experienced since 1970s precarious conditions fault unsustainable public sector indebtedness labour market whose rigidities increased counter work reform difficult create jobs indebted families companies declining incomes crazy taxation new energy shock caused war ukraine brings us head scenario stagnation scenario compounded macroeconomic irresponsibility resulted devastating blow businesses families yet overcome effects covid 19 entering path punishes punishes income standard living enormous hardship midst current electroshock maintain macroeconomic picture constitutes insult intelligence everything frivolity policy gestures service president government 's agenda committed showing image statesman pathetic make situation even worse taken radical turn foreign policy towards morocco without consulting anyone without passing parliament violating resolutions international bodies sahara putting risk relationship algeria first gas supplier normal scenario essential midst worst economic crisis spain european union experienced past forty years suicidal explained reasons completely outside national interest maybe 's price pay mr. sanchez get slap back sea supply shock caused increase energy costs dampened public spending price controls trapping solitaire falcon short term way alleviate impact businesses families reducing suppressing taxation falls electricity hydrocarbons artificially raises energy costs borne spanish families done states european union want pay attention rise prices provides extraordinary income energy demagogy make agenda believe necessary continue govern helps delay exit crisis introduce new one without come previous one increase economic social costs bear order overcome brutal upward impact energy prices also demonstration blindness energy policy lead us guarantee spain 's security supply obsession shut nuclear power plants criminalization non-renewable technologies stubborn opposition greater interconnection france long time exacerbated exacerbated spain 's energy vulnerability drastic change orientation action field energy like horse riding atila 's horse leaving nothing alive path incompetence known sectarianism manifest irresponsibility clear sluggishness write every day add new qualification government gaffes attract upon imaginable biblical deep plagues aggravate pitiful measures government k.o. technician unfortunately prolongation agony hands delaying moment citizens expel power meantime ability harm enormous every day mr sánchez party partners remain moncloa harder harder rebuild spanish economy larry browne said socialism breaks legs gives crutches margaret thatcher said socialism goes well someone else 's money runs prefer spanish saying year reds hunger lice thank much
#VíctorGonzálezCoelloDePortugal,With venom the president More ultra ladies and gentlemen more ultra We need to go beyond that With inflation fired as we have and with the more than forty two times which I will then explain that this government has raised taxes we cannot say that we are going to deflate inflation only to the three small sections of the IRPF The rest of the Spaniards what are they thieves bandits Do n't you earn your savings and your money by working honestly Why are they excluded from this deflation by the People 's Party That 's why we encourage them to go beyond beyond We need the Spaniards to get the rent back As you know very well inflation does what it does is to reduce purchasing capacity and the rise in taxes progressiveness what it reduces is disposable income The Government twice punishes the Spaniards with their misdeeds Firstly with a policy that generates higher inflation than that of the rest of the countries of the European Union Switzerland which has also experienced the COVID and which also suffers from the Ukraine war in Putin before it is mentioned has an inflation of 3.5 And it also makes them lose disposable income by raising taxes although the minister who is not here for a change promised and promised that she would not raise them Ms. Calviño stated that the increase in inflation was temporary and kept saying it basically until yesterday speaking in colloquial terms Well it seems that Mrs. Calviño is always wrong you 'd have to put her in the Guinness record It is true that the war in Ukraine has a negative effect on the CPI no doubt but it must be remembered that in February the CPI rose by 7.6 and the war began on 24 February that is inflation was already triggered At the moment the activity rate as you know is 58.71 against 74.3 in the European Union and the so called Spanish poverty rate is 22.6 against 16.4 This is the reality and it is obviously relevant to highlight it The use of the European Central Bank to monetise the bulk of the debt generated by its obscene increase in spending along with its permanent refusal to introduce liberalisation measures to give more flexibility to markets and facilitate their adaptation to shocks has fuelled and accentuated the inflationary tensions of the Spanish economy This is clearly shown by the increase in underlying inflation which denotes the strong structural component of Spanish inflation And if inflation is reduced a little bit it does n't mean that the Spaniards recover the lost what it means is that they lose a little less purchasing power Did n't anyone teach them in the faculty that price controls are an ineffective and harmful measure to fight inflation Hacienda has made August with inflation and collects more than 22 billion euros To explain it to you a good year the IRPF which is the tax that most collects collects 78 billion Corporate tax in 2021 raised 26 billion in 2019 it raised 23 billion That is without anyone approving this extra collection the Government of the State is currently collecting more than 22 billion This is a robbery it 's an indecency and it 's immoral Ladies and gentlemen inflation erodes the income of families and reduces competitiveness for businesses that is it overwhelmingly punishes those who create wealth in Spain and does more harm to the poorest Its sole beneficiary is its Government which is helped by the rise of the CPI to finance and continue its waste This is not only aberrant in terms of economic rationality but as I said earlier immoral You express to the Spaniards to pursue their ideological purposes and in return offer them the crumbs of what they are taking away from us the 400 euros for children to buy video games etc. They are impoverishing the Spanish middle class which is in a unique situation in all these years of democracy after having promoted 42 single tax revenues 8 increases from the IRPF 4 increases from the company tax an increase from the property tax an increase from the value added even if they have dropped it in social contributions 17 increases 17 climbs equals those of the companies than those of the workers because all the workers pay them and therefore we asked the People 's Party to go a little further and we would ask for an ultra plus go further We are very pleased with this measure and we very much thank the People 's Party for echoing the report presented by the Dissenso Foundation in March of this year which was published in all the media By the way by a professor who was the one who coined,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,51.12472,0.20844457,29,venom president ultra ladies gentlemen ultra need go beyond inflation fired forty two times explain government raised taxes cannot

spaniards get rent back know well inflation reduce purchasing capacity rise taxes progressiveness reduces disposable income government twice punishes spaniards misdeeds firstly policy generates higher inflation rest countries european union switzerland also experienced covid also suffers ukraine war putin mentioned inflation 3.5 also makes lose disposable income raising taxes although minister change promised promised would raise ms. calviño stated increase inflation temporary kept saying basically yesterday speaking colloquial terms well seems mrs. calviño always wrong 'd put guinness record true war ukraine negative effect cpi doubt must remembered february cpi rose 7.6 war began 24 february inflation already triggered moment activity rate know 58.71 74.3 european union called
