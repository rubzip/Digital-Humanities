#AugussoriLuigi,Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President I rise to announce that the Lega Group is opposed to the request for suspension I would like to remind you that Senator Lanzi is accused of serious offense against a man it does not matter that he is a Member of the other branch of Parliament disabled affected by his fragility We have been convinced by the words of Senator Gallicchio with his heartfelt appeal against the privilege of those who want to escape justice therefore we will follow the words of my colleague Gallicchio We believe that Senator Lanzi must defend himself before a judge with the civil code in his hand with a book and not with a checkbook Justice will take its course What is clear today is political judgment however the justiceists who point their finger at all are the first to ask for protection when one of them is touched Grandparents used to say Preaching well and rocketing badly Finally judgment as a man mine is most disgusting for the issue of disability but it is a personal matter I leave it to each of you go and read your papers go and read the sentence in question and make an opinion about man,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,1.1086599,29.24051,2
