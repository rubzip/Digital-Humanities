#PatriciaRuedaPerelló,Thank you Good afternoon Ladies and gentlemen of Podemos what is a contradiction is that you approve a proposal that generates employment and wealth when you only know how to destroy it If the Socialist Party is to be recognized in addition to being a government of ruin insecurity and betrayal it is the government of propaganda Because it seems that they are already beginning to campaign for the next municipal and general elections as they bring an initiative of a sheet where they call for the declaration of support for the Spanish candidacy of Malaga to host the International Exhibition 2027 Ladies and gentlemen that was already done last September when we received the candidature evaluators in Congress Mr PSOE you spoke about the management of the socialist government in Andalusia What management the one that spent the money of the unemployed on prostitutes and cocaine What management the money stolen from the Andalusians The one that left us in unemployment and misery In the budgets of 2023 Málaga occupies the position number fifty between the fifty two Spanish provinces in investment per inhabitant and today they say they are concerned about Málaga In these budgets we also see an Andalusia that falls below the average per capita investment and this makes us think that this government does not bring Malaga and the regions that are loyal to Spain and rewards 1 nationalists and coups,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,44.393456,5.460275,2,thank good afternoon ladies gentlemen podemos contradiction approve proposal generates employment wealth know destroy socialist party recognized addition government ruin insecurity betrayal government propaganda seems already beginning campaign next municipal general elections bring initiative sheet call declaration support spanish candidacy malaga host international exhibition 2027 ladies gentlemen already done last september received candidature evaluators congress mr psoe spoke management socialist government andalusia management one spent money unemployed prostitutes cocaine management money stolen andalusians one left us unemployment misery budgets 2023 málaga occupies position number fifty fifty two spanish provinces investment per inhabitant today say concerned málaga budgets also see andalusia falls average per capita investment makes us think government bring malaga regions loyal spain rewards 1 nationalists coups
#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Because moreover the administrations that as they do today systematically contract in law fraud as they do today will have to pay with money that is not theirs because they take it out of their pocket to the Spaniards lower compensation than you recognise for improper dismissals in labour matters That is to say all the health workers in Spain should read carefully the few articles because it is true that they have made little effort it is very brief of this royal decree law and fall into the account that the socialist government is a pure scam a pure scam They lie with grandiose words to hide simple realities Everything 's still the same The violations you establish are not such I mean administrations can keep people in law fraud by paying them ridiculous compensation and trying to hide it to hang you a medal What they do not deal with are the competitions for transfers between autonomous health systems They do n't say anything about that and it's a sector claim They say nothing about the periodicity of the competition of the squares which would solve the temporality They do n't say any of this Nor do they say anything about protecting the MIR system the great value of Spanish health which by the way Podemos and Esquerra who are his allies are directly attacking,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,42.444168,3.548292,2,moreover administrations today systematically contract law fraud today pay money take pocket spaniards lower compensation recognise improper dismissals labour matters say health workers spain read carefully articles true made little effort brief royal decree law fall account socialist government pure scam pure scam lie grandiose words hide simple realities everything 's still violations establish mean administrations keep people law fraud paying ridiculous compensation trying hide hang medal deal competitions transfers autonomous health systems n't say anything sector claim say nothing periodicity competition squares would solve temporality n't say say anything protecting mir system great value spanish health way podemos esquerra allies directly attacking
#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Thank you very much Madam President Thank you very much Minister for an explanation that has been absolutely incomprehensible You 've given up a bit of data you 've launched random numbers You say No the tax impact will be of but it does n't specify whether it 's greater gain or less gain and we 're talking about a system that sets tax exemptions It is not clear whether you mean that the Spanish Treasury is going to get higher or lower income You do n't specify anything just generalities In fact he takes advantage of it to campaign You say that the government of Pedro Sánchez has done so much more for the Canary Islands than previous governments something that is not well understood what it paints in this royal decree- law which is supposedly a technical issue and free of political content as you yourself have expressed In short it is better for anyone who has heard it to have the lesson already learned or to listen to us because I think we are going to explain it much more clearly Nor has the representative of New Canarias who has come to pass his hand behind his back been explained much It is absolutely incomprehensible that a representative of the Canary Islands can praise the evil done the improvisation and the exhaustion of the deadlines by this Government and here comes the essence of this royal decree law What none of you has explained is that this rule basically modifies the one established by the Canary Islands Tax System in two of its articles in Articles 27 and 29 They establish the essence of the reserve for investments in the Canary Islands and the Canary Islands Special Area The first of these two tax instruments the investment reserve in the Canary Islands allows companies to use their profits ensuring that they will be invested in the islands by reducing the tax base of these economic agents i.e. it is a tax exemption in all respects On the other hand the Canary Islands Special Zone is simply a physical zone located in the Canary Islands so that those companies that settle in that zone or have facilities in it etc. receive privileged tax treatment But you 've overlooked this These are two very important articles of a rule which was born in 1994 and which have undergone nothing less than seventeen amendments Why Because on a systematic basis his Government and the governments of the People 's Party whenever the deadline for the termination of that regime runs out they extend it but they do so with droplets they extend it in one year two years one year two years keeping the situation in absolute uncertainty So much so that you said today that it is an extensionable regime if necessary that it will be If you already foresee that it will be necessary for the regime to be extended why not do so now Why does it not in this case for the Canary Islands but I say this as applicable to all of Spain a broad time horizon so that companies and Spaniards can make long term plans so that they can plan their investments in the long term The answer is more or less clear yes basically because you have never lived in the real world you do n't know how an investment is planned or what are the average repayment times for investments You 'll say we 're coming to chrispar No we have come to tell the truths that you do not say neither you nor your New Canarias assistants because in this regime Minister you have repeated it several times to date but to let us know who is listening to us the deadline for allocating or committing investments is 31 December last year In other words any company that has an average planning must already have closed down what its investments are going to be as it must have set its targets for the next three four or even five years And you now set up an extension which comes out of the joke which adds companies back to absolute uncertainty Moreover you introduce an additional provision in this rule which reads as follows Please note that this amendment is conditional on the European Commission 's approval of the regional aid map for the period 2022 2027 That is to say despite the fact that Parliament the Spanish national sovereignty approves this rule the European Commission to which the Spanish have not voted have not elected and do not control can still come to amend the plan You have the assurance that the European Commission has already expressed almost complete security to you What is that Minister What company what autonomous what person living in the real world can set up investments plan investments plan your economic activity on the basis that you have been told that you will most likely approve the validation that you bring here today How come they do n't fall for shame I see that he denies it with his head but it is that the situation is unfortunate and you in your verborrhea do not give a single logical explanation that entrepreneurs can serve And it is essential that you understand this especially the canaries who are directly affected by this especially the canary voters of the Socialist Party because what you bring here is uncertainty for all of Spain of course but today specifically with this issue for the Canaries Finally it must be explained that this regime which is very reasonable is justified precisely because the Canary Islands which is a part of the Spanish territory is absolutely far from the Iberian peninsula has great distances uncoordinatedness and difficulty in accessing this core of investment this core of economic activity which is the European Union and the Iberian peninsula That is why this tax regime in the Canary Islands does make sense and it does not make sense the privileged regime of the PNV that regime which only benefits corruption and which in the end does not respond to objective situations because equality and justice means adapting to the needs of everyone What makes no sense is to be favorable beneficial and submissive to the powerful and yet to punish and oppress the most disadvantaged which is precisely what you do by adding as I say to absolute uncertainty and legal uncertainty Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,40.98818,2.133325,2,thank much madam president thank much minister explanation absolutely incomprehensible 've given bit data 've launched random numbers say

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Thank you very much This afternoon we discussed an initiative that raises us Republican Left of Catalonia which is like so many other initiatives on the left a lure to try to attract and empathize with a youth that is getting more and more far between their fingers She is being defended by a very young Member who has never contributed in her life who has no experience in the world of work and who in a way has only been drinking from the honeys of politics like some other Members or 'MPs we find above all on the bench of the left We even find those Members who have never lived in the real world who have only lived in the political world on the government 's blue bench And those political representatives who have never lived in the real world are precisely those who try to deceive and attract young people with those policies that they like so much to the left A minor left at least in the mental sense of the word comes to try to deceive young people with proposals such as vote since the age of sixteen and use narcotics with the legalization of Mr Errejón 's cannabis the only proposal from the left that today is thrown at young people However they systematically deny youth their real options for development They prevent them from forming a family they prevent them from working by closing the industry and closing the sources of income for young people and they prevent them from forming by deteriorating education both at school and at university level Because where the left controls governments education sinks That is what they do systematically and it is important that young people listen to it Because what the left wants is a manipulated and manipulated youth Because what the left wants is a youth that is submissive and closed silent and silent as the Lords of Commitment want with those young people who were sexually exploited and who are not allowed to speak because that would be defending the youth precisely to attack those unacceptable behaviors that truncate the future of the youth in Spain and that is exactly what the left does not want That 's why they only throw sophisms sophisms deceptions and hooks in the hope that the youth will pick up and then hook up That 's all they do What Spain needs is work it 's cheap energy it 's a way of life and it 's affordable housing for families and that 's exactly what the left is attacking and destroying Because since the left governs in Spain companies close every day and if not tell the automotive sectors in Catalonia which every day have less future and less prosperity in their hands The only future that this left offers to young people is the subsidy and the gifted education if you suspend and if you do not strive we will approve you the same if when you reach adulthood you do not get work do not worry we subsidize you but yes it continues to take us That is what you want and that is precisely what we must prevent We need a critical youth a youth who dares to dispel that consensus that promises that everything will be free and we need a responsible public administration a public administration that provides means of education that facilitates those energy systems that provides official shelter and that protects the large families of Spain so that youth can prosper And of course that it defends industry that it defends the countryside and that it defends agriculture because if not all young people in that abandoned rural Spain will be forced to emigrate to the big cities To this day that left no longer allows the exploitation of the rural environment no longer allows them to hunt and no longer allows them to even approach their forests even if they commit crimes against mother nature Gentlemen of the left wake up stop lying to our youth and tell the truth effort work and a responsible administration and politicians who know what they are talking about And here I say to all those young people from Spain who listen to us Who today supports this initiative The CUP those who burned containers in Barcelona Esquerra Republicana those who threw stones at the State Security Forces and Corpses Bildu the ETA heirs who put bullets in the back of our young people the BNG which proposes to tear down the bridges that connect Galicia with Spain and of course and as it could not be otherwise Podemos who comes and defends Isa Serra today in this initiative who was convicted for kicking a policeman Young people from Spain these do not defend your interests work study and demand that responsible politicians defend Spain and that they defend our institutions that they defend education and that they defend of course our industry our field and work that is the real future of young people in Spain Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,40.63461,10.52542,2,thank much afternoon discussed initiative raises us republican left catalonia like many initiatives left lure try attract empathize

#RodrigoJiménezRevuelta,"With the coming Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon A preliminary question Socialists you are remembering the 22nd anniversary of the death of your colleague Ernest Lluch killed by two shots into the head by terrorist Lierni Armendáriz but what you are not saying is that his killer is now in semi- freedom thanks to the third degree granted by the Basque Government after assuming prison competition since October last year Socialists you have no shame and this is a clear example of how you prisoners change for budgets Minister now yes you say that we arrived with strong growth Does that mean we 've recovered 2019 levels Minister do n't lie They present us with budgets of ruin and with a clear propagandistic objective It is noted that next year both municipal and general elections are held You have put the rest into these budgets to promote the Czar of the Moncloa and start up all the machinery Firstly for the Presidency of the European Union in the second half of the year with more than EUR 150 million and secondly full of slogans such as social justice inclusive growth fiscal responsibility regardless of whether or not they fit into reality directing its strategy to more than 14 million Spaniards including pensioners up by 8.5 public employees up by 3.5 and young people with the help of the cultural bonus of EUR 400 which for all that has served ladies and gentlemen is to fill the Wallapop page and exchange the voucher received by the cash and all with the firm intention of remaining in power at any cost But you Mrs. Calviño do n't stay there Now by including an additional provision to the Democratic Memory Act they intend to give away and promise Spanish nationality as if it were a candy with the sole and exclusive aim of obtaining votes Moreover his colleague Minister Albares who sits three more seats to his left is campaigning together with the hordes pumitas in different Hispanic American countries to capture exiles and give them their nationality with the aim of the generals of 2023 You Minister the extreme left of this country because you are in league with the Communists of Podemos with the secessionists and separatists of ERC and with the heirs of ETA once you are in power will do everything possible not to release it even though it is through supposed democratic tools loaded with the most radical totalitarianism buying wills and every identity feature of the person until it turns the nation into a true cave of pirates And who will pay for their ideological delusions and the consequences of ruinous budgets The usual Minister the families the middle classes the SMEs the shops the self employed It is his ministry 's responsibility to pursue economic policy in support of enterprise and reforms to improve potential growth You have indeed stated that SMEs and self employed people play a fundamental role in your ministry and that they are the heart of our economy an expression by the way that you like to say to yourself in many of your interventions Well Minister your policies are bleeding the SMEs and the self employed Currently 40 of small and medium sized businesses have closed with losses in the first half of 2022 In the third quarter more than 20 000 businesses disappeared and 90 000 remain in a state of technical bankruptcy Nearly 350,000 businesses are in crisis and run the risk of disappearing The ICO loans which were announced as extraordinary aid for SMEs and self employed will end up giving the dots to self employed people Alongside this many sectors have now seen their costs increase by up to 50 due to the rise in light gasoline labour costs raw materials and gas This spiral of increase seems to have no end and is suffocating the SMEs and the autonomous You Minister offer only a few crumbs since within the measures taken you will increase the deduction for expenditure of difficult justification from 5 to 7 and reduce the SMEs from 25 to 23 i.e. only 2 points while our SMEs and self employed people suffer an increase of up to 50 SMEs businesses and self employed people are in a limited situation and can no longer endure Look I 'm going to give you a real example The other day I met an autonomous woman from the transport specifically from the taxi who told me that her situation was unsustainable He was fifty five years old separated with two kids in college with a mortgage and a taxi license Well since before the pandemic to this day the mortgage for the rise of the Euribor has amounted to 200 euros the cost of gasoline diesel in this case 400 euros more in the light of his house has gone from paying 80 euros to more than 200 euros because in addition above his house had electric heaters the shopping basket between 15 and 20 and was frightened by the new rise of autonomous next year That is almost 1000 euros per month 1000 euros over monthly cost and working sixteen hours per day But the bloodiest thing is that when he retires because he quotes for the minimum because they do n't give him the numbers he will charge 960 euros per month working sixteen hours Sixteen hours a day for 960 euros And if we add to this that for the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2023 a decrease in consumption of up to 60 is expected for businesses businesses and self employed people this will cause many to have to close the blind and put themselves on the line of unemployment or if necessary sell everything they have if they have anything left Madam Minister the heart of our economy bleeds it retorts in pain for its economic policies and you are the most responsible At the beginning of this legislature you seemed to be the discordant voice of this government but you only seemed Today with its policies and attitude it is another piece of this Government that changes budgets for votes prisoners for budgets gives nationalities for votes and benefits seditious and rapists A long time ago I asked him what was the boundary between ambition and consciousness Today I have no doubt that you have no conscience and that you are prisoners of your excessive ambition and your own interests so as to remain in power and that in order to throw you because you will not leave from VOX as the only possible alternative we will show the Spaniards the misery and the moral and economic ruin that you represent Nothing more Thank you so

#RodrigoJiménezRevuelta,"Come on President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon The motion that we are debating today as a result of urgent questioning must cause us to reflect on the figure of the self employed Because ladies and gentlemen what is it to be an autonomous A self employed person today is a hero a tireless worker without hours without holidays who rarely falls ill who plays it every day who responds with his personal heritage And now the ruin government intends to give the final stock through a reform of the autonomous contribution system Two weeks ago Minister Escrivá prides himself on the aid that this Government had provided during the current crisis caused by the pandemic aid of course is insufficient Many of them took months to receive administrative chaos and today 110,000 self employed people are still in a state of cessation VOX warned at the beginning of the pandemic Spain must be protected but it can not be stopped Pilar Antonio Luis are some of the autonomous with whom we have spoken during this campaign in Castile and León and who survive the mismanagement of a government that has crucified and sacrificed thousands of autonomous during this crisis We all agreed on one thing we do n't want any help we just want them to let us work they do n't put any more restrictions on us they do n't put any more taxes on us You ladies and gentlemen all the members and groups of the parliamentary arch except VOX refused to be able to work for thousands of autonomous people They did so consciously not only by their vote in favour of the states of alarm declared illegal by the Constitutional Court but also in their respective kingdoms of taifas closing business and prohibiting working in sectors such as hospitality catering night entertainment or gymnastics An example of this is the measures that the People 's Party of Castile and León implemented during the second state of illegal alarm being the hardest and most restrictive prohibiting thousands of self employed people from working That is why this past day 13 more than 212,000 Castilians and Leonians have placed their trust in VOX becoming the third political force of the community and in the hope of thousands of autonomous people I have been self employed almost all my professional life and I know perfectly well what it is to pay the self employed quota every month regardless of the income you have And the government with this reform intends to change the system of contributions of self employed people by making them pay on the basis of net returns But ladies and gentlemen what is net performance and who will provide it If the net return is the result of which is the minus income minus expenditure what expenses will be deductible Is it necessary to apply the rules of the IRPF and the rules of corporation tax as regards the calculation of net return Because the contribution for real income is not the net return because that means leaving the contribution according to the deduction capacity of the self employed Today a lot of self employed people have no activity related expenses If finally the net return is that declared in the self employed 's IRPF what would happen to a possible review by the self employed 's expenditure management Does Social Security penalize the self employed in the event that the net return calculated by the Administration is higher If you appeal to the self employed and then the courts give you the reason would Social Security return the wrong charges and sanctions This is going to turn into real chaos These questions must be resolved in order to guarantee the self employed the necessary legal certainty Ladies and gentlemen of the Government they want the contribution of 1.8 million self employed people to rise by 40 over the next two years and yet the decrease to 1.4 million self employed people is only 10 And they do so by proclaiming themselves the most progressive government of democracy Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party you have no shame For the rest we must now add the rise in energy prices the quotas to be returned by a million self employed people from April to May of ICO credits and the rise in labour costs In other words being an autonomous in Spain will become a real feat These measures are not the result of chance they have a clear desire to collect and a final objective the destruction of the Spanish business fabric and the disappearance of the autonomous directly violating article 38 of the Spanish Constitution on freedom of enterprise Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party

#RocíoDeMeerMéndez,Thank you very much Madam President Minister another year coming from the general budgets of the State I believe that you already know what I have come to say just as I already knew what you have come to present because unfortunately how you endorse your political decisions as my party 's spokesman the most important law of the year the general budgets of the state which is the law that is precisely what the policies that this government is going to implement are going to be that has not changed in its ministry on the contrary we have deepened in the same mistakes You are also a very moderate minister you could perfectly be the minister of bipartisanism PP and PSOE because you were also a very well known personality in the People 's Party as President Rajoy himself appointed you president of the AIReF You who are such a moderate minister you who are so moderate among you and with the powerful but so hard with the Spanish with these budgets Ladies and gentlemen the accounts that come to be presented are the usual ones because they win the usual ones and because they lose the usual ones the ones below the most modest Spaniards the most humble Spaniards We 've explained it to the full we 've explained it a thousand times but it 's okay we 're going to explain it again Its accounts support a political decision which is the political decision of the open borders of mass immigration of uncontrolled immigration You give them millions and millions in programs to help immigrants You are increasing the appropriations for asylum and reception policies by 134 You give millions for asylum and reception policies in the Canary Islands You give millions to Morocco In short you invest millions and millions and millions in the usual policies of mass and uncontrolled immigration that harm the most modest Spaniards It draws attention to the fact that there are things that are growing very much we have said 134 almost 40 support for immigrants and there are things that are growing very little even things that are falling You allow yourself the luxury of increasing aid to immigrants by almost 40 and however of reducing non-contributory pensions and benefits to the Spaniards by 11 Minister I do n't know where you live I do n't care either but I 'm sure you live in a mansion in an urbanization wherever where you probably have security right Well where the most modest Spaniards where the most humble Spaniards live do not enjoy that security that you enjoy and do not do so because of their policies And again we will explain again what the most modest Spaniards are suffering in their meats and that you are striving to deny permanently Why do the Spaniards who live in the most modest places in Spain lose Firstly because a policy in favour of open borders a policy with massive and uncontrolled immigration generates a cultural invasion That is for a numerical question in places where a particular culture is majority over others as you well know because I am convinced that you know it such pink multiculturalism does not work cultures impose on each other and create problems It creates problems in this pink multiculturalism because in the end there are ethnic clashes cultural confrontations and cultural imposition On the other hand they lose the most humble Spaniards because massive and uncontrolled immigration in these places also generates crime and insecurity The taboo theme immigration and crime it is impossible to relate it without you calling us racists xenophobics of everything Well it 's a critical basic criminological issue On the one hand it increases imported crime It 's common sense In Spain and Europe we are seeing forms of imported crime that did not exist forms such as female genital mutilation such as forced marriages forms such as sexual assaults called taharrush gamemea which I am sure you also know very well what they consist of in the harassment and collective sexual assault of men in mass to women who find themselves alone often taking advantage of even the multitudes practices that originate moreover in countries such as Egypt But in addition insecurity and common crime increase theft increase homicide increase and rape increase It is also common sense that on the one hand common crime occurs in the economically most depressed places of course but there is also a cultural factor for the increase of common crime in these places which increases rape when it comes massively to places where there are eighty times more rapes than in Spain places where homicides are much more frequent places where there is no justice and justice is applied by hand This is essential criminology and it is common sense and telling the Spaniards is telling them the truth Do not be afraid to recognize the truth Ladies and gentlemen a third factor that you provoke in humble Spaniards is precariousness because massive and uncontrolled immigration pulls wages and increases poverty as the figures are unfortunately showing When you choose these policies you choose cultural invasion you choose insecurity and you choose precariousness for the Spaniards Is this to say that all foreigners are criminals No no it 's not there are many foreigners with very good will This is simply to say that massive and uncontrolled immigration and its many cultural factors increases insecurity and increases crime The Ministry of the Interior says so I do n't say so The Ministry of the Interior says for example that 34 per cent of the violations committed in Spain are committed by 11 per cent of the population the latest report by the Ministry of the Interior Your Honor I am convinced that you are so moderate with the powerful so moderate with the mafias so moderate with the Davos Forum so moderate with the World Bank so moderate with the complicit NGOs so moderate with those who live like you but that it is very hard with the Spanish And people who are having a bad

#RocíoDeMeerMéndez,Thank you Madam President After all we have had to hear here this afternoon the first thing I want to say on behalf of the VOX Parliamentary Group is that the southern border of Spain defends itself is that Ceuta and Melilla always Spanish Last week Mr. Rufián said that if we were against immigration who would bring us the packages of things we asked for on the Internet who would take care of our elders who would clean the houses or who would take care of the gardens Because Mr. Rufián and the rest of the progress gentlemen want to open the borders for this They want labor for the worst paid jobs The truth is what they want is massive immigration because they want slaves Mr. Rufián says this not only because he is a classist but because he has masters because a handful of billionaires are badly affected by the demographic curve of the West and need to call hundreds of thousands of immigrants to square their results accounts and forecasts In the VOX Parliamentary Group we have three messages for the progressive gentlemen First of all cleaning houses is worthy fixing gardens is worthy caring for our elders is very dignified and what is deeply outraged is that instead of fighting to improve the conditions of the worst paid jobs they bring millions and millions of immigrants to lower wages and further precarious jobs,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,43.382637,8.171192,2,thank madam president hear afternoon first thing want say behalf vox parliamentary group southern border spain defends ceuta melilla always spanish last week mr. rufián said immigration would bring us packages things asked internet would take care elders would clean houses would take care gardens mr. rufián rest progress gentlemen want open borders want labor worst paid jobs truth want massive immigration want slaves mr. rufián says classist masters handful billionaires badly affected demographic curve west need call hundreds thousands immigrants square results accounts forecasts vox parliamentary group three messages progressive gentlemen first cleaning houses worthy fixing gardens worthy caring elders dignified deeply outraged instead fighting improve conditions worst paid jobs bring millions millions immigrants lower wages precarious jobs
#RocíoDeMeerMéndez,Thank you Madam President As I said to them it is unworthy to use millions and millions of immigrants to precariously employ the Spanish but it is miserable to relegate the more modest Spaniards not only to have increasingly precarious jobs but to condemn them to live among the crime insecurity and barbarism that causes uncontrolled immigration in the humblest neighborhoods of our country Let them not deceive let them not deceive those who claim to fight for the eradication of poverty or those who claim to fight for social justice because ladies and gentlemen it is impossible to fight poverty by bringing seven million Africans with no resources to roam our streets It 's impossible it 's a lie and it 's very serious But it is also impossible to fight for social justice by bringing millions of people from poor countries to lower wages and precarious jobs It 's impossible it 's a lie and it 's very serious Let them not deceive you for if today the government regularizes half a million immigrants it sends a very dangerous message that will cause an effect called overwhelming and irresponsible and the more effect called more deaths on the borders This is the case but not in countries where there is no so called effect where the Army controls borders intercepts vessels and takes them to ports in other States such as Australia Do you know how many are dead in the Pacific Zero And do you know how many the economic benefits of the mafias and their accomplices are None Ladies and gentlemen protecting borders works So do n't stop fooling yourself because open border policies are the culprits of every drama every death every truncated life They are guilty of stealing the labor of their countries of the existence of human trafficking mafias of every prostituted woman and exploited immigrant decade Let them not deceive you but above all that they do not mislead you because the main victims of all this are the Spaniards the grandmothers who walk with fear for Usera and for Parla the girls raped in a herd the victims of forced marriages those who have arms amputated by the street feuds Francisco and his three year old grandson murdered by jihadist terrorism in the Rambla de Barcelona and the homeless families with no future and no work who see how even having shared their whole life they have condemned them to uproot poverty loneliness fear and failure Therefore in the VOX Parliamentary Group we have very clearly that the best way to protect the Spaniards is to protect the doors of their home Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,43.426872,8.279945,2,thank madam president said unworthy use millions millions immigrants precariously employ spanish miserable relegate modest spaniards increasingly precarious jobs condemn live among crime insecurity barbarism causes uncontrolled immigration humblest neighborhoods country let deceive let deceive claim fight eradication poverty claim fight social justice ladies gentlemen impossible fight poverty bringing seven million africans resources roam streets 's impossible 's lie 's serious also impossible fight social justice bringing millions people poor countries lower wages precarious jobs 's impossible 's lie 's serious let deceive today government regularizes half million immigrants sends dangerous message cause effect called overwhelming irresponsible effect called deaths borders case countries called effect army controls borders intercepts vessels takes ports states australia know many dead pacific zero know many economic benefits mafias accomplices none ladies gentlemen protecting borders works n't stop fooling open border policies culprits every drama every death every truncated life guilty stealing labor countries existence human trafficking mafias every prostituted woman exploited immigrant decade let deceive mislead main victims spaniards grandmothers walk fear usera parla girls raped herd victims forced marriages arms amputated street feuds francisco three year old grandson murdered jihadist terrorism rambla de barcelona homeless families future work see even shared whole life condemned uproot poverty loneliness fear failure therefore vox parliamentary group clearly best way protect spaniards protect doors home thank much
#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the PNV criticizes the government 's management but little We know that they are very united by the bonds of mutual interest in voting and tolling If what the PNV asked was positive and would benefit the nation as a whole it would be acceptable but you always sweep for your region no matter what happens in the rest of Spain thus generating huge gaps in inequality between the Spanish You have privileges that we do not enjoy most of the Spaniards and that is that those historic rights which are very old suit you when it comes to claiming resources paid by all the Spaniards but if it comes to sharing never What is clear is that European funds must be part of Spain 's economic drive project and not of seventeen different projects that serve to calm the insatiable hunger for separatism and nationalism As the representative of Esquerra said you should have been here this morning in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs because the Socialist MEP Mrs Nasarre said that the Government supported the non-law proposal of Esquerra Republicana calling for absolute and absolutist management of the electric vehicle by the Autonomous Communities something similar to what you request when it is necessary to stress that precisely the Autonomous Communities have received from the funds disbursed by the General Administration of the State 65 a total of 11 578 million euros of which the Autonomous Communities themselves will have to inform logically Mrs Nasarre has said of this proposal by Esquerra Republicana that they agree on the substance but that with a month 's delay which is what the proposer is asking they do not give them time to legislate As you can understand let them say that in a month they do n't give them time to legislate on a GNP when in a week they want to strike the Constitution another on the Penal Code and two organic laws with a proposal for a law it 's as if they were trying to take the Spaniards hair which is insulting and embarrassing Since the last forty eight hours have seen the expression unprecedented events are taking place in our country I would like to take this opportunity to say that 50 billion unexecuted European funds do not have precedents A royal decree that has been being processed as a bill for two years with 77 extensions of time to amend has no precedent Of course you are in a hurry to manage your interest but not the interest of the Spaniards The information provided by the Government through the website on the evolution and implementation of funds provides data until June and when the minister comes here last morning is that when they update it I do n't think this has any justification or precedent either In short the purpose of the PNV initiative we believe to be short lived seeks to obtain from the Government greater budgeting for its provinces under the recovery plan being an initiative that rather than contributing does what it does to claim The funds of the recovery mechanism which should effectively be used to carry out investments in the public and private sectors to improve the productivity of the economy are not being a lever for economic growth and their impact has been virtually zero in 2021 0.7 despite the government 's announcement in loud voice that it would have an impact on GDP growth of 2.6 A clear opacity and lack of transparency in the implementation and fulfilment of the objectives not counting that the private sector is expressing its discouragement and calls for greater agility and simplification in the procedures by also having excessive bureaucracy The fate of the funds is being fundamentally public By 2022 alone EUR 12 566 million 44 of the funds will go to the public sector In fact the Ministry of Finance has launched as you know the COFFEE system a management tool for the achievement of milestones and targets defined in the recovery plan which is 18 months late Finally with regard to the electric vehicle PART we already know that the Government announced it on a drum and platter and has not had any success 877 million have been mobilized Regarding the preparation of the addendum Minister Calvino said in her last appearance on the Commission that they had taken into account the Autonomous Communities I believe that this PNV initiative can be your alibi for what you have already negotiated in dark rooms to come out later because you are the shadow behind the government in everything and for all those who overshadowed Pedro Sánchez by supporting his motion of censure From VOX we will continue working and ending to stop Sánchez 's coup against democracy state institutions and firm in the defense of the rule of law the unity of Spain and the equality of all Spaniards,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,39.82244,7.2117352,2,thank president ladies gentlemen pnv criticizes government 's management little know united bonds

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,"Thank you President Good morning ladies and gentlemen If I may before I go into this matter I will express something to you in a colloquial tone how does it smell like budgets How it smells like budgets I say this because we are witnessing how some parliamentary groups are already starting to withdraw and withdraw parliamentary initiatives that are contrary to the Government That 's the face of the matter but the one we'd like to know is the other the dark one the one we do n't see In exchange for what have you withdrawn your amendment to this whole unemployment law gentlemen of the PNV Because it 's a law of unemployment In exchange for about twenty amendments as the press says or in exchange for something else How much is it going to cost the rest of the Spaniards to keep their privileges and their uniqueness As you can see with the government of Pedro Sánchez in Spain minorities are governed by a handful of votes that artificially keeps them a few more months in Moncloa Nothing new with the PNV Ladies and gentlemen of the PP check it out As far as the bill before us is concerned the way we see it already starts wrong because it brings the wrong title because from its reading we infer that it is a law of unemployment that regulates unemployment and the public administrations that manage However we do not perceive measures that really aim to generate stable and quality employment with clear and concise proposals this being the priority and nuclear issue in Spain Our amendment to the entire bill which I imagine will have been read or not is presented as a denunciation of the political and philosophical spirit of a sectarian and ideological initiative that we receive in our text with arguments Its bill forms a regulatory framework aimed at an administrative architecture that manages unemployment In the face of what might be expected from an employment law that would promote the growth of quality work the text is limited to presenting insufficient active employment policies in a new framework of institutions to regulate them and which will generate more inefficiencies administrative duplication and unnecessary public spending In this scenario the perversaideology of the Government of Spain permeates the whole normative body posed in which the discrimination between the Spaniards is the protagonist of the labor model it poses The text does not handle a single measure that generates labour market growth or improvements in the protection of Spanish workers Analysis of labour market gaps and shortcomings is vague and imprecise while it does not propose solutions that provide long term answers However we already see every day how the minister applauds herself for the good that according to her the labour market is functioning thanks to her pseudo reform so by giving her a little ink and re-baptised makeup the employment contracts she presumes a stable labour market in which the indefinite contracts multiply Of course Minister you have banned temporary contracts and penalized them That is to say you encourage indefinite recruitment at a time of punishment which does not favour long term contracts but punishes temporary recruitment The stimulus therefore that you offer to indefinite recruitment is a sanction to the other hiring So logically companies are fleeing the penalty It 's a matter of survival and logic You do n't have to be too smart to come to that conclusion Minister Fear and fear of your sanctions are the only incentive you offer companies to carry out indefinite contracts This is what you do rather than promoting an enabling climate based on long term legal certainty and real incentives for stable recruitment That is this Government instead of rewarding excellence punishes disobedience to its impositions Communism manual In this sense companies as you know are bound yes or yes to those contracts called indefinite which does not mean that they will be extended over time or that they will be stable because as you know companies if they cannot bear the costs in addition to adjusting energy consumption also adjust the templates by redundancies unfortunately You know what has raised the bill of light inputs the price of materials and fuel No you do n't know you do n't know because you live in your fantasy world I 'd like to know if you know the pain it brings for any self employed or for any SME to fire a worker Maybe you have no idea why since you 've never hired a worker you do n't even know what it means to fire him We must therefore not look at the name of the contract itself but rather at the actual and actual duration of the contract in the long term I invite you to do that analysis and bring it here to the House one day at a hearing What is the actual duration of indefinite contracts on average which have been formed from their labour reform But the real indefinite ones not those fixed discontinuous ones that you speak of that already exist decades ago and that you have not invented them minister A fixed discontinuity is a temporary contract accumulated in the year nothing more You do n't stop cheating on the loner Bring us that statistics and you will check the reality of the stability of the labour market in Spain I 'll give it to you in advance In view of the impossibility as I said of making temporary contracts to meet temporary needs some companies resort to such indefinite recruitment but days before the end of the probationary period they do not have to pay compensation without the worker The number of people who do not exceed this probationary period has increased I told you two weeks ago by nine compared to last year before its reform came into effect The probationary period lasts between two and six months depending on the position and from July 2021 to July 2022 this case for termination of contracts has increased by more than 900 We will also highlight the overall increase in dismissals due to objective causes by 234.7 voluntary reductions by 258 and involuntary reductions by 320.9 You like the data and I give it to you for study So to a greater extent and as it could not be otherwise this law that we amend today goes in line with its creation of more public bodies which will generate administrative duplication and more unnecessary public spending at a time when the Spaniards do not arrive at the end of the month And of course the gender ideology that has emerged with a breakdown of the labour market in what you call collectives labeling workers for a single trait that curiously almost always coincides with sex or sexual orientation What an obsession you have with this It 's just that it 's tired and sick We say no to the introduction of gender criteria in labour legislation and not to the acritical follow up of the positions of the 2030 Agenda for the sake of a so called new society which is neither new nor society while emphasizing the differences of those who are equal in the assumption of rights responsibilities and freedoms People are people and we all have the same obligations and rights according to that status of person The same rights to have access to a job to have access to education and to have access to health regardless of our exo our beliefs and our race and it is already in our Constitution Therefore your law is clearly discriminatory because rather than ensuring equal opportunities for access to a job what you do is prioritise one another according to whether certain features or characteristics of some people you like more or less than others that is confrontational policies What you call inclusion in fact is exclusion from the sphere of your policies to a part of society Change the concept of inclusion to that of equal opportunities and it will be much better for the Spaniards With regard to the reality of unemployment that you intend to manage with this absurd law see if it will be bad the law that even the unions that you have on pay in your ministry have complained and so they have said you should focus on the data of the unemployment of people over forty five years old which you have mentioned earlier and on those of young people so that they can find a stable and quality job with a remuneration according to their decent qualification that allows the former to maintain a sufficient working life until the retirement age and our young people to work a future By the way it turns out from the law that for you young extolled mainly foreign have priority over the rest another exclusionary inclusion right Look an equique union of its own denounces that long term unemployed people continue to live a drama in our country people around one and a half million who have been seeking employment for more than a year while more than 600,000 have been living for more than four years an alarming figure For this union the solution to this social drama is to improve an insufficient employment law and that has been adopted without social dialogue through the promotion of more effective active employment policies which adapt to the specific reality of each person and achieve a rapid reintegration into work because people who have been unemployed for a long time without the possibility of obtaining a job as you know are caught in a spiral that in addition to compromising their economic survival damages their mental health and therefore diminishes their role in society and their dignity But you give it to me that I hit you with the gender which is what goes for them The bill does not focus on the equality of Spaniards and does not even intend to do so As I have just said these sectors both young and over 45 years of age deserve the priority attention of a responsible and truly committed Government to meeting the needs of those who have the most difficulty finding a job The regulation of a matter as far reaching as employment requires seriousness impartiality and a sense of State in order to be carried out under the appropriate conditions It also requires ambition illusion and will to rid ourselves of this structural unemployment that we suffer in Spain fuelled by a system that has been carried away by the ideological velocities of the left opposed to effort meritocracy hard work and material progression Values such as effort merit and innovation must set out decent employment with the aim of enabling the proper development of entrepreneurship while strengthening the protection of workers and in a corresponding way of

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,"Thank you President Minister even if you do n't believe it I agree with you on one point and it is that our main task is to protect the Spaniards but now from what and from whom should we protect them And here 's the hue the loss of purchasing power Of course Precarity in employment Also But do you know who we should protect the Spaniards from primarily From this government because you are the greatest danger and the main threat to Spain to our economy to our freedoms and to our rule of law and I will justify this by referring you to facts and data Threat to our economy Spain is the only country in the European Union that has not yet reached pre-pandemic GDP levels with a public debt per capita of € 30,000 and a GDP per capita of 25,460 with inflation above 10 and an underlying of 5.5 Threat to our freedoms censorship to which you think differently political violence and two states of alarm of your fist and letter minister declared unconstitutional the greater violation of rights and freedoms to the Spaniards in democracy with the excuse of protecting them as if they were unable to assume their own responsibilities and autonomous kidnapped in their homes to which they were forbidden to work and to whom they have not yet been compensated for expropriating that right to work A threat to the rule of law they closed the Congress their occurrence also minister declared unconstitutional lock with which their government held a concentration of power proper to the dictatorships with the Attorney General of the State at their service the CIS and now the INE and Indra and they assault the institutions of the State and those who cannot attack them pretend to discredit as did their partner the Minister of Decoute and Unemployment with the governor of the Banco de España And how far do they intend to go They whiten the executioners and abandon the victims To mitigate the perverse effects of inflation they invite the Spaniards to turn off the light and not turn on the air conditioning whoever has it while Times Square girls burn fuel in the Falcon and go hiking paid with our taxes What will be the next Minister Are you going to invite the Spaniards to eat twice instead of three times a day And you 're going to do it with another state of alarm to protect them You go along the path of rationing cards because of course you invite the Spaniards to spend less a rule that does not apply to your mastodontic government which continues to waste But of course taking into account the memorable phrases of their feminist ministers one that says that public money is nobody 's and another that says small billions are nothing because with these references we understand their spending policies Advice I do n't have for myself And the royal decree that we propose to validate today together with the Royal Decree Law 6/2022 of which it is extended includes a set of measures that will imply a lower income to the public arks approximately 5825 million However tax revenues up to May have increased from the previous year by 15.5 billion which would triple the impact of these tax discounts In conclusion the Government of P. Sánchez returns only one in three euros of the revenue increase to the Spaniards and the rest is left by the Executive to continue spending without making a single cut in advisors chiringuitos and mismanagement It is the authentic and inimitable government of ruin Ladies and gentlemen a year and a half ago no means of communication or any study service announced the economic effects of Russia 's invasion of Ukraine but what we often heard then was the risk of inflation that the economies were going to face But this government obsessed with euthanasia democratic memory and focused on climate suicide forgot to protect the families from the ruinous loss of purchasing capacity that followed and which you are therefore complicit in I will read you a text that we will publish at the beginning of November 2021 A cost inflation process is taking place due to a supply shock driven by rising energy prices as well as the lack of supply of components and raw materials on international markets without the Government actively addressing it through energy and trade policy instruments in a credible and sustainable manner in the short term in the medium term This is part of the entire amendment tabled by VOX to the 2022 State General Budgets an issue on which we continue to insist as a risk factor for budgets based on an unrealistic macroeconomic picture Look you started taking steps to curb inflation in April of this year two months after the invasion of Ukraine and when you 've subsidized that 20 cents a liter of fuel it 's increased the price by at least 40 cents and when you 've touched the price of light the bill has increased Therefore we are now facing this crisis with the worst imaginable situation We have a debt of 118 of GDP an increase in interest rates and a fragile labour market based on public employment and with growth let 's say fixed or discontinuous Well that 's it Ladies and gentlemen inflation risk has been a fact since the end of 2020 That is why Germany for example dropped VAT massively to contain the rise in prices and despite suffering more virulently from the effects of the war has managed to maintain lower inflation levels than those recorded by Spain This royal decree is the palm show that when they have to face problems they do it late and killing flies to cannons It 's bread for today and hunger for tomorrow And it 's not a topic now it 's a palpable reality socialism first breaks your legs and then gives you a crutch to walk And if not ask the farmers stifled by the increase in costs with a food chain law that is another farce and that does n't work ask the transporters those right wing activists according to you and ask the gas stationers who are sick of financing their magnificent ideas such as that of me

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,You as always in the absurd genre without answering what you asked Well look if in Spain we have unemployment rates that double those of the European Union for example being higher in women and over forty five years old it turns out that their most enthusiastic idea would have a negative effect for companies to hire these people women for example because they will find it more expensive to fire them It is exactly the same plan that you have devised for people with disabilities who have eliminated or plan to eliminate incentives for their recruitment thus creating barriers to their entry into the labour market Do you understand this or do I explain it to you in Latin how is Augusta Emérita 's recent arrival Therefore with these discriminatory proposals we already see how you understand equality violating fundamental rights which is the guiding principle of your Government 's policies Madam Minister you instead of adding up reduce employment opportunities and instead of a public office have become a very heavy burden on the pocket of the Spaniards,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,39.452896,3.9381812,2,always absurd genre without answering asked well look spain unemployment rates double european union example higher women forty five years old turns enthusiastic idea would negative effect companies hire people women example find expensive fire exactly plan devised people disabilities eliminated plan eliminate incentives recruitment thus creating barriers entry labour market understand explain latin augusta emérita 's recent arrival therefore discriminatory proposals already see understand equality violating fundamental rights guiding principle government 's policies madam minister instead adding reduce employment opportunities instead public office become heavy burden pocket spaniards
#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,"Thank you President Mrs Oramas last week in your inquiry the executing arm of the star measure of Podemos Mr Escriva came to tell you that as you voted in favour of minimum living income as you had no right to protest He only failed to respect that the minimum living income has not reached the 2,300,000 people promised because of Putin or because VOX will rule in Castile and León Because this government instead of seeking well being for the Spaniards is dedicated to evangelizing with dogmas of faith pretending that we believe that inflation close to 8 astronomical fuel prices and the bill of light are Putin 's fault or that VOX will rule in Castile and León Because now the payrolls are hybrid half for gasoline and half for electricity And what worries this unworthy government is not that the Spanish have a job with decent wages that they have a home unless they illegally leokupen that people feel safe in their neighbourhoods or that young people have a future this government of shame needs 21.3 billion euros in feminist policies I do n't know what which is actually 21.3 billion reasons for them to resign and leave According to data published in December 2021 the National Social Security Institute has received more than 1 500 000 applications for minimum living income of which 362,000 have been approved with 824 000 beneficiaries accounting for 35 of the 2 300 000 promised ceasing to implement EUR 1 billion of the 3 billion budgeted However for feminist policies I do not know what they will provide 21.3 billion euros And it is that the most emblematic feature of this government is to do just the opposite of what it promises and in the case of Minister Escriva to develop policies contrary to what he himself recommended before going to the dark side And it must be that it has no historical memory because when it chaired the AIReF and presented the study on minimum incomes in 2019 it stated experience shows the complexity of developing these minimum income programmes during the crisis since in practice the effective way to implement them is precisely to do so before the crisis takes place An optimal design is therefore to frame the implementation of these minimum incomes into a medium term budgetary plan which will compensate for the structural increase in expenditure ensure its monitoring and continuous evaluation And with regard to the ongoing evaluation today the AIReF has to present this evaluation in the first half of 2022 and the only thing it finds is the refusal of the Ministry of Finance to be able to sign an agreement with the Tax Agency that allows it to access this data The minimum living income has become a real nightmare for thousands of families who have seen their income drastically reduced by errors in social security calculations A benefit supposedly aimed at preventing the risk of poverty and social exclusion has become a deadly trap for families living on the threshold of begging Mr Escrivá Mrs Oramas also reminded you that you voted in favour of the fifth additional provision and that because of the extraneous singularity of Navarre and the Basque Country things have to be done in a different way because minimum vital income requires the exchange of tax data and since it is a competence of the outlaws they must do so For I remind Mr Escrivá that in the area of information exchange and tax management between the outside finances and social security there are several agreements which must be ignored by him despite being published in the Official Gazette of the State The only truth of the Government 's lie is that it agreed to transfer the full management of the minimum vital income to the Basque Country so that the PNV would not present an amendment to the general budgets of 2022 in full with the aim of ensuring that Mr Sánchez remained screwed to his chair in the Moncloa The rest are lies",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,43.805378,4.969532,2,"thank

#PabloJuanCalvoListe,"Thank you Mr. President I will refer in my speech to the draft amendment of the Organic Law of the Judiciary in the matter of the Commercial Courts whose basic idea is no other than that of residence in these courts the competence to process and resolve all the competitions including those of the natural non-traders objective that we consider correct since the legislative response to the insolvency situations is unique it seems logical that regardless of the circumstances surrounding the competition the judicial competence is also identical This reform will see the light just when the economy of the Spaniards is worse as a result of the failure of this government 's policies and there are aspects of this reform that seem very wrong to us First the amendment to article 83 of the Organic Law of the Judiciary is a capital error Population criteria are established to determine when a province may cease to have Mercantile courts or when a population other than the provincial capital has the right to have its own It has already been said in the Commission that Elche 's case points out very well how wrong the reform is since it has no more than 250,000 inhabitants and is bordering on that of the provincial capital According to the project a city of the industrial importance of Elche could not have its own Commercial Court today In addition the population criterion applies exclusively to municipalities and not to judicial parties which are the territories where jurisdiction extends The difference can be decisive Elche again takes the Government 's reasoning away The correspondents of abandoned Spain intend to deepen the gap and inequality by allowing a province to be deprived of a judicial body We already know that you are more of autonomous communities than of provinces but I must remind you that article 141 of the Constitution states that the province is the territorial division for the fulfilment of the activities of the State and justice is one of them as an expression of its sovereignty What a better element of Spain 's social and territorial cohesion than that which all the provinces have with all the judicial bodies Its plan of measures in the face of the demographic challenge also does not correct it as it does not speak of family or birth only of residence climate change and gender perspective Secondly the Government allows autonomy to undermine the State 's own powers in the area of justice which we find irresponsible and possibly unconstitutional The decision of the Government is conditional on a favourable report from the Autonomous Government Can you imagine what would happen at the door of a negotiation of the General Budgets of the State Conversely what would autonomy say if its laws were to be subject to the approval of the Government of Spain Here the governing body of the judges is emptied a little further to give it on a tray to the autonomies By March 2021 they had limited the powers of the serving General Council to appoint judges On Friday however the PSOE rectified itself but not to correct but to further control justice as it turns out that it will now allow the General Council to elect two Constitutional magistrates That 's right no prior reports and nothing from the Supreme no TSJ no hearings What changed then I 'm telling you the huge judicial mess the government and the PSOE are having This is autocracy we said it VOX was right By the way did you know ladies and gentlemen of Podemos Did you know that ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party Leave judges to choose judges and do not abduct their impartiality Third Competition is also reformed to deal with passengers claims in collective transport which is drawn from the Mercantile courts where complaints are effectively resolved today in favour of the Court of First Instance Tremendous error for the courts of instance already collapsed are going to collapse even further If they must strengthen the courts of the Mercantile somehow do so but not at the expense of moving the competences And fourth and last the reform will be approved out of date This Government considers the model of justice obsolete and intends to implement the model contained in the organizational efficiency project replacing those tried by courts of instance where competences are already reflected in a specific way as here Reasons for legislative technique procedural unity effectiveness and coherence would justify a single project Spain urgently needs an agile and effective justice and Spain also needs a new

public administration and a public official And I can tell you that the whole amendment has nothing that can be reprehensible in the sense that you have said leading us to call us xenophobes and I do n't know what else that I do n't know what it has to do with the subject of the Navarro convention Here what is involved is the real inequality that exists There are autonomous communities that are subject to a common system in which it is the State that dictates the limits in both assigned and own taxes that is how far they can go and there are two autonomys that have their own system in which there is opacity We do not know how the Basque quota is calculated and we do not know how the Navarra contribution is calculated When the minister was a finance adviser to the Junta de Andalucia she told Mr Montoro that it produced inequality and that there could not be that opacity in the calculation of the Basque quota and the Navarra contribution Of course it is very easy when you are in an autonomy where you are seeing that there are inequalities to ask the minister of duty that there be no inequalities and just when the next year they appoint her minister to say that they will fix it because they will do everything with transparency And he insisted on transparency He said Let 's be transparent everyone will know how to calculate the Basque quota and the Navarra contribution Have any members of this House been informed of how the Basque quota is calculated since the amendment of the law was approved in December Or have any members of this House when today we are discussing the amendment of the Law of the Economic Agreement with Navarre been informed of how the Navarra contribution is calculated There 's no one here to find out I do not know where the transparency which this Government presumes is by the way the Government which as I said before is the most opaque in the history of democracy with more than one thousand two hundred resolutions unanswered by the Transparency and Good Government Council I do n't know what they 're bragging about And we have tabled the amendment as a whole and we have opposed direct and single reading because the debate in this Parliament is being stolen once again because nothing prevents it from being handled by ordinary procedure The Constitutional Court has upheld that it is treated in this way it has endorsed it but it does not prevent it from being treated by ordinary procedure And it is not a receipt that we do not have any information that we are presented the text of the bill as all documentation When you ask about those formulas that come to the end of the text on the calculation of the contribution to know on what basis and where they have the economic reports that endorse it you laugh at us and do n't give them to us And when we ask in writing they send us to the ministry 's website to the transparency portal and there 's nothing there 's nothing Where is Mrs Montero that of Andalusia who claimed

#EmilioJesúsDelValleRodríguez,With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to say that my parliamentary group the VOX Group is in favour of the evaluation of public policies provided that its purpose is to analyse and highlight the impact of such policies on issues as crucial for citizenship as the unity of Spain and national sovereignty territorial cohesion and equality between Spaniards the environment and rural Spain the protection of the socio- economically disadvantaged depopulation and the demographic challenge economic growth decent stable and quality employment intergenerational solidarity and the just redistribution of wealth among others while respecting the legal and constitutional order of our nation What we do not agree with is that it should be done in the proposed way creating three new bodies the State Agency for the Evaluation of Public Policies the Higher Evaluation Commission and the General Evaluation Council At present the Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policies already exists in Spain and in our view it is not justified from the perspective of reducing public expenditure efficiency and budgetary balance that what is now an agency is divided into three In parliamentary technique the law is very bad it is very poorly structured and very poorly drafted and it gives the impression that it has been drafted by the gentleman to whom they are going to entrust the management of that agency As I was saying there is now an institute and of course that of being a director of the same institute sounded bad to him and they said let 's put state agency which sounds nicer to be director of a state agency because it does n't make any sense Where appropriate what should be done was to provide the current institute with the necessary resources and to expand or strengthen its powers Currently the Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policy has the following functions which coincide with what is contained in the draft law but are divided into three agencies evaluation of public policies plans and programmes in coordination with ministerial departments promotion of the culture of public policy evaluation preparation dissemination and publication of reports technical documents and other documents of interest and methodologies and evaluation guides training in public policy evaluation and in particular training of public employees in this area in coordination with INAP the instrumental support necessary to carry out the analyses required by the modernization or planning processes that are being promoted and participation in agencies organizations and forums related to the evaluation of public policies with collaborative options Of course it does not contain anything that this should be done with a gender perspective and based on the dogmas of the 2030 Agency which is what you like and then you decide that we need to change it On the other hand the definition made by the current Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policies of the activity and purposes of the evaluation of public policies is also consistent with what is contained in the draft law First the current institute defines the evaluation of public policies as the systematic and reasoned process of knowledge generation from the collection analysis and interpretation of information aimed at the overall understanding of a public intervention whether it be a policy plan program or norm to achieve an evidence based value judgement regarding its design implementation and effects It is literal as it comes in the bill Secondly with regard to the purposes of the evaluation the institute stresses as the draft law also does that the evaluation promotes transparency and accountability of citizens and contributes to the improvement of democratic quality assists in evidence based decision making promotes effectiveness and efficiency in public action by promoting greater rationality of public expenditure serves learning and contributes to the improvement of the strategic and operational dimension of public action and encourages participation in public action In our opinion this bill is one more example of the socialcommunist legislation which loves to create chiringuitos to act as a agency for the placement of friends of the government and hence creates agency commission and advice to place three directors general deputy directors general friends We see no point in it and that is why we have tabled a total of 30 amendments which respond to these four proposals First to make ex ante intermediate and ex post evaluations mandatory for all public policies and to link them to the expenditure monitoring activity of the AIReF Secondly change the criteria of public value final objectives and indicators that will determine the evaluation of public policies and define them in a closed and objective way to avoid their instrumentalization in the service of left wing ideologies and globalist agendas Thirdly to abolish new equipment units or bodies as I said before nothing less than three which is covered by the bill And fourthly to reduce the periodicity of public policy assessment plans that are required of the Government and ministerial departments Well none of our 30 amendments have been accepted in the Commission so we are keeping them alive and we are going to put them to your consideration Mr. President I conclude Once again it is shown that this Government is thinking of the welfare of politicians rather than the welfare of citizens Nothing more and thank

#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,Thank you Mr. President On June 13 1898 the War Revenue Act was passed in the United States a law introducing temporary taxes including inheritance tax to finance the war in Cuba Well that war ended exactly two months later but 124 years later the Americans continue to suffer from the temporary inheritance tax I do n't know why I remembered that when I read today the title of your bill called for the establishment of temporary energy taxes and credit institutions And as the reading progressed socialist ladies and gentlemen I remembered more of that war initiated under a false pretext as was the sinking of Maine because in that war the United States was willing to do anything to gain access to world hegemony A little like Pedro Sánchez today is n't it The politician is willing to anything anyone to access and remain in power The one who was able to agree with those who for months promised that he would not agree the one who cast the political arm of ETA exchange prisoners for budgets returns today to the burden and puts his strict electoral interest before the economic responsibility and the interests of Spain and all the Spaniards Today together with his Marxist partners he brings us to this House an initiative that plans on the unconstitutional that solves nothing that damages the image of Spain that deteriorates legal security that compromises investment and employment and that at the same time you will see how you will end up paying all the Spaniards And they do so through a bill rather than making it as reasonable as it would have been through a bill a trapping process with which they try to avoid public consultation the memory of normative impact and the advice of the Council of State and which results in what was a cacicada from the beginning And let us remember how we have arrived here without listening to any of the sectors concerned without even informing the Minister of Finance today absent he should not be very interested in this initiative and without having made any prior study Pedro Sánchez considered however that it was a good announcement to bring to the debate about the state of the nation I could have used that debate for other things to do some self criticism for example there seemed to be reason for that It is possible that the fact that we were the only country in Europe to raise taxes after the pandemic hit explains that Spain has been released from economic recovery It may be that the fact that we are the only country in the European Union that is not reviewing and is not even considering revising its energy policy has had an impact on triggering energy costs The so called labour counter reform is likely to be connected to some extent with the fact that Spain is the country that has destroyed the most jobs in the second quarter of the year But no this government preferred to avoid any self criticism and return to the mantras we already know Franco virus Putin Franco virus Putin for whatever they think But lately Franco virus Putin is no longer enough to cover up all the clumsiness of the worst possible government at the worst possible time And surrounded by the gloomy reality that of the Resistance Manual decided to pull forward by incorporating a new mantra that of the dark powers gathered in scenes that smoke pure according to him He the president of the government who with the silence shelling complicity and cowardice of many of the greats of IBEX has done and undone has taken editorial and power centers and created the largest customer network in democratic history He now wants to play two bands now with the IBEX and against the IBEX But the result is always the same the impoverishment of the middle and working classes which once again no doubt will end up paying the consequences of their populist drift Because it will be SMEs middle and working classes families who will once again suffer from credit restrictions and the increase in the credit cost resulting from the impact of this bank balance sheet measure It will be these working classes precisely those that will be affected by the impact in terms of job destruction but above all they will carry on their backs the impact of this new rise in taxes Do you remember when I was repeatedly asking the Minister of Finance if she was going to raise taxes Mrs. Montero denied it until three times Do you remember that the socialist government will not raise taxes either to the middle class or to the working class And what came next we already know They did not leave a tax behind but it is that 84 of the tax haven focused precisely on middle and low incomes And this road map to further increase the tax burden on the Spaniards continues even if they try to hide it Measures such as the disaster which has increased the taxation of the sale of houses by 17 the non-deflation of the IRPF which we will talk about later which motivates the Spanish to pay 13 more in this tax until June simply because of the rise in prices and measures such as the one they bring here today because despite the government 's promises the taxes that today tell us that they are going to shut down the bank and the electrics do not fill any doubt that they will eventually be passed on to all the Spaniards Among other things the guidelines of the European Banking Authority the EBA require the bank to set its prices on the basis of the cost structure including tax costs So this rule is telling the Spanish bank not to comply with European regulation I 'll tell them that 's not gonna happen Ladies and gentlemen unfortunately some of those who today feel affected by this rule were silent when the government attacks tourism the car industry or when it attacks the meat industry Some of those who are concerned today and denounce the interventionism of the Government supported the dismantling of our industry decreed by the same Government acting in the name of climate religion Some of those who today demand our support did not give it to us when the education sector was being curtailed SMEs and self reliant people were being marginalized from European funds or red lines were being crossed that a democratic government should never have crossed It is never too late but the economic entrepreneurial and journalistic elites of this country because of their complicity and silence have a lot of responsibility for Sánchez to remain President of the Government Ladies and gentlemen in the devastating economic scenario we are in the last thing we need is new tax increases that put the recovery at risk and sink the Spaniards how Maine sank unnecessarily and under a false pretext to deceive the population about who has the responsibility I am mistaken which is precisely the only thing this Government is doing well Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,41.493782,1.6724623,2,thank mr. president june 13 1898 war revenue act passed united states law

#LourdesMéndezMonasterio,Thank you very much Mr President We will vote in favour of taking this bill into account so that the time of social service that a woman will perform in her day to compute the years assessed for the purposes of partial retirement simply because it is of justice although we do not agree with the amount of stupidity that we have had to hear this afternoon They have insulted ladies and gentlemen they have insulted many women many women who worked whether or not they agreed with that moment that was lived in our country They 've insulted a lot of women who did a service to their country I am not going to go in if I agree or disagree with the Franco administration what happens is that you seem to have brought this initiative in the pure evening and simply to mess with an administration and moreover to provoke a party like VOX but we are not going to get into your provocations Ladies and gentlemen it should also be counted as a contribution to social security for the time that mothers or parents stayed or stayed to take care of their children but not because they considered it to be a heavy burden or burden but on the contrary because they considered the great social value that this represents and it should be possible to do so if the money of the Spaniards were not embezzled in derision as this government does It is contradictory and hypocritical to say that they avoid the negative gender impact according to his lexicon when they have just decreased through the Royal Decree Law 3/2021 the maternity supplement in the retirement pension for mothers with large families In other words they lower their pension penalize mothers who have had four or more children in particular to whom they have contributed most to society to whom they have been more heroic in a country where having a child has become heroic This is his progressive feminism We will table amendments to correct this injustice in the bill that is currently being dealt with By the way while in Hungary women who have had four or more children apart from other benefits are exempt from income tax because they estimate that they have contributed enough to society to pay taxes Yes it is that country in which families are so much helped which has risen its birth rate by 24 in very few years that country which in addition now presides over a woman precisely that which was dedicated to family policies that country to which you and your friends in the European Union demonise to which all consensus progresses demonizes because it is not submissive to its agenda for the destruction of women and therefore for the destruction of the family Ladies and gentlemen what seems rather to be the fact that this motion for a law is now forced by 8 March perhaps to conceal the true horror that has occurred on our streets or perhaps to disguise the division of a movement that has already degenerated in such a way that we are ashamed to share the status of woman with those who say they represent us and appear in a zafia vulgar even obscene violent aggressive way with flags of the sickle and the hammer with a staging that reminds us of other times They want to forget past times rewrite history and however evoke those who inspired by a perverse ideology such as the communist have caused dramatic effects in our country and whose consequences are now being lived in Europe By the way ladies and gentlemen 25 million women did not attend that demonstration Many of us are tired of these sophistications of hatred against man and of being treated as victims A second thought Our pension system is broken and fundamentally it is due to demographic suicide We have lost 1.1 million native Spaniards in the last ten years and it is a great fault for this that the current perverse feminism which has caused great social damage and is causing great personal and family damage a feminism that does not take into account an important part of the female specificity such as motherhood that it has wanted to free itself wrongly from its own nature following the old slogans already ladies and gentlemen old fashioned of Simone de Beauvoir that sex and motherhood enslave it Women have never been as slave as they are today the absolute impossibility of having the children they want the risk of losing their jobs if you become pregnant companies that offer the freezing of eggs because they cannot dispense with work at the most productive age abortion as a solution you have problems to have your child the barbarity of the rental belly the increase of trafficking for sexual exploitation Ladies and gentlemen women have shown that in their professional development they have at least the same capacity as men but ladies and gentlemen unaided conciliation is still the pending subject and many women have left many important things on the way Only in view of the equal value of women and the absolute differences with men can justice be done The woman would have to be a partner of the man in absolute equality of value and in the absolute difference of being in a culture that denies the value of difference according to Mariolina Ceriotti Finally let us reflect on the sustainability of the pension system In the face of a broken pension system the only solution for you is immigration and euthanasia One of the pillars in a distribution system is without a doubt birth Protection of the family and encouragement of the birth of children should be a priority Ladies and gentlemen EUR 21 300 million could be devoted to many urgent needs including supporting the family but this government which brings us misery and ruin decides that it is the gender perspective that must consume EUR 21 300 million EUR 21 300 million to combat hegemonic masculinities How are they going to explain to the Spaniards that now with the spectacular rise of gasoline half of what they pay is tax How are they going to explain that EUR 21 300 million which is what is collected in two years by the gas tax is earmarked for gender policies How do they explain to the Spaniards that the rise of light and gas makes them poorer and the state richer because it collects more with the rise of those taxes,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,42.19607,7.109936,2,thank much mr president vote favour taking bill account time social service woman perform day compute years assessed purposes

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,"Thank you very much Mr President Madam Justice Minister in order to understand what is happening in justice in Spain and to understand whether these budgets are part of the solution or increase the problem it would be important for us to have four clear figures for all Spaniards and I will refer to them on the basis of the last report published by the General Council of the Judiciary which deals with the year 2021 3 144,000 outstanding cases 2,494,000 outstanding executions therefore resolutions that have already been firm that can be put into practice this adds up to approximately 5,600,000 outstanding cases to be resolved by all the jurisdictions and judicial bodies in Spain Our judicial bodies our judges our judges our lawyers in the administration of justice our judicial agents our prosecutors have made an impressive effort and we must thank them because they have resolved more than 6,300,000 cases This represents an increase in resolutions by no less than 21 over the previous year from 2020 to 2021 But it happens Minister that the litigation in Spain has increased and 6 273 000 new cases have entered That is to say that this fabulous work effort of our judicial bodies of more than 21 over the previous year has failed and will not succeed in avoiding that gigantic delay ball that the Justice Administration has We have the chill of an average of 1,000 cases a year per judge which means that every judge has to solve an average of three cases a day and we talk about 365 days and that 's assuming they did n't have a single weekend of rest or a vacation Let us imagine for a moment a magistrate having to settle three divorce cases three creditor competitions or three criminal cases involving serious crimes on the same day That is the unacceptable workload to which we are subjecting our judicial bodies And we should ask ourselves can we continue to demand even more work from our judicial bodies Do we have the right to demand that they solve the problem So where 's the problem Well look one way to find out is to look around and look at what other countries in our environment are doing Here is the last report of the Council of Europe of October 2022 last month which tells us judges and magistrates in Spain 11 judges and magistrates per 100,000 inhabitants when the average of the European Union is 17 almost 80 more prosecutors in Spain 5 prosecutors per 100,000 inhabitants average of the European Union 11 prosecutors per 100,000 inhabitants Let 's talk about money how many euros are spent in Spain for every inhabitant and year 87 euros Here one will be waiting for me now to give a much higher average of the European Union So here is the problem which turns out that in the European Union the average of euros spent per inhabitant per year is much lower 64 euros That is to say we have budgets of more than EUR 2197 million and those budgets which in addition to being ruinous are the budgets of inefficiency do not solve the problem and above all our judicial bodies have to see judgments such as that of the Constitutional Court on 10 October 2022 pointing out undue delays to a judicial body in Seville because it does not resolve sufficiently in time The key where is it Minister You know it well the General Council of the Judiciary this General Council of the Judiciary that you all always want to control among other things to gag and shut up in your report requested at least the creation of 176 new judicial units and you announced to us last year and this one to drum and platter that you are going to create 70 that you do not even cover the loss that there is for retirements and for casualties and therefore there is still more and more deficit of judicial organs You say not with your head but I remind you that you asked for 176 and you have granted them 70 of 176 70 then there are 106 missing Conclusions These budgets are nothing more than the justice that the People 's Party did when it ruled in this it does work perfectly Conclusions First conclusion all of you and the Spanish have already seen it in the data I have given it turns out that we spend more than the average of the European Union and we have fewer judicial bodies to resolve Secondly if we have fewer judicial bodies to resolve we have less capacity to reduce that terrible delay in the resolution and therefore increase the effective judicial guardianship deficit of the Spaniards Thirdly what happens is that it is very poorly spent because the budgets of justice go through the sinking of twelve autonomous communities with twelve competences of justice plus the five autonomous communities that depend on the Ministry of Justice plus the courses of indoctrination in gender ideology plus the judicial bureaucracy that you have created That is the reality of your budgets Minister which are going that way I 'm finishing up Mr. President Question Who are the great losers in these justice

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much Madam President Today several days of vodevil theatre and comedy are ending in which some want us to believe that we were faced with a debate on the general budgets of the State We all know it 's a lie everything was agreed and agreed in those dark offices of infamy and constant betrayal of Spain But now it 's time for the truth We 've seen it now it 's time to go through the box right gentlemen of the government It 's up to you to go through the box as you 've been before the florists handing over the Civil Guard to Navarra Now it is time to pass by the box before the coupsmen of Catalonia and the Basque Country But the traitors never pay for their infamy with their heritage with their interests or with their wealth they always do so with others giving them pieces of national sovereignty pieces of the wealth of the Spaniards pieces of the national territory And this is not as some repeat a blackmail of secessionism because there is a clear will to compromise there is connivance and complicity of the Government to receive in return the benefit of budgets It is a proposal for a law that is a clear fraud of law of book of article 6.4 of the Civil Code because we are presented as a proposal for a law of parliamentary groups which should undoubtedly be an organic bill of a government subject to the controls and reports of the General Council of the Judiciary the Council of State the Fiscal Council the State Advocate It is also clearly a diversion of power because by relying on the powers of parliamentary initiative of parliamentary groups the aim sought is clearly illegal a covert amnesty of the coupsmen and the evident usurpation of the powers of the judiciary in the Constitution And it also seeks to delegitimize delegitimize all those who face the coups those forces and security forces of the State who investigated and faced the violent that popular accusation of VOX who alone sat them on the bench that brave State Attorney General Mr. Maza who rested in peace those Supreme Court Prosecutors who did not kneel before the manipulation and pressure of the new State Attorney General and that Supreme Court Criminal Chamber which although shorter and more cowardly than we had wanted handed down a conviction On the contrary this action of the Government this initiative of its parties what it does is clearly legitimize the coups the violent and their accomplices And the objectives are very clear in application of the principle of retroactivity of the most favourable criminal law reduce the sentences of disqualification of the thugs of those who were convicted of serious crimes of sedition embezzlement and disobedience and also how not facilitate the return return of the escaped cowards from Puigdemont and his accomplices But VOX fulfills VOX said that he would sit you on the bench and sat you on the bench VOX now says that he will again approve in the Penal Code the crimes of sedition rebellion and embezzlement that all of you from the bench of treason to Spain are going to repeal and we will do so by strengthening the mechanisms of the State so that the coupsmen will have it more and more difficult That is why this very week we have recorded a proposal to strengthen precisely that authority that official that member of any government that incites insists collaborates or facilitates a coup d'état be condemned and moreover that loses the Spanish nationality if not of origin anyone that facilitates the rupture of the Spanish nation or that favors the outrages to Spain and its offenses This debate is a great opportunity to repeat,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,39.90828,8.581898,2,thank much madam president today several days vodevil theatre comedy ending

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much Mr President Obviously we reject the proposal and reject the form of its processing a direct and urgent procedure which in essence violates the possibility of a hearing procedure that should have passed if it had been presented not as a proposal but as a draft law Hearing among others in the associations of judges and prosecutors in the so called European Commission for Democracy by Law or Commission of Venice and in the General Council of the Judiciary itself Therefore this urgency could be described as a very clear premeditation and lightening they lack the night although they will soon also achieve it Basically all you want is for this shame to pass quickly to democracy this shame to the state and this shame to judicial independence But the Spaniards will soon know that there are other ways of doing things respecting the powers of the State respecting the division of powers and respecting the judges and magistrates in the legitimate exercise of their power Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,38.232193,9.874577,2,thank much mr president obviously reject proposal reject form processing direct urgent procedure essence violates possibility hearing procedure passed presented proposal draft law hearing among others associations judges prosecutors called european commission democracy law commission venice general council judiciary therefore urgency could described clear premeditation lightening lack night although soon also achieve basically want shame pass quickly democracy shame state shame judicial independence spaniards soon know ways things respecting powers state respecting division powers respecting judges magistrates legitimate exercise power thank much
#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much Madam President Minister you have started your speech by saying that you believe in Parliament in parliamentarianism Really Why did they close this Parliament so that we could not control their fraudulent declared alarm states thanks to VOX in cons ti ti cio in the -em Why is your mouth filled by saying that you respect Parliament if you are then willing to hand it over to those who just do n't believe in anything that comes out of this Parliament because they want to set up their separatist sovereign parliaments You then said Minister that this Parliament represents Spain Man let me do a math represent the Legislative Power Spain is much more There is also a judicial power which is not in here and an executive to which this Parliament should control although unfortunately as you together with the People 's Party have devoted yourselves to carrying out any kind of division of powers this Parliament has no real capacity to control the different executives But Spain is much more Spain is his story Spain is millions of Spaniards who because of people like you do not feel represented in this House because you have created an absolute separation between fiction and real politics Spain which is in the fields in the markets in the workshops in the queues of unemployment that Spain the real Spain which is cold because of its negationisms and its policies of absolute climate fanaticism at the expense of foreign powers that Spain which is cold or cannot put air conditioning by its policies does not feel represented in this Parliament You say that we are committed to repeating over and over again that there is a very serious problem a very serious threat and a very serious risk of breaking up national unity But do you think there 's only one Spanish including you who does n't see it He says that this problem as you have defined it of separatism of Catalans of so called Catalan leaders has already been overcome You said It 's been overtaken But who told you that Otegi Ruffian Because they are achieving their goals through Moncloa through conditioning the Government of Spain Minister you say and you boast because we have heard it here many times and we have heard it from Sánchez who thanks to you was able to protect many workers in the pandemic How many It will be for those who did not stay on the road unfortunately because of their negligence for those who did not lose their lives because you were unable to put the sanitary means in time because you dedicated yourselves to denying reality and when we had it on it was late for many of them Are you referring to the thousands who lost their jobs by fraudulent states of alarm in which you forbade them from exercising their work Because you decided that only certain jobs were essential as if bringing bread home was not essential for every worker You have repeated Minister in the speeches preceding this inquiry and in your own reply to the inquiry between sixteen and eighteen times the word ultra-right Then you are those of the talent those of the tone the educated gentleman the minister I 'd be very easy to get up here and answer one by one to those seventeen times It would suffice me to say that speaking of ultras high treason is what you represent the ultra futility to solve the problems of Spain is what you represent the ultra cowardice to confront the enemies of Spain is what you represent In short they represent the ultra left very well But do you know what 's going on That what concerns us are the problems of Spain not

#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,Thank you very much President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Madam First Vice President of the Government and Minister for Economic Affairs We will discuss the Business Creation and Growth Bill The truth is that you who are so fond of propaganda in the end you have appropriated it in the expression Create and Growing Law that the same applies to what concerns us at this time as to a law of birth promotion A law with which I imagine you will try if approved to transmit to the population that practically from tomorrow Spain is Silicon Valley and nothing is further from reality The law they propose is a collage of reforms You in a text amend eleven laws and a real legislative decree and what you do in the background is change fifty eight rules between articles and provisions and by the way create a couple of observatories which never come wrong for friends In order to promote the business climate Minister legal and economic security is important and its latest actions in Indra through SEPI and its lack of respect for the goodness of statistical information do not go in that direction We 'll see if this affects us among investors Then there 's the language You always use corrupt language They talk about entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship because they find it difficult to use the word enterprise and entrepreneur It is not the same as an entrepreneur as an entrepreneur because what we need is not people with initiatives only that that is an entrepreneur we need an entrepreneur that is an entrepreneur who also risks his assets As I have told you it is practically a law of cuts where you update corporate commercial financial and register aspects In the end which has been the most important they have made a constitutional fit of the problem that we had with the law of market unity and that is why they will get the support of the independence groups They present as a star measure the possibility of creating a company with 1 euro and they miss what is important The minimum social capital in an economic non-legal sense is not 3000 euros or raise them it is the minimum investment that the entrepreneur needs to make It is true that the law requires it to be 3000 if it wants the form of society The entrepreneur could already perfectly make that minimum investment below 3000 what happens is that then he could not have the corporate form And why did he take the corporate form For two reasons that we totally forget One to delineate his patrimonial responsibility that is so that his personal and family heritage would not be affected by society This could have been achieved by allowing individual entrepreneurs a delimitation of their professional assets that was the limit of what they could lose if they failed And the second reason why you were doing it you know was because of a tax problem because there is a strong tax arbitration between declaring income tax when you have an economic activity by natural persons that by corporations Basically what you do n't solve is a problem that Bertrand de Jouvenel warned us about in The Ethics of Redistribution in 1951 You are asking the individual entrepreneur when it would not be necessary to do so it would be much better if you allowed the individual entrepreneur to be an individual entrepreneur On the other hand you say that you eliminate the 3000 euro requirement but it is not true because you put an implicit endorsement in the members rule to society The other issue is lateness Morosity is not solved by creating observatories I understand that someone will put you there but no Neither with sanctions nor putting problems to public procurement for those who have some outstanding obligation really it is solved with incentives and we have proposed many incentives during this legislature The universal application of the cash criterion for the settlement of income company and VAT taxes It only pays taxes what is charged and only deducts what is paid Public morals do n't even treat it He 's been told several times and even his partners have put it in his face Public lateness seems to exist but you might well if the state of the art permits create a single taxpayer account for which we could charge against any debtor balance of an Administration the obligations we had regardless of which adversary was That would indeed be a country project for the Reconstruction Transformation and Resilience Plan yes sir to create a system of multilateral compensation for all taxpayers against all public institutions For the umpteenth time they promote the unique windows Well what are we going to tell you but let 's hope the e-government works Minister because it 's not working Market unity requires value to believe in Spain as a project You have a very large part in this House that does not believe in the unity of Spain as a project and therefore it is impossible for that to work Business financing requires less mistrust of those who ask for money and then there is the bureaucracy The bureaucracy which you some have told you have failed to solve reduces the productivity of our companies lowers wages and generates part of the inflation differential that Spain has Some of the inflation is of monetary origin the fault of the European Central Bank and another we are not going to deny it is due to external events but another part is purely of this government and of the previous governments because of the many obstacles that Spanish companies have to operate You are the last you lose everything and you are also the last in employment which was the only thing you lacked unlike Nadal you are really your reverse and as you are demonstrating with your last maneuvers you have very wrong to lose What Spain needs I conclude president is that the government respects the law and interferes less in the activities that requires less taxes and social burdens that liquidates the taxes according to the current of charges and payments that eliminates tax arbitration between natural and legal persons and limits the property responsibility of individual

#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I would also like to say good afternoon to the Minister because I believe that in the debate on a bill of this importance it should be We have come to debate and probably to approve because you have seen the good climate in the Committee on the Economy always and with this rule there has been in a very special way the draft of a new law on the securities market which would be the third in the history of Spain The first of 1988 has provided very good services to society to the nation and has arrived here in some way because as you know it is part of the current one which is a consolidated text the Royal Legislative Decree 4/2015 The text we are proposing now as Mr Capdevila has reminded us involves the transposition into Spanish law of five directives from the European Parliament and the Council The last in fact was approved on the 14th so we have not only been up to date with the delays that we were having but we have moved forward I do not know if from the right to the European Union In addition as stated in the explanatory statement of the project which is now being put to the vote a number of subjects have been identified that required updating and modernisation with the aim of improving the competitiveness and attractiveness of Spanish securities markets enhancing their entrepreneurial financing capacity always with the maximum guarantees for the investor This means moreover that the law will no longer be the Securities Market Act to receive a new name it will be the law of the securities market and investment services I do n't intend to bore you with the content The law is very prolific has ten titles 367 articles and 27 provisions of various kinds However I would like to draw your attention to the fundamental mission of a financial system because this law together with the Law on the Ordination Supervision and Solvency of Credit Entities 10/2014 and the Law on the Ordination Supervision and Solvency of Insurance Entities 20/2015 constitute the basic regulation of a financial system The fundamental mission of a financial system is to capture the surplus of so called surplus economic units usually mature families to apply it in favour of deficit economic units usually young families and businesses and for a few decades the Administration This process of fund raising and implementation requires intensive work by financial intermediaries and has two purposes One on the one hand is to adapt the risk and term preferences of the savers to the investor 's financing demands because they are often opposed preferences which is known as the process of financial transformation and on the other hand to increase as much as possible the flow of savings aimed at productive investment which is called the process of financial maximization and all this to achieve the greatest and most efficient allocation of resources available to an economy in this case the Spanish one In this sense the draft law that we are debating today together with the regulation that I spoke about before the banking and insurance institutions constitutes a very good regulation of the Spanish financial system I dare say However I wanted to warn you of the risks that exist so that good regulation does not achieve the desired objectives which are two First legal uncertainty and then the application of savings to consumptive expenditure Ladies and gentlemen the legal uncertainty in Spain does not derive so much from the actions of our courts they work reasonably well not even from the excessive regulation and intervention of many authorities that interfere in business decision making processes Nor do I talk to them about the legal uncertainty of changing regulations I speak to you of the lack of respect for the law with capital letters and of the legal uncertainty generated by a State in a situation of constant questioning as if a teenager in vocational crisis were being treated although after the forty it is difficult to understand this type of behavior The application of savings to the financing merely of the expenditure that others cannot meet today does not lay the basis for any growth or I am afraid that of the recovery of the borrowed capital at least in terms of the capacity of the purchasing power i.e. discounted inflation It makes no sense gentlemen for savers to give up current consumption if they are not assured within what is insurable when we talk about the future of a real increase in their future consumption And it cannot ensure such a real increase if capital is not largely devoted to productive investment i.e. if an efficient allocation of resources is not made And public debt is not much less a productive investment except in some very small cases In the last five years the financing capacity of families and in part of businesses has been in spite of everything frankly high The Spanish have saved almost 200,000 million euros which have not been enough to finance the nearly 300,000 that public administrations have needed That is why we have needed another 200,000 from the European Central Bank to meet that deficit of financing for public debt and to reduce our international financial position This is a good law for regulating securities markets and investment services which together with the laws on the management supervision and solvency of credit institutions and insurers assure us a good financial system However ladies and gentlemen you have to be careful because high end vehicles do not work well in the desert they serve no purpose Arrived here I wish you happy holidays at which we celebrate Christmas the birth of the Redeemer the only one who can redeem us I wish you the best in the year 2023 in all respects except the election and thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,38.773914,6.532072,2,"good afternoon ladies gentlemen would also like say good afternoon minister believe

#RubénSilvanoMansoOlivar,Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I was already surprised that we are not basically dedicated to lying which is what the left has dedicated itself to What did you say That he rescued himself at the bank But listen all that Sareb bought were seven savings fruit boxes from the merger in turn of savings boxes a subsidiary bank of a savings bank and a very small Galician bank nothing more Not a single asset was purchased from an anonymous partnership like depository only from those that had the form of foundation savings banks run by all of you Mrs. Garrido it 's not la FROB it 's the Sareb but it 's the FROB Neither is Luis Guindos but is Luis de Guindos And I 've been surprised by some things For example Mr Matute has told us One day we will have to make the hard heads of some understand that public intervention in the economy is necessary Mr Matute I see you are not in the room I do not know how you intend to make my hard headed understanding that public intervention in the economy I see that you are sorry is necessary I do n't know how you intend to do it I hope it 's not with the methods we 're used to That being said we do not dispute that the Sareb is public we have always said so I said in December 2012 that the Sareb was public regardless of the financial engineering operation that Mr. De Guindos had designed so that it would not compute as public debt and deficit In the end the European Union ended up giving reason to the treaty makers that we maintained that position That is why Mr Martínez Oblanca although I fully agree with you in what you have said to this bench which forgets the disaster in which you left the numbers to this other one what is true is that Mr De Guindos tried to deceive the Spaniards with a financial engineering operation so that he will not compute as public debt all the indebtedness of the Sareb On the other hand there seems to be something completely unnoticed here that you Mrs Garrido have put in your explanatory statement which is that the Sareb bought the assets at an overprice of EUR 18 billion He paid 18 billion euros more and so it was impossible for the accounts to fit that great manager who is Mr. De Guindos How are you going to get a 15 return by paying 18 billion more than the assets are worth That 's completely impossible You have n't said anything but I think there 's a lot to investigate Let 's keep going Our position is that we do not share the political control to which they want to subject the assets of the Sareb because in the background it is to affect more of the same As I have told you many times before the Sareb is but a century that served to sustain the prices so that the bank that is would not be dragged away by a fall in its assets Here the bank was not saved as you have said the Deposit Guarantee Fund was basically saved which had collected deposit insurance premiums and had no money to deal with the commitment it had as a public institution vis -à vis depositors We believe in the principle of subsidiarity We do not believe at all that the state has to provide us with everything We understand that the State is the guarantor but not the provider For example in food and clothing sectors to which you attack a great deal we are phenomenally crowded without the intervention of the State Do you understand The same applies to telephone and consumer electronics and it could be with many more things if they abandoned their ideological mantras By the way the principle of subsidiarity is not a fad it is in the Maastricht Treaty Of course they already understand that we are going to oppose this because indeed Mr Matute we do not have so much interventionism in our heads Look at the disaster that Sareb has brought us By the way if I had bought at the prices I had to buy according to the European Union it would have benefits right now That is much of the guilt comes from the design of the operation that was originally made The extension of the functions of the State beyond those of their own leads us only to economic collapse and of the entire productive system You continue to insist that we are going phenomenal but we spend our lives boasting of increased care spending,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,45.9302,3.395128,2,good afternoon ladies gentlemen already surprised basically dedicated lying left dedicated

#VíctorGonzálezCoelloDePortugal,Thank you very much Madam President The PNL proposed by Unidad Podemos constitutes a new and demagogic attack on the foundations of an economy the Spanish one capable of creating wealth employment and well being for all In this the initiative of the communist formation differs only from the socialist one in the intensity of the fiscal voraciousness that characterizes the partners of this government They are determined to expropriate the fruits of the effort and talent of Spanish families and companies It is surprising that a party sitting on the Council of Ministers is proposing on its own a change in the Spanish tax system This only shows the absolute chaos in which the Government is immersed and its absolute lack of consistency It can be assumed that the socialist silence in the face of the initiative of its partners is in agreement with it although for tactical reasons it does not consider it appropriate to support it at the moment But what is serious is not as Mrs Calviño has suggested that the situation does not recommend raising taxes what is serious is the philosophy underlying the Puemita proposal They want to annihilate the already damaged incentives of the Spaniards to work save and invest They want to turn us into subjects of tax exploitation at the service of the ideological delusions of the left This is due not only to an overwhelming economic ignorance but also to a rampant demagogy whose goal is only one to destroy the market economy and to impoverish the Spanish The United Nations GNP We can reflect a deep ignorance of a tax system the Spanish which first of all has one of the highest levels of progressiveness in the OECD secondly the marginal rates of the IRPF apply from much lower levels of income than those in all Western economies thirdly the Spanish companies bear a tax pressure that is 27.2 higher than the European Union average and 21 higher than the OECD average and fourthly the taxation on assets in Spain is 40.8 higher than the European Union average and 38 higher than the OECD average This is the reality Here 's the data This is the information on the tax competitiveness index of the Tax Foundation an organization founded in 1935 therefore nothing to do with Franco Mr Echenique The social communist coalition is turning Spain into a fiscal hell in a place where work savings and investment are considered crimes of lesser majesty by the ruling majority and the PSOE is the enthusiastic travel companion complicit of the communists on the road to the consolidation of a tax system confiscation unjust and why not say so deeply immoral And not content with this they want to deepen in that direction which would worsen the serious problems of the Spanish economy and especially of the people who have less Unido Podemos and its coalition partners are not interested in improving the living conditions of the most disadvantaged sections of Spanish society of those most in need and it must be recognized that their GNP is consistent with this strategy They prefer that the poor be poorer so that the rich are less rich so that the Spaniards become hostages of a left that in a magnanimous way will distribute transfers and subsidies to them to those who snatch the fruits of their effort that is their resources In short chavismo for pure sale The proposal of the tax genocide proposed by the United Nations We can only lead to depressing the rate of savings and investment to encourage the exit of high value added financial and human capital and therefore to intensify the slowdown of an economy that has not emerged from the crisis and is increasingly moving away from recovery and increasingly from our European partners The initiative will not bring any significant change to the better for the Spaniards with greater economic problems those most in need because there is no collection capacity almost zero His whole policy is based on deception and lies on confronting some Spaniards with others on generating resentment on appealing to the lowest passions of the human being and on an encyclopedic ignorance of the consequences of the measures they propose The productive sectors of the Spanish economy can no longer withstand suffocating fiscal pressure Its conception of the tax system is that of a farm in which the role of citizens and businesses is only one to be organized to serve their interests and the delusions of politicians That is why my group will vote against your proposal When the Spaniards give us their confidence and we reach the government VOX will propose a tax reform that allows citizens to enjoy the fruits that are earned honestly by their effort and their talent and companies to be competitive to generate wealth and employment employment and wealth In the meantime Mr Echenique we will fight with all our strength and with all our energy your tax policy on burned land Thank you very

#VíctorManuelSánchezDelReal,I would n't stay calm when we 're talking about something as serious as 4040 million euros that the Spanish of all kinds and conditions generously contribute the rich the poor the mid-pensioners everyone contributes to the 4 billion We are being proposed here a bill to which we have already tabled an amendment to the whole of which was based on three or four things First of all we do not think that Spain 's sovereignty is being transferred to undefined third institutions This about global governance we do n't know who it is we do n't know who they have chosen we do n't know where they meet we do n't know who they serve exactly Secondly because of the emptiness of this law This law does not adequately regulate two issues the change of FONPRODE and how this money will be managed Thirdly for the duty of protection We are presenting an amendment as a whole I think it is still legal in this democracy to present an amendment as a whole and you have taken off with statements about this absolutely deplorable group We had this conversation and then you did n't want to give me a reply there you are with your political courage However the PNV also tabled an amendment in its entirety and did not tell them any of that How curious that the rules here are different depending on whether you are more friendly or more necessary This rule is not what it should have been Minister this rule does not focus on humanitarian aid and cooperation as it should have done Kabul September 2021 or in a few weeks probably on the border between Ukraine and Moldova or between Ukraine and Poland Because of the ideological priorities given to this law do you really believe that people were coming to Kabul or will they get to the border to try to catch the last plane with the notes of the last course of feminism Do you think that someone by collecting the last things in Lvov or in a small town in Ukraine is going to take the last book of the vulva self perception talk that might have given you Spanish cooperation Do you really believe that these are the priorities that Spain should have in the world in cooperation and in humanitarian aid Hunger thirst cold and education of truth the truth that of mathematics that of science that of history that of language That we should have been and should have been the priority of this law but no you prefer to hand over Spain and privatize because this privatizes An NGO does not cease to be a private entity You who have this aversion to the private decide that NGOs are not private they are something else they are kind of a strange hybrid No they 're private entities Look I 'm not disrespecting you They 're very laudable I love the private just like I love the public but this of some yes and however as has already been said close the door to companies If we are going to have to face hunger cold or lack of energy it turns out that we have Spanish companies some public companies that could be helping the cooperation to develop energy agriculture or water projects But no What a coincidence It is better to ideology and privatize that yes always for those closest to you Minister I do n't know if it 's settled if you sleep well I do not know whether this law meets the criteria of being at the service of Spain of its security of its citizenship of democracy based on the Constitution and not on the ideas of the part If it 's too simple We have a book that is the Constitution I am not going to read it calmly because I will not be given the two minutes that have been given to the previous speaker despite the interruptions I have had We base our cooperation on this in the defence of the Spanish Constitution If you want to cooperate with your ideas I invite you to fundraising and make the cooperation you want we can do so too because there is freedom But the public which is of all let us do what is of all which is the Constitution I 'm on my way Minister there is also the one with whom because you have fallen into decentralized cooperation which will bring inefficiency high risks for the cooperators themselves and above all nation risks because if the false Catalan embassies were already a risk for Spain,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,40.540516,7.4727435,2,would n't stay calm 're talking something serious 4040 million euros spanish kinds conditions generously contribute

#VíctorManuelSánchezDelReal,Minister good morning You did not have to lie or disrespect the third political force in this House You did n't have to I am concerned about your lack of respect but I am also concerned about the lack of respect for millions of Spaniards with whom we are speaking you pride yourself on your representation without having it and lack respect for them That you lie to me does n't matter to me our group does n't care and many Spaniards do n't because we 're going to report their lies systematically Minister I had another tone in my speech but you are so cowardly that you have not even been able to mention the group that is presenting this amendment Yes the VOX Parliamentary Group has tabled an amendment in its entirety because this bill in some of its aspects goes against the national sovereignty of Spain which you should represent Minister liar and faulty I repeat it completely changed the tone of my speech for a few minutes What 's going on That the amendment to the entire PNV a few days ago would not have been subject to the same insults and falsehoods that you have launched What 's going on That the PNV is not against cooperation because it has tabled a full amendment which it withdrew on Wednesday Ah Ah That what you like is negotiation in the dark and small offices What 's going on That parliamentarianism has died in Spain That we can't come to Parliament to discuss the laws Is that against something Minister Is that going against something Do n't take it so personally You are not so great that we are against you or your Government We 're in favor of a lot of things You have not even been able to listen to what we have said in the Commission He did n't even dignify himself His team which is probably the one who does the dirty work to get these things out has not been worthy to listen to us because among other things in this law there are at least five ideas that VOX first raised You 're going to sleep tonight supporting a law that probably takes five ideas that we were the first to put forward There she is I had a fucking team because I doubted will this man introduce her It is that we have four foreign ministers in the government of Don Pedro Sánchez four You do not need to stand up and teach us but you too as so many ministers of this Government probably have the expiry date set Four foreign ministers four promises four changes in the approach to Spanish cooperation And you say we can't have our own opinion If we do not know the opinion on the cooperation that the government of Pedro Sánchez will have next year Four different ministers with four different approaches to cooperation I wish you very much to remain in office that is within a government that lasts as little as possible because we are not going to become too generous either In addition this comes for discussion and we are presenting a whole amendment of course And I repeat that you have not had any insults or disrespect towards the PNV which represents many less Spaniards and with whom you will have negotiated something you will tell us at some point in this debate what it has been when and how to withdraw your amendment altogether because something has been negotiated Or do you think that the PNV withdraws something for free It 's just come on I remind you that you are the Minister of Foreign Affairs of all Spaniards even those you hate and those who lack respect Yeah yeah yeah In his sustained and 'sustainable words in appearances he has said rather unpleasant things because he says that we are not in solidarity because he says that we do not give our time because he says that we have not played our lives being in those operations or cooperative missions It 's just that you have n't even looked at our résumés it 's just that you have n't heard from where we 've been or where we 've played the skin of many of those in this parliamentary group by cooperating on the ground not from the comfortable chair of the ministry I 'll go to that later because since you insult let 's review another insult Commission for International Development Cooperation I ask what 's the point Because you Minister have disrespected your colleagues in the groups that support you This procedure will be carried out by another Commission the Foreign Affairs Committee What 's going on That you 're right We proposed that development cooperation should be integrated into foreign affairs and you give us reason but you lack respect for your colleagues your partners and your companions By the way there are very good people in that Commission outside the enormous ideological distances we have There are very good people and very good people and you do n't stop disrespecting them and leaving them for no reason They give me a little tenderness because we may not agree on some details but we do agree on the bottom I repeat do not disrespect millions of Spaniards by saying that we do not want solidarity that we do not want to remove hunger in the world that we do not want equality for all and that we do not want freedom for all Do n't disrespect us including your comrades Going into detail we tabled an amendment to the whole because after twenty five years you fail You do three things in this law The first is that you of course without competence and we will see that without having a category for it sell Spain 's national sovereignty to international entities that do not even define correctly There are concepts like global citizenship global public goods can you show me your global citizenship card Can you show me the record of ownership of those global assets Who do they belong to Oh no they 're in the clouds as that cloud observer will always remind us This is a serious matter and therefore we are presenting an amendment of the whole that could have been read It 's two pages Minister it was n't much effort it was n't much effort Instead of reading the speech he was given I could have read it I have tabled an amendment in its entirety A bit of a game to which he makes an amendment to the whole I 'm sure PNV 's read it to her It speaks of global governance It says the construction of global democratic governance What 's the matter with you Is this Parliament going to disband the brave with this law and will it deprive us of the right to represent the Spaniards here which is the only place where national sovereignty resides It is that that is the point one of our amendment to the whole that you are taking away national sovereignty from us But it just does n't belong to you National sovereignty is not questionable even if its partners discuss it Sovereignty resides in the Spanish people the only depositary represented by the way in the General Courts And on top of that you take in world mantras I think you read little because just read what the UN says about some of the elements that you say are fundamental It says the United Nations and I quote The agenda its agenda implies a common and universal commitment however since each country faces specific challenges in its quest for sustainable development States have full sovereignty over their wealth resources and economic activity and each will set its own national goals You 've invented a new kind of cateto the global cateto I 'm gonna do a soccer simile It 's the cat that goes to the Champions or the World Cup gets excited and when you ask what has been brought answers Well look I 've brought the referee 's t- shirt the corner 's flag and I 've been signed the rules That instead of coming in with the national shirt perfectly represented You like so many others are not representing Spain 's national interests as the UN says So what 's going on That this new global cathet passes through the meanders of the terms and norms that may have been designed well intentionally in a global or globalistic way but that do not necessarily apply to a country like Spain Because you Minister just as you do n't like a lot of Spaniards you do n't seem to like Spain either Here they rely on a few obviously on those who do not like Spain or the Spanish but also on some who so long as they are accepted in the club of progress are capable of anything This PP which is getting whiter and more moderate continues to be delivered to the 2030 Agenda happy to have entered that club at the time This global and globalist catechism empties us of sovereignty to impose ideas and instead of looking at what we can do with what we have and going out there to help free and equal citizens like the Spaniards we are dedicated to importing agendas and objectives This is very funny because the second reason why we are going against this bill is not because of its technical aspects if I had read our amendment as a whole I would know but because you have invented globalist neocolonialism You intend to impose a global agenda on citizens of other countries who have not yet fallen into the trap This is pure colonialism This bill literally says that Spain has to impose a number of ideas on other countries Well no that 's not what cooperation is about and we all know that we 've been on the ground The word cooperation comes from an Indo European language and the prefix co means all together cooperate and all the words that begin with co go around That does not mean that you take the ideas that others have dictated to you and will distribute them throughout the world with this new compulsory and necessary religion in which if you are not you cannot even submit an amendment to the whole even if it is a right of parliamentary groups Not happy with that that ideology becomes very fun Then you have the right to reply and I have another turn but I want to talk to you about this Minister vulva to vulva Instead of talking about hunger instead of talking about water and thirst instead of talking about housing we go to Tegucigalpa with the logo of Spanish cooperation with the logo of the Kingdom of Spain and with the logo of the ministry to which the vulva speak among them Minister really From vulva to vulva do you think this helps a single human being Not only that but above the web where this is you are so unconscious that you have even named the assistants So we have told all Tegucigalpa on top of the logo of the Kingdom of Spain who are the poor trans who have come in confidence to our vulva workshop Do you think that 's serious We will talk later on about other aspects and fundamentally we will talk about the relationship with anti-democratic regimes But above all I wanted to say that Spain 's national sovereignty does not belong to you it belongs to all the Spaniards specifically represented here a law cannot deliver it and less to become the new colonial distributors of this religion of gender space and environment that you want to impose on us We 're still talking Minister,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,39.94773,11.820049,2,minister good morning lie disrespect

#VíctorManuelSánchezDelReal,Don Felix Bolaños you 're here are n't you You are so politically supportive that you cancel a parliamentary question because theoretically you had something to do elsewhere Are you Don Félix Bolaños the minister Yeah Do n't you He tells me not with his head It 's just that I have to ask the minister Minister of propaganda and public illustration I never thought we 'd miss Don Iván Redondo a great professional I never thought we would have to review once again all that you have done in order not to maintain the independence or impartiality of Spanish Broadcasting Yesterday we had a debate which you missed on a proposal which did not advance by the way congratulations on the bravery of the PP abstaining to ensure that there was greater control over Spanish Television and the EFE Agency Today it seems to be courageous courageous ministers who avoid questions about whether a referendum will be held in coordination with their partners in Catalonia That has not been answered because you have neither courage nor political courage What have you done with Spanish Television When I say you two I mean the two bands a rather absent one We 've had decades of sectarian television We have suffered Rosa María Mateo and as she defined her horrific television She was a temporary administrator but in the end we had her for months and months by the way unforgettable afternoons and mornings of glory we had in the control sessions We suffered from the ridiculous process of choosing counselors The Four Pes PSOE People 's Party Podemos and PNV chose their advisors and ignored the list ascending to those who had suspended to whom a committee of experts who lacked respect had chosen for their merit and ability and ascended you the four pes to the most clumsy to the most useless to those who did not cross the line But of course if that 's what you do to choose your public representatives how are you not going to do that too to control Spanish Broadcasting Then we have suffered a certain Pérez Tornero aka the Brief kneeling at his service who has suffered the torpedoing from within the coup d'état from within first of the partners of the fourth pe that of Podemos by the way it is the one who has the least qualification and qualification in these matters but also we have discovered recently the torpedoing of the PSOE itself We have suffered from their blemishes minister yours yours minister of propaganda Because what independence is that of the visits to Moncloa by the president of Spanish Broadcasting Is that independence Who is the president of Spanish Radio Television depending on If you visit Moncloa then that 's it It 's already up to you is n't it How many have there been in these weeks Who 's he meeting with What have you had to do with those visits Why have you also visited a councillor now temporary president at Moncloa headquarters Is ham good Are the beers good Or were you putting your hands on Spanish Radio The four people announced that this was in favour of independence Are you doing as always a plumber and kneeling down to play the Spanish Television pipes I 'm afraid so These courts are the ones that appoint councillors and presidents although then you pact in the dark and dirty offices And now above until new provisional president by royal decree by royal decree you consolidate the coup d'état on Spanish Television giving full powers to the new provisional president So Minister of State Propaganda please explain to me as requested by this inquiry what steps you will take to ensure independence and impartiality I will try not to laugh we will try not to break our breasts of laughter or cry for the lies that you are going to tell us because it is obviously neither independent nor impartial Do n't put that face on me it makes me soft it makes me soft It becomes small soft like cotton But yes we already know that they are their mirrors of azabache that their eyes are hard because you are increasingly tougher in your propaganda Every day we have more and worse propaganda I repeat I never thought I would miss Ivan Redondo because you have returned to an ancient crude propaganda that of I 'm going to control the medium and so That we are in the 21st century do something more modern It 's that of controlling the medium because that they did when the first Spanish Television broadcasts in 1938 that I said yesterday with Telefunken That 's what Germany did in 1938 The founders of Spanish Television Spanish Radio and EFE are what they did controlling the media

#JuanJoséAizcorbeTorra,Mr. President thank you very much These are times of darkness and uncertainty of fears and pre-powers Minister you in the purest leftist style that has been imposed as a dogma of sapphire behavior in this House threatened VOX a short time ago with the following sentence if VOX were to rule they would have massive strikes and mobilizations It was not a distracted warning to navigators but a statement of intentions where it is made clear who commands in the subsidized class unions in Spain turned into tools at the service of the political interests of the left Madam Minister language modifies thought indeed and you only because of this altar threat to the purest Long Knight style that you like so much to justify the negative vote to this labor reform to which we have opposed from the first moment for clear and obvious reasons in form and substance In shape Once again the Government resorts to the misuse of article 86 of the Spanish Constitution and to the figure of the royal decree- law as did the People 's Party at the time by curtailing legislative power in a structural reform which is not a minor issue at all as the Constitutional Court has pointed out And on the merits five amending articles seven additional articles nine transitional articles one derogation and eight final articles incorporating some of the reforms outlined in component 23 of the recovery plan submitted to the European Commission Well without going into the criticism of the still and vaporous texts that appear in the report which admit an interpretation and the contrary hence the Commission accepts them the truth is that the reform is mainly understood in two areas that of contracting and that of collective bargaining In short recruitment it 's just a nominal make up of contracts that costs the same Point Beyond the provisions we could have sought formulas by which the temporality necessary by the Spanish productive model was not associated with precariousness but for this purpose it should have introduced a flexibility mechanism through for example article 41 of the Workers Statute since in the face of complicated situations of companies they can only opt for dismissal That is to say we are once again increasing the cost of hiring the company the tax on labour and more barriers to entry Collective bargaining The aim of ultraactivity and the strengthening of the sectoral agreement when it was already de facto and did not endanger the rights of workers has only one objective according to the text itself and says Recovering the central role and strengthening the legitimate scope of action of the negotiating subjects of the collective agreements In short raise the power of the subsidized left wing unions the same that run through the streets at the hands of terrorists asking for the freedom of ETA prisoners who have killed hundreds of workers So let it be clear that we are not the People 's Party let alone Citizens We will not only admit any labour reform that would be beneficial to Spanish workers to job creation to businesses to boost our economy but we would even be their supporters but not precisely of this reform because this reform as the Government wants only serves the interests of the class unions and the IBEX 35 abandoning the majority of workers making it difficult to create jobs and obviating SMEs and self employed people as the main drivers of the occupation in Spain And most importantly the main thing is forgotten and yet the text itself gives us the clue in the second paragraph of the exhibition first when it is said It is not the labor norm the only place to face and solve these problems and this is where the big changes have to be made Ladies and gentlemen the Spanish State today is a looting and plundering structure of the middle and working classes which confiscates by the double method of inflation on the one hand and the fiscal pressure on the other which is reducing to misery millions of Spaniards when work is the great heritage of many of those Spaniards What can not be done is that a worker who collects 1400 euros costs the company 2200 euros and that moreover that average Spanish Juan has to pay 21 of all his operations to the largest commissioner who is the State without prejudice to all the direct and indirect taxes plus the shameful cost of the party of autonomy A milleurist is a dosmilleurist harassed by the state And as long as the reform penalizes the private sector the Ministry of Labour as the rule is already in force it is allowed to hire temporary workers in particular a thousand in an agency that directly depends on you Minister as is SEPE You can't lie to everyone all the time We are in a society of deceived young people without jobs and with our forgotten older ones who are forced to operate with financial institutions and hire bank cards and cannot even count on the smile of the cashier when they go to the bank for greater glory of digitizations and international agendas It 's those little things that do n't kill time or absence This government is a farce they do not care about the workers what they care about are the privileges of the trade unions which have not represented the workers for a long time Therefore the lesser evil is not admissible when there is a possible good The State must be strong but small austere effective and agile In short in the face of a reform that reinforces confrontation through class unions we propose to sow solidarity in the face of a reform that hinders employment we propose to sow recruitment facilities in the face of continuous State intervention to sow subsidiarity and private initiative in the spirit of prohibition to sow responsibility in the face of the constant threat of sanction to sow advice and help in the face of unnecessary bureaucracy to sow simplicity of processing in the face of arbitrary imposition to sow legal certainty in the face of State abuse to sow the rule of law in the face of Agenda 2030 to sow Agenda Spain Ladies and gentlemen we know the way to grow without fear live in peace and face tomorrow with optimism The flag is high and it's not a game

#JuanJoséAizcorbeTorra,Mr President ladies and gentlemen Mr Salvador good afternoon Interesting PNL despite the obvious legal limitations The attitude of this Government towards the undoubted lack of resources of all Spaniards is of absolute indifference I do not know what Mr Hortalà the former secretary general of your group would say to this GNP but I can imagine it and so can you but the GNP that we are dealing with is not correct in the diagnosis or in the remedies but simply to see the obvious symptoms Workers are losing purchasing power in the face of government indifference In this sense it would seem reasonable to join the proposed measure with these legal limitations it spoke in theoretical terms because the Spanish above all the most humble and the middle classes deserve especially not only empathy but the obligation to put all the tools at our disposal to achieve what we have always defended in the VOX Parliamentary Group decent wages fair wages and what in justice corresponds However the measure obviouss some issues beyond the legal limitations which you know very well and which would set a very important precedent for intervention Wages as you say have risen by 2.56 and as a result and given the attitude of the indifferent government which has refused to deflate the tables of the IRPF the worker has not lost only the purchasing power that results from subtracting from inflation the rise he has experienced but more In other words the disposable income of workers has risen less than 2.56 because of the non-correction of the bases and the progressive nature of the tax in the face of government indifference Also a rise in wages with the formula that it proposes in addition to with law rank and already knows that that is very difficult would generate second round effects In other words it could lead us to a spiral of price wage price increases that would keep inflation high for a long time and that must be avoided by all means as it could not be assumed by employers in all cases thereby increasing unemployment and closing down the business And the self employed will have 10 more income And will self employed people and SMEs with one two three four or five workers have a 10 higher income in order to be able to take on that 10 increase And thus the proposal as described could generate comparative grievances in the second point which would affect distributive justice because it seeks to regain the purchasing power of all public workers For this reason it would be logical and I propose this to you that the fund that you propose should be nourished by unnecessary ideological and political spending savings that are carried out through an analysis of the efficiency of public spending to see where it is wasted In this we can help you a lot from VOX no doubt Moreover absurd situations could arise as defined in the proposal such as the fact that workers with wages little more than three times the inter professional minimum wage were overpaid by others who paid a little less than three times the inter professional minimum wage If we do not deflate the tax bases of the IRPF the disposable income of the benefitted workers would rise less than inflation anyway If we want to increase the disposable income of workers and in VOX we do want to do so without excessively increasing wage costs in order not to produce unemployment or boost the inflationary spiral we must look for other solutions In this way it would seem reasonable despite the government 's indifference to deflate the tax bases of the IRPF to reduce so called contributions of the worker to reduce the so called contributions of the employer and to incorporate such reductions into the gross payroll of the workers on discharge at the time of entry into force without prejudice to other formulas that our group is going to propose shortly regarding the deductibility of the business share in the corporation tax In short ladies and gentlemen wage increases yes of course yes but not so Elie Wiesel Mr Zaragoza I do n't know where Mr Zaragoza who was very impetuous today said that the opposite of love is not hatred but indifference And that 's what the government has done act indifferently with Spanish workers Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,40.969555,4.234572,2,mr president ladies gentlemen mr salvador good

#MaríaMagdalenaNevadoDelCampo,"Thank you President Good afternoon We welcome the victims with all our affection and respect and we deeply regret that they have had to spend seven years to resolve a mere parliamentary procedure and thus their problem Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Thanks to the tense debate that took place here last week Mrs Nogueras and Mrs Montero learned that the Republican left had agreed on a decent matter And since my VOX Parliamentary Group is not like you who consistently vote not for everything we propose for the mere fact of being VOX we will vote yes to exemption from the payment of the IRPF from orphan children 's scholarships following the Germanwings accident We have lived the pardons to the seditious we have seen how 16 of the budget for autonomous communities is going to stop in Catalonia and suddenly surprise a matter of general interest How many matters left Mr. Rufián Is there any particular relevance that the Spaniards have a right to know This initiative serves as an example for us to demonstrate the diligence with which the governments of the People 's Party and the Socialist Party work and I will tell you why Rajoy promised that these orphans bear no burden for the compensations received then Sánchez promised I guess there was the mistake trusting in who always does just the opposite of what he promises And now Mrs Montero promises it not without first pointing out warmly that the victims are nobody's And it is that the victims of tragedies the victims of traffic accidents and above all the victims of ETA have something in common you do not care at all You care about those victims who make up those oppressed collectives to be able to patrimonialize subsidize and amortize although that gives better to this other minister Montero who is also not present The Minister of Finance is more of On Monday I fix that of the capital gains mayors Do n't worry we 're not going to stop the cash register Why did n't Minister Montero fix this for the weekend Have you not been able to work with the noise that the hundreds of thousands of carriers hunters fishermen farmers farmers and everyone who makes an honest living Have those voices that shouted Government resignation disconcentrated a lot Do n't worry it does n't take much concentration the 800,000 euros that belong to these people who are demanding these orphans and not the Treasury are going to be compensated in excess with the more than 3.5 billion that they are going to enter thanks to the scandalous increase in inflation which they not only do not avoid but also encourage For everyone to understand the Government is delighted that the rise in prices generates an increase in excise and VAT revenues The taxpayer is suffocated by the price of light gas gasoline and commodities And who wins Finance Do you think Mrs Montero is going to adjust the IRPF to inflation to curb the massive impoverishment of the Spanish No that money they want to silence the class unions and continue to subsidize voters Mrs Montero said that the victims are nobody 's and I will answer that all Spaniards are victims of their poor management They are throwing away lords of the PSOE of Podemos and all others they are throwing away all that they have promised them and that they have not fulfilled Those who are now in ruin are telling you loud and clear that they can no longer They have told the Government and they have told Mrs Montero directly that she will return as soon as possible the amounts to these orphans who have never had to pay

#JoséRamírezDelRío,Thank you Madam President These days they have big surprises for us Yesterday came a member of the Unidad Podemos with the sickle and the hammer and today they are claiming Václav Havel and in addition ET It seems to us that living with you must be quite a surprise it must be a real scare Finally it must be very difficult to make budgets with these ideological vavenes persuading them These budgets brought by the Government show that their only interest is the elections that await us Since Pedro Sánchez arrived in Moncloa there are one million more people who have lowered the poverty line The queues of social eaters are getting longer even many of our friends are having to close their shops in our cities Therefore the fact that we meet with this amount of money dedicated to the personal benefit of the President of the Government cannot fail to cause us a great rejection With this way of using public money I now truly understand that the condemnation of the corrupt in Andalusia has seemed so bad to them A budget for the Ministry of Culture and Sport of 1804 million euros 1804 million should be a great joy for all of us This is a large amount of money that could correct a large number of problems in the cultural sectors of our country However the fact of rewarding your allies has meant that instead of serving the public interest we are in debt to keep you in government which seems to us to be a double punishment for Spain Since we have the European funds we have warned of the difficulties of managing them It is very difficult to prevent a part of the European funds being returned it has historically happened in Spain That is why it was essential to have the right staff to manage them and that has not been done We have been saying this for three years we told your predecessor three years ago we told you and the people who came to the Commission last year and yet nothing has been done about it The funds for staff have been increased but for other staff not for whom it is precisely necessary to help them manage European funds After the collapse of the PSOE 's electoral expectations among the young population they launched the cultural bonus program We indicated to them that the design of this cultural bonus was absurd because Gabi the player from Barcelona 18 years old would be able to have access to that bonus and yet a 16 year old or 20 year old from Las Tres Mil Híviendas or Las Palmeras in Córdoba would not have access which made people who did not need that bonus at all benefit while others who did need it urgently could not have access to it You told us that you would improve the design of the bonus in successive calls However nothing has changed at all from the design of the bonus Moreover they have rebudgeted the same amount of the previous year 210 million euros although they already know at this point that they are going to spend a little more than half of the budget last year in which they budgeted the same so it seems to us that they could make much better use of the money In the sports sector we have a budget of 315 million euros which in its ordinary budget is 208 million 7 million more than last year That 7 million euros more is going to go straight to women 's sport which is fine They put 5 million euros to launch the Women 's Professional Football League However we have the problem that we have an inflation of 9 in 2022 which means that in real terms investment in sport in Spain is going to decrease a very large amount of money Because the whole increase is given to funds that are for very specific programmes special programmes that are to be seen to be carried out That is why we believe that these budgets pose great dangers to the future of our sports and cultural sectors And do n't tell us you 're running it because even your Republican Left partners in Catalonia are telling you that not all these programs are running properly These budgets had no arrangement from the beginning it was impossible to amend them however those who have tried and tabled amendments have learned in their own right that they only served for the fun of this group of sectarians who have drawn up this budget However I believe that the Spanish deserve to know what this money should be devoted to This money should be dedicated to recovering the more than 1100 monuments on the list of Hispania Nostra that are threatened Monuments whose collapse makes us a third world country This money should have been dedicated to financing research in archaeological sites which have barely been excavated and which we have many archaeological fields throughout Spain That money should have been devoted to promoting the development of audiovisual sectors without sectarianism and without electoralism They should have made things easier for cultural entrepreneurs Theater entrepreneurs are paying VAT that is not paid by national theatres and it seems to us that this is unfair competition and that should not be allowed Entrepreneurs in the world of sports gyms are having great problems because all the tax rebate requests we have made have been rejected We should really invest in high performance centres and not just half a million euros in these budgets They should have improved our presence in Hispanic speaking countries in Europe and in the United States because it is essential that our cultural markets be expanded in order to achieve a size that allows them to be profitable And there are many other things to which this money should have been devoted money that we hope the Spaniards can see in the future general budgets of the state when they can forget this ghost government and these budgets of ruin Thank you very much Madam

#EduardoLuisRuizNavarro,Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen Members of the Assembly of the Community of Madrid welcome A preview as you like to say to a famous Member of Parliament here Mr Baldoví do not try any harder we already know that you dance very well in fact you dance other well but we will not hire you for the 22nd that we already have high level figures not like you We are discussing today the consideration of a proposal for a law that deals with the amendment of three state laws the General of Grants the Law on Public Sector Contracts and the Organic Law Regulating the Right of Association and it does so for the purpose of combating anti-Semitism although it is clarified in the initiative that in this case it is specifically sought to protect those who profess the Jewish religion and not other ethnic groups or beliefs that could also be included in the concept of Semitism which is somewhat broader In the preamble in particular the aim is to bring about a change in legislation so that public aid contracts or subsidies may not be available to entities which carry out discriminatory practices on grounds of birth race sex religion belief and in particular stress on anti-Semitic grounds in order to determine clearly the loss of opportunities when such a situation occurs It is clear that our parliamentary group as the autonomous deputy Pablo Gutiérrez de Cabiedes has already put forward here will support the consideration of this initiative because it is of justice The serious attacks that have been suffered in Spain by those who profess the Jewish religion as well as the Christians by phylotterrorist groups linked to leftism are chased by supporters who have representation in public institutions without going any further in this very House through extreme leftism of socialists and ultra leftism of communists That is why measures must be taken to curb them We have heard you say here many excuses for not deciding clearly to support this initiative but ladies and gentlemen works are love and not good reasons It is works that you leave in a number of municipalities of Spain through the famous network of municipalities ELAI free spaces of Israeli apartheid all of which are governed by parties of front populist court and under whose umbrellas there have been and there are actions as disgusting as conjures to not engage with any companies products entities or organizations of Israeli origin or with Jewish links because of the simple fact of being so or to apply to everything that smells of Jewish the so called politics or culture of cancellation that is canceling contracts with theatre companies lecturers filmmakers actors or Israeli companies that are in progress being the most serious example that happened in Cadiz in September 2018 when the communist mayor of that city known as the Kichi took precedence of his office as mayor to promote this racist act and the ruthless attack that using the power of the City of Molins de Rei in Barcelona his mayor perpetuated in November 2018 against a group of women youths in opposition to the Spanish party that some officials in this dispute prevent these parties The party had to play elsewhere and behind closed doors as if the girls were stinking Faced with this it should also be remembered that my parliamentary group defended last week in the Constitutional Commission a PNL calling for greater protection for the right of religious freedom of Spain a PNL that defended our colleague and deputy José María Sánchez and that was rejected in this House by the leftist groups The result serves as a demonstration and confirmation of the continued belligerence of leftism in the twenty first century towards a fundamental freedom for the support of any democratic system such as religious freedom Works are love and not good reasons I told them More works According to the report prepared by the Observatory for Religious Freedom and Consciousness during 2020 attacks on the right to religious freedom in Spain increased by 37 over the previous year especially against the Catholic religion According to the observatory the breakdown by type of attacks would be as follows two cases of direct physical aggression against Catholic believers for being so thirty attacks on Catholic places of worship twelve harassments against Catholic believers for being so fifty seven scorns against Catholic beliefs and believers 121 cases of belligerent secularism with marginalization from the religion of the public sphere Ladies and gentlemen listen carefully two out of three acts of violence against hatred Fidei in Spain suffered by a Catholic in 2020 Not only are the Jews attacked in Spain in Europe and in the world but also Christians and we Christians are the ones who suffer the most martyrdom all over the world Therefore ladies and gentlemen when this initiative is taken into consideration we will work to ensure that the right to religious freedom is guaranteed also for Christians and we will improve this initiative with amendments In short ladies and gentlemen rather than collectivizing society as leftism does by fabricating false offenses to which to water with public money it is necessary to protect those who are real victims of attacks that they pay with their lives On this path you will always find VOX and very soon you will see how it is also decided in Spain Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,36.66664,8.200726,2,thank much madam president ladies gentlemen members assembly community madrid

#EduardoLuisRuizNavarro,Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen It is really difficult to talk about budgets when we have an unscrupulous government that betraying its nation changes accounts for penalties and deceives us with tales to release prisoners and the tales start every autumn with the new general budgets of the state Both the AIReF and the Banco de España the European Commission and the IEE among other bodies have questioned the data on which the budgets are based because they are not credible Title III staff costs is a subject on which the Government has not stopped fooling all Spaniards since it drew up the first budgets of this legislature in 2020 We have already said this last year and also the previous year and the previous year it is indecent to place on the Spaniards the burden of putting up with an elephantic government that to top it off spends public money on insulting us all by calling us wasteful Did you waste Crazy for turning on the light or putting on the heating Did you waste Crazy for trying to live with the dignity that we have earned by right and that this government should protect because that 's what we pay you for How dare you thus lose respect for the Spanish people How dare you What do we call a government that has not wanted to reduce a single ministry a single high office or a single euro of political spending to share even a little the pressures in which its people live How What do we call a government that has n't stopped hiring advisors even at the worst time in the pandemic when the worst people were going through it How From January to September of this year this government has broken the national record of spending on advisors 51.5 million according to data from the General State Intervention This represents an increase of almost 6 over the previous year Is this your way of showing empathy Yes the Spaniards have seen what that is called progressiveism It 's a school of peseprismo and mammourria What if they start by shutting down the Ministry of Equality In the current year its staffing has been increased by 121 121 But in view of 2023 they are planning to put 65 more officials in that pool of incompetence and hatred And for what To keep calling us criminals all men To lower the penalties to rapists or pederasts or to protect women kidnap children Because that is what this ministry is dedicated to under the orders of the Government because they are not avoiding the deaths of women at the hands of men or men at the hands of women nor by the way those of children at the hands of their parents men and women yes also women even if it bothers them to hear it that is the truth Is that the authority of this ministry that we have heard before Mr. Honrubia No the government will not close it but we will as soon as we can because in a VOX government there will be no room for hatred of the Spanish be they men or women Another well known unskilled public manger is the Ministry of Universities How many Spaniards would know the minister 's name Not even a survey of Tezanos would fix it ladies and gentlemen In these circumstances they promise to increase the staffing by 31 more by 2023 when by 2022 it had already increased by 65 over the previous year This is see gon zo so And we come to the ministry of the Presidency the courtship of Mr. Bolaños who attends this gentleman named Pedro Sánchez A staff of 1721 is planned for the coming year of which 37 will be senior officials and 553 advisers And in VOX we ask ourselves How much does Pedro Sánchez need to live among flattery ladies and gentlemen Because a politician who needs a contribution of 553 advisors is either deeply incompetent or is implementing a giant manger which will be very resilient and very circular but nothing sustainable This is a policy of leverage ladies and gentlemen of leverage And in the face of this waste the Directorate General of the Police will see the police force reduced in 2023 by 4138 implying a loss of more than 5 of its staff Ladies and gentlemen without security there is no freedom even the socialists are already beginning to recognize that octopus is a problem that worries the Spaniards and they are not mere bubbles of what you call far right Looks like they want to get out of the matrix they live in Well socialist ladies and gentlemen welcome to reality But it is that the Ministry of Justice also rigs the other pillar that supports the security building the Administration of Justice allowing insults to the judiciary breaching the commitments made with judges and prosecutors lawyers and other officials No bargaining tables for wages no pay adjustments no reduction of population groups no updating of the amount of guards outstanding for years Nothing for 2023 We need more cops more judges and less plugs ladies and gentlemen These budgets of ruin have no possible amendment because with this government the distance must be infinite Fortunately every day there is less for our country to regain democratic normality freedom order and security Members of the Government you will have to listen to us We will demand from here and also from the streets of Spain that they stop hurting our people We will teach them that democracy is respected and defended Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,40.825718,7.624192,2,thank much ladies gentlemen really

#EduardoLuisRuizNavarro,Good morning ladies and gentlemen minister The truth is that when I met this bill that talks about fighting corruption I was amazed I could not believe that precisely the PSOE the party most closely linked to corruption plots in Europe could promote such an initiative I understand that the Socialists had finally decided to take responsibility for the terrible plot of corruption in Andalusia or for the recent Qatargate or Morocco Gate a corrupt plot that particularly affects your European parliamentary group but with you there is no hope Now if as they say this rule will serve to protect whistleblowers from corruption perhaps ladies and gentlemen of the PSOE you still have a chance to do something for your country Let 's see Can any of you help us recover almost 700 million that Andalusian socialism has stolen from all Spaniards Can any of you tell us if there is any high socialist office that has been favoring Morocco 's interests in exchange for money Is there a brave man sitting in those seats that 's cheering up Does n't look like it does it Anyway I must admit that as we said in the Commission it has been hard for us to discover that under the pretty wrap candy was poisoned because under those headlines who talk about protecting whistleblowers from corruption and fighting it this project really hides a content that is highly toxic to democracy and coexistence This bill says it transposes a European directive but the truth is that it ends up perverting it and it does so because it extends its object to any criminal offence and to any serious administrative offence and is not limited only to the list contained in the directive Observe observe insist how its name begins Draft law regulating the protection of persons reporting administrative offences Let them report administrative violations see This was the important thing was n't it ladies and gentlemen Wow This bill simply makes it possible to open up general causes against defects And of course to protect whistleblowers even anonymous ones within the framework of the liberticidal laws created by this government such as sectarians called for democratic memory equality abortion or the next few for animal or trans protection among others we are dangerously approaching Spain from its Popular Front or Marxist Cuba with the famous political whistleblowers right Mr Santiago You know them well Can you imagine what can happen for example to a teacher who is heard by the political commissioner explaining to his students that human beings are biologically men or women Can you imagine what can happen for example to a foundation that is observed by an infiltrator giving a talk about PSOE 's criminal history during the 1930s Of course they imagine it of course that 's why they have expanded the object in this twisted way It is clear that the serious legal uncertainty that this bill introduces puts at risk freedom of opinion and expression something that no Democrat should tolerate Therefore while agreeing with the need to protect those who report serious crimes and offences related to corruption corruption the health of our democracy is incompatible with supporting this bill Proof of VOX 's commitment to the fight against corruption is the registration in February 2020 of an initiative for the comprehensive protection of whistleblowers of corruption but unlike this our initiative delimits its scope exclusively to those infractions produced in the field of the public sector and from which it could result an injury to the public sector We do n't open the door to general causes Reporters of corruption must be whistleblowers of corruption and not squatters or political commissioners used to harass and accuse dissidents On the other hand there are some other details of this bill that we do not like either For example we do not like the existence of this consultative commission that creates the rule because it introduces more bureaucracy and therefore more political spending Nor do we like the system you are proposing to appoint the independent authority because we believe that its independence is not adequately guaranteed That is why in one of our amendments we propose and propose that it be appointed by Congress and not by the Government which is what you have brought here We understand that the appointment by Congress makes it possible to broaden the scope of protection and thus to give greater security to its independence Another element that we also do not like is that the bill usurps the role that the Local Regulators Act gives to provincial parliaments especially in this case it is what it is the role of supporting small municipalities because it is an exclusive and exclusive task of provincial parliaments Finally we do not think it is right that companies should be forced to appoint a manager to assume the role of head of the internal communication system More flexibility must be given to companies to choose the person from their staff who is best qualified to perform this function be it management or be employed because the key is here in which the necessary legal preventions are established so that when the person in charge is acting in the performance of his or her duties he or she cannot be disturbed disturbed or sanctioned by his or her superiors In short we are not going to support this fraudulent transposition of a European directive because it has totalitarian tufos Look the best gift you can give all the Spaniards for Christmas is to ask forgiveness for so many years of corruption to put an end to the blow to democracy and to return everything stolen And minister let 's see if for Reyes you fulfill your retributive commitments to judges prosecutors and lawyers of justice Do you know the expression pacta sunt servanda Well let 's do it,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,46.215332,7.319403,2,good morning ladies gentlemen minister truth met bill

#AndrésAlbertoRodríguezAlmeida,Thank you very much Madam President Mrs Fernández you have done some historical analysis of the initiative and indeed I think that could be considered as stretching the gum that is you have copied exactly the same initiative that you have presented in the Senate and it comes from a non-legislative proposal adopted last week in the Parliament of the Canary Islands Although you spoke of two GNPs really the origin of everything is a motion for a resolution which was adopted in the debate on the state of evil so called canarian nationality By the way ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party and the PSOE I do n't know how canaries can be fooled with that of canarian nationality It is a name that has been used in the Parliament of the Canary Islands which you have given for good and I would like to know if any of you when you fill out a form where you put nationality write Canary Islands There is no canarian nationality In addition it seems that we will have to get to that autonomous police that the canaries we call guanchancha because it lacks absolute meaning it founded the Canary Coalition for greater glory of its president in order to be able to move with the helicopter and for a few more things in order to end up telling them that the Canary nationality does not exist as it has happened elsewhere in this country As far as the content of the initiative is concerned we have tabled two amendments and of course it has thanked all the amendments but it has not been agreed with us The first is for technical reasons because points 1 and 4 are absolutely redundant because they say exactly the same thing with different words so I understand that one of them should be deleted In paragraph 3 they insist on the creation of a joint committee of the Government of the Canary Islands and the Government of Spain to monitor and evaluate the subsidies provided for the transport aid of the Canary Islands But ladies and gentlemen of the Canary Islands the aid we can have in our capacity as the outermost region of the European Union is not specific to the Canary Islands but is specific and negotiated by the Kingdom of Spain because you will know I suppose that the subjects of original law in the field of international relations are the States and not the regions Therefore the only one with the competence to monitor and evaluate such aid is the State the Kingdom of Spain On the other hand I think that the aid provided for in this framework of the outermost region of the European Union is very good but it needs to be updated Indeed it is accelerating by the pandemic and the rather high inflation that we are suffering but we need to update them We must do so I think it is very good that you demand it but perhaps after you have been in the Canary Islands for almost three decades what we need to do more is to create a framework where economic activity can be developed and not just for a few because for example you did not want to talk about the AIEM which is something we have in the Canary Islands something that you have promoted and protected for your business friends very little It is quite contrary to the tax of the rich of which they so much like to talk to those on the left It is a tax that all canaries pay to help very few friends of the Canary Coalition Finally they are blaming this Government for its lack of work which it has said was not going to leave anyone behind Be clear because this government is here for your support It is true that his partner did not want to support him in the investiture and cost him a sanction but be clear What is the position of Coalition Canaria I understand that if it was sanctioned it is because they want to support this Government And they also supported him when the motion of censure came forward not proving it and they have supported him on many other occasions Be clear because Spain wants to decide and has to have clear ideas Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,40.04515,1.6157134,2,thank much madam president mrs fernández done historical analysis initiative indeed think could considered stretching gum copied exactly

#AndrésAlbertoRodríguezAlmeida,Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen in this Title VII which we are debating now only two amendments have been tabled to Rule 93 and 113 which have been rejected by the Government and I will therefore make no reference to them The presentation of the draft law of the general budgets of the State the so called yellow book in relation to this Title VII gives a very eloquent data regarding the situation to which we have arrived I am sure that quotes As a result of this process of decentralization in Spain today more than 43 of public expenditure is managed by autonomous communities and local corporations while the central administration without including the funds of Social Security manages approximately 23 of total expenditure closure quotes Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party and the PSOE for the joy of the nationalists enemies of Spain have surrendered the once solid Spanish state and diluted it in a realm of taifas with very serious consequences This level of decentralization of the State was not even remotely in the mind of the 1978 Constituent Legislator who illuminated the possibility of setting up autonomous communities for a few territories with the naive belief that the few nationalist at the time conformed to a certain level of self government This naive and therefore guilty confidence of the constituent was soon betrayed by the continued and dissatisfiedness of those nationalists who continue to show today that they will always want something more The last example we had a few days ago as soon as President Sánchez made public that he made the rule of law before Catalan coupsmen by eliminating the criminal type of sedition Mr Rufián declared that that was not enough and set the new target on the type of embezzlement In this context the most disloyal to Spain have always benefited Why do PP and PSOE presidents strive to surrender to those who attack Spain from within It is a shame that we are left alone in this battle In the Canary Islands they are already responsible for the People 's Party announcing their post-election pacts with the Canary Coalition Are you not aware ladies and gentlemen of the serious damage that Spain is causing to achieve or maintain quotas of power in public institutions How far are they willing to betray Spain How long Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party and the PSOE you have shown that since the nationalists do not limit their demands you do not limit your betrayal of Spain for its spurious and miserable party interests For the PSOE this betrayal has a particularly striking hue those who claim to promote equality have contributed to the development of the largest generator of inequalities in the national territory the autonomous communities which have dedicated themselves to multiplying inequalities and discrimination due to the territory of residence in many areas such as taxation education and public health We are now seeing this in the area of complaints about the management of public health in some autonomous communities The differences between communities should be ashamed to rule by preaching equality among the Spaniards His betrayals have exceeded any moral limit I cannot forget the speech in this very rostrum of my colleague Antonio Salvá the father of Diego Salvá the civilian guard killed by ETA in which he manifested the pain that caused him to see the political representatives of the terrorist band ETA no longer only on the street but in institutions like this House charging a public salary People 's Party and PSOE agreed on a Political Parties Act to exclude from the institutions the promoters of violence against the Spaniards and their institutions and the same parties PP and PSOE agreed on a Constitutional Court that betrayed the Spaniards undermining the work of the security forces and bodies of the State and the judiciary They opened the door of institutions to the miserable and cowardly murderers of so many innocent Spaniards including without deceiving themselves the betrayal of their own victims and their families How far are they willing to go When will the minutes of the negotiation with ETA that we have requested be made public The Spaniards have the right to know the price you put on our dignity All this is not postulated by left or right but by common sense They have left us to those of VOX but more and more Spaniards are opting for this political instrument at the service of Spain which does not promote a Spain divided into sides but defends the union of all Spaniards on basic and essential issues in our life such as food security health the defense of private property religious freedom freedom of thought freedom of choice in relation to the education of children and a long series of fundamental rights and freedoms that have been taken away from the Spaniards and silenced in the political debate VOX has come to reopen these debates which the consensus of the People 's Party and the PSOE considered closed in order to recover these fundamental rights and freedoms in favour of all Spaniards regardless of their political convictions It is clear from the foregoing that the State of self government in no way assists in the efficient management of the services to be provided by public administrations The state of autonomy has been the mine in which the political class has found the line to develop a mastodontic welfare state for its comrades friends and family replicating state structures and institutions that no Spanish would miss if closed tomorrow It has also been the battlefield in which PP and PSOE have surrendered to Spain in favor of the nationalists who want to break it and it has been the rake in which equality and peace among the Spaniards has been given In VOX we will give that battle until the last consequences on the political the judicial and the social There is no other solution we must dismantle the autonomous state and give back to the Spaniards their unity their dignity and their money Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,39.9817,7.8237414,2,thank much madam president ladies

#AndrésAlbertoRodríguezAlmeida,Thank you very much Mr President Ladies and gentlemen Mrs Oramas today we are debating your non-law proposal registered on 24 February concerning the volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma which began on 19 September 2021 and which was declared to be completed on 25 December almost four months ago Mrs Oramas it 's better late than never but time in these kinds of natural disasters is key From the VOX Parliamentary Group we recorded a non-law proposal on September 21 2021 that is two days after the volcanic eruption began As for the timing of your initiative Mrs Oramas but as far as the substance is concerned it is on a single page of the Official Gazette of the Courts General and I would like to read briefly The Congress of Deputies urges the Government of Spain to launch a programme of economic recovery in La Palma which includes in depth aid lost to cover the current and future needs of companies until the economic recovery is complete preferential loans to cover infrastructure costs necessary to recover the activity or to convert the companies in cases where it is impossible to continue the activity as proposed and finally to include palm companies as preferential in all the business or economic support activities that are being launched by the Government of Spain Our initiative registered only two days later is eight times more extensive and urges the Government to fulfil its obligation which is to put all means at its disposal to help the affected immediately and to take as many actions as necessary to offer certainty and hope to the future of the palm trees We are talking about the necessary declaration of the area affected by a civil protection emergency the urgent adoption of a package of exceptional measures the urgent processing of administrative files relating to the measures agreed as a result of the declaration of the area seriously affected the immediate setting up of the coordinating committee which unfortunately was not set up until a month later the assessment of the damage with all the necessary information and the request for aid from the European Union Solidarity Fund On this last point as in many others the opacity of this Government motivated the question of Mr Buxade Villalba MEP for VOX on 3 February to know whether the Government of Spain had sent to the European Commission the damage assessment required for the activation of the aid and its amount if so and whether the Government of Spain had requested an advance in order to be able to provide aid to those affected as soon as possible I insist that in catastrophic situations like the one we occupy time is key Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Group time is key and palm trees need action Mrs Oramas we have recorded an amendment with three aspects firstly it is a question of establishing the immediate nature of the measure in question secondly our amendment covers the various forms of business activity which your initiative involves in the end companies seeking to avoid unfair exclusions in the processing of aid and finally we eliminate the discrimination that the classification of palmera might entail to businesses self employed and entrepreneurs who are domiciled outside the island of La Palma and who have also been affected and deserve such aid I trust Mrs Oramas that you will accept our amendments Finally Mrs Oramas I am obliged to show you my doubts and concerns about the position of your party the Canary Coalition with regard to the management of the disaster You Mrs Oramas with very good judgment did not support the investiture of a social communist government which presupposed the arrival of communists to the Government of Spain also the consummation of electoral fraud by the betrayal and lies of candidate Sánchez about the partners of government Although you acted with good judgment not supporting the investiture the truth is that your party had given you another indication and that is why you received disciplinary consequences With this background Mrs Oramas although I congratulate you on your common sense I find myself under an obligation to demonstrate that the Canary Coalition is an ideologically drifting party For the Spaniards and I conclude Mr President who are willing to work in freedom both in Madrid and in the Canary Islands only VOX is left Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,38.884266,2.2309065,2,thank much mr president ladies gentlemen mrs oramas today debating non-law proposal registered 24 february concerning volcanic
