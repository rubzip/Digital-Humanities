With all due respect Madam President Very good afternoon ladies and gentlemen To the motion presented today Citizens by his lordship Don Guillermo Díaz passes as to the urgent inquiry he presented it is a little decorated The interpellation was a feignment a kind of penguinella duo in the same way that this motion becomes foam based on conditionals that you have hidden Mr. Díaz Madam President ladies and gentlemen it is the foam of the rivers to ask to eliminate the obligatory masks inside conditioning to the epidemiological situation and the comparative perspective That is what the Government already does which does everything with a gender perspective sustainable resilient incomprehensible and above all cursi It is a futility it is utopian and it is childish to ask the interterritorial council to make a calendar of descalation Our amendment is simple It urges the Government to withdraw the compulsory use of masks in all areas and at any age please release our children except within health and social health facilities and this only until it is essential I 'm pointing out some things we 've learned from the coronavirus The first which is unpredictable so the second point of the petitum is unacceptable by coercion and absurd by irresistible It is impossible to advance a calendar of descalation exposures when we do not know how long the epidemic is going to last whether it is going to turn into an endemic or if omicron is going to be the penultimate or the penultimate variant The second is about masks and he cited the one that is possibly the best university center of epidemiology in the United States the Minnesota CIDRAP First it says that the fabric masks have almost no utility with the omicron variant and second that there is no solid evidence of the utility of the mask against any variant in any environment except for the FFP2 and FFP3 masks in health and social health environments Do not misrepresent the recommendations of ECDC or WHO they are recommendations not obligations In the last update of the ECDC of 7 February at no time do they advocate that they be mandatory moreover as an alternative they put them only for vulnerable people and for vulnerable centers See if it is useless to force to wear the mask that has recently been published this COVID notebook made by twenty five Spanish scientists all very politically correct that is on this side and of twenty five chapters none is intended for masks none Ladies and gentlemen at the moment public health recommendation messages should emphasize the extent to which they have a higher hierarchy of effectiveness vaccination otherwise not All restrictive measures imposed by the Government since the proclamation of the declared state of alarm contrary to the Constitution through VOX must therefore be dropped I 'm on my way We therefore reject the impositions that are imposed on the population when our fellow citizens need recommendations that adapt to the changing reality of the epidemic We refuse to have the children gagged We are disgusted by what a socialist MEP has revealed today in the Committee on Health that one reason for maintaining the mandatory masks is because they have eliminated isolation for the infected What a shame What a shame We are disgusted that the obligatory masks force the Spaniards to choose between masks and heating It disgusts us and we say that 's enough What we need in Spain at the present time is continuous true and verifiable information about the epidemic to provide citizens with sufficient knowledge to take informed measures to protect their health that of their own people and their economy I am sorry to repeat what I said in the Health Committee a few hours ago I 'm sorry because you can give the impression that we believe that on the sides of the sinister and separatists do not understand either our sources Mrs Andres or our arguments I 'm so sorry Nothing closer to reality they do n't understand them I 'm done Thank you very much
Thank you very much With venial Mr. President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Ladies and gentlemen spring is already intuited spring is intuited as you were two years ago How happy you promised them after you had agreed the government of the monster with the Catalan separatists with those of the axe and the snake with those of the nuts How they enjoyed those who were going to storm the heavens and stayed in the capon When the Wuhan virus killed thousands of Chinese nothing happened because they were Chinese like banning a manifestation by the coronavirus when it was something that came from the East Coronavirus hey their spokesmen sang a flu the doctors of the regime said they die with coronavirus not by coronavirus they said They denied the reality of the virus just to do their little party on March 8th Two years ago but it looks like ten Minister Since then no one will be able to shout live on March 8th without their mouth being filled with flavor to crematorium ash That date is stained forever no one will be able to celebrate it without remembering all the dead that caused that manifestation For us these deaths have names and surnames they are not numbers and there will be no amnesia and there will be justice That viral bomb was possible because the protesters were lied to and the virus spread throughout Spain You Minister were there and suffered its consequences So there are only two options one of them is that he was lied to and the other I can't think of mentioning it To celebrate his feast he lied to the Council of Ministers because now we do know that they had much more information than they gave us Not only did they lie to VOX but they lied to all the Spaniards In that lie they were assisted by the brigade of left wing doctors who now continue to make predictions making them the ball His talking puppet that of 'some cases at most despised the death of the elderly lied about the masks lied about the tests everything to justify an unforeseeability and imperience of the government He counted the thousands of dead with a lunatic smile before Mr. Illa 's funeral gaze Woe to him who took the opposite Because there was a gentleman dressed uniformly and with brushed hair telling us that they were going to watch over the non-addicts to the regime They infected us with lies locked us up illegally with lies and so they made us sick and ruined us with tricks They have varied all epidemiological measurements they have broken the series they have made coherent follow up impossible ladies and gentlemen With lies they declared that they had defeated the virus and the Spaniards continued to die With lies they said that 70 of Spaniards were going to be vaccinated before July 2021 and the Spaniards continued to die Our parliamentary group warned them about vaccines about variants about natural immunity about group immunity We proposed that you buy more vaccines at any price you rejected the motion And the delta variant came and Spanish people continued to die You and the nefarious and nefarious autonomy have confabulated to hide the data two years of epidemic and we do not have a common database and to give inconsistent messages time from induction to depression to more irrelevant and incoherent optimism from black to pink According to their partisan interests instead of funded masks and cheap self diagnosis tests all Taifas Reyezuels have chosen to lock us up and prohibit our mobility The COVID passport has been a gross blackmail to induce vaccination a futile and possibly harmful blackmail Our group ladies and gentlemen has been committed to science and there are our interventions Yes Mr Meijón there are our initiatives to contradict your infuses and those of your accomplices Always for the truthfulness of the data always for the tests and then for the vaccines which we consider the main weapon against the virus and always always ladies and gentlemen for freedom Unlike other groups we believe in the responsibility of the Spaniards Against the confinements we bet that the Spaniards move freely throughout Spain without any other requirement than the DNI We have opposed any measures of vaccination obligation against COVID and have denounced the COVID passport as I said as blackmailer and useless That 's where we were when the omicron variant came in infecting everywhere like a fire in a pine tree Good thing science and industry have invented and manufactured the vaccine you as far as I know have n't invented or manufactured anything just bought it Ladies and gentlemen there is a huge difference between forcing and recommending The recommendation requires an explanation for which it recommends and requires understanding effort for which it receives the recommendation It is the difference between ordering a brute and educating a human being Only opportunism and propaganda have gone to the Government as shown in the subject of outdoor masks I sang one day on the subject of pensions and days later as were the elections of Castile and León in progress so come on we suppressed them All right The outdoor masks have been maintained Minister because they are simply an avatar of collective confinement As the Constitutional Court has said that you have illegally confined the Spaniards for come on let 's put on masks Pedagogy The process of searching for scientific truth is based ladies and gentlemen on the experience of the experiment which in turn is based on the pulsity of methods on the strength given by the great numbers and on the continuous monitoring of the effects in time but above all on intellectual honesty and deliberation among those who know We must explain to the people not to the people but to the people it seems they do not like the people that in the face of any major problem in science there are questions for which we have answers there are questions for which we do not know their answer and there are questions that we have not imagined to ask them and that one day I suppose we will do them That 's the worst In short ignorance must be recognized in science and politics because this process of truth seeking must also permeate political action The bad policy is that of the ignorant who presumes that he knows to justify what he wants to do anyway is the dictatorship of the incompetent and that ladies and gentlemen has to change and is going to change This sixth wave is running out We all want it to be the last and some are even convinced it will be What have we learned That we have to adapt our measures to reality that the totalitarians of all parties prefer to confine themselves to investing in protection and medicines that it is likely that that virus seeder that is the Chinese markets will continue to inject itself and that it is not impossible for the virus to surprise us again That is why we are questioning the Government and asking how it is going to detect the evolution of the virus in one direction or another We need to know a lot ladies and gentlemen We need to know all the characteristics at least the most important especially of the hospitalized of those of the ICU and above all of the deceased We need to know their social and economic conditions not that postal code course the diseases they suffer the medicines they take if they had been infected before the vaccines they have received the time that has passed between the last dose and admission to the hospital and we need to know very important the immune state of the Spaniards We need to know all this ladies and gentlemen because we need not only to know better about the virus but also to know who we must protect as a matter of priority who we must vaccinate again and who are the candidates for the different medicines It 's over This epidemic and the treacherous arbitrary and irrational management of governments have not only caused suffering and death but have inflicted enormous damage on the already scarce confidence of the people in politicians The prestige of our sanity has been brought into shambles it 's almost sinking But there is one thing there is no sensible person in this country who does not recognize that we would be much worse if it were not for science science has saved us Ladies and gentlemen I 'm finishing up We do n't know what the future is preparing for us Anyone who says he knows or is a madman or a liar and politicians and scientists involved in politicians must stop being pythonous from three to four I was beginning by saying that today is the beginning of spring ladies and gentlemen because it is science that has brought it with vaccines and new medicines No doubt there are strong reasons for hope and we are closer to regaining the life we had before the epidemic Ladies and gentlemen this moment that we are living now can be forever or it can be a mere transitional period even if it lasts for years In any case we have to put an end to the policies of the fatty brush the time has come for the health policy of precision We need to know exactly who we need to protect and who we do n't we need to know exactly when we need to act and when we do n't For that we need Minister continuous and true information Out of respect for the dead and the pain of their families out of respect for the sick and because we must be prepared for future epidemics that will come we ask the Government on that journey Mrs Darias are you going to follow the difficult path of science or are you going to take as you have done so far that of totalitarianism and arbitrariness Thank you very much
With all due respect Madam President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon Citizens propose the cessation of compulsory masks in public transport and in some health facilities such as pharmacies and optics Six months ago they tabled a similar more fearful motion and VOX tabled an amendment to remove the mandatory masks for all persons of any age in all areas except within health centres I say this because in the exhibition of this proposition it is said that Citizens stayed alone in this abolitionist petition let 's say so and the only explanation that I think of is that they have problems of memory or identity because as it is now the liberals it can be because of that Despite this we will support this non-law proposal but first I want to highlight several facts First of all here we have been suddenly proposed by the Lordship of Podemos a government of experts but I will point out a number of facts The predominant variant BA.5 is the most contagious COVID 19 has changed and now it can be said that mortality is similar to that of influenza The government 's obligation is for all types of masks but it turns out that fabric masks serve nothing that surgery does not serve just the BA5 variant and that the utility of masks at the population level has only been demonstrated for FFP2 masks and in health environments Point There are no publications that have demonstrated the usefulness of masks in public transport I repeat there are no publications Vulnerable people could benefit from the use of FFP2 masks but if the Government wanted to prescribe FFP2 masks to protect them they should only be for vulnerable people who would have to pay the equivalent of half a litre of milk 600 millilitres of juice and three eggs If the masks remain compulsory as Don Simón claims when the Spanish know that the expert who says that the masks have to be compulsory is Don Fernando Simón they will immediately be removed and if the masks have to be financed it would have to be as proposed by VOX financed by the State and not by the Spanish pocket But the government prefers to seize VAT to fill the pockets of the chiringuitos who want to corrupt our children and our grandchildren both with sex and drugs From this rostrum we demand that the public health committee make public the deliberations and the evidence supporting all its decisions and also because it has to apply article 11 of Law 33/2011 the Spaniards have the right to know it We also call on scientific societies to be courageous and honest to make their recommendations public to see their foundations and to communicate them to all Spaniards so that they have real verifiable and real time information Ladies and gentlemen we need selective shields not global impositions The VOX Parliamentary Group has proposed all the measures which have been many and you know it to combat the epidemic from scientific evidence and under the premise of non-compulsoryness In VOX we believe that the Spaniards have the common sense enough to understand all kinds of reasoned recommendations and therefore we reject the obligatory masks because they are useless to the vast majority and because in these moments of hardship people will have to choose between masks heating or food We announce that we will reject any totalitarian and frightening imposition in the conviction that this Government has taken advantage of it exploited it and if we leave it used it for illegitimate and illegal purposes Thank you very much
"Mr. President come on Ladies and gentlemen a personal note My work as a hematologist and Chernobyl headquarters have led me to collaborate with my colleagues in Kiev Let me send from here my words of support to Dr. Dyagil Dr. Lopina and Dr. Dmytrenko Dr. Krasnow Dr. Timoshenko Dr. Bazyka and Dr. Klimenko and so many others who are taking care of their compatriots and fighting for their freedom in the face of Putin 's bloody dictatorship By the way ladies and gentlemen if anyone had come up to this rostrum and said that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has ended total 150 dead a day and from now on we will consider it an incident and we have decided that we will not report you would take your hands to the head right Well the government of Sánchez and Darias wants to make an information blackout and end the epidemic by decree And I 'm afraid the virus may disagree The motion we put forward ladies and gentlemen to launch a national database against the open source epidemic is based on three pillars first the sixth wave is in decline second we are going to enter a truce period and third the truce is likely not to be permanent Therefore we must be prepared Today is March 8 the 2020 date that the Carlos III Institute of Health not me defined as the shooting date of the epidemic the shooting date of Wuhan 's coronavirus because it was Communist China who blamed the virus and West and especially the Spanish government for letting it in That shot has killed thousands of women and their partners and their parents and grandparents And VOX wo n't forget you and we wo n't forgive you ladies and gentlemen This epidemic Mr President has been that of misinformation and I am not referring to that of the ignorant nor to the bots of Xi Jinping or Putin nor I am referring to the most important that of the government and that of its autonomous governments They have all varied case definitions depending on whether or not they had reactive devices altered measurements and broken the continuity of the time series tricks that have prevented consistent follow up and therefore analysis and criticism The sanitary tariff service has prevented us from having a common database two years after the epidemic and the darkness of information has allowed them to give terrifying or optimistic messages depending on their partisan interests They have continued to frighten us in the sixth wave with the same intensity as at the beginning of the epidemic despite the success of vaccines and the lesser lethality of omicron which is currently 0.9 of those infected From our group we make it very clear we demand the truth and we do not want dictators who pretend to know it when they ignore it Ladies and gentlemen decision making in politics must be based on true information and democracy is based only on an educated and informed people Already since June 2020 statisticians and epidemiologists have realized that one could contribute to the fight against the epidemic if one had a database one national two anonymous three open source and four with free access to any citizen and allowing researchers to collaborate with this poor Ministry of Health that we have weakened by health transfers These researchers indirectly exposed us to this motion because it is very likely that Communist China will infect us again Ladies and gentlemen we still ignore many things about COVID 19 we ignore fundamental things We need to know all the individual conditions that influence their severity the efficacy and toxicity of vaccines in post -COVID syndrome We need to know exactly who we need to protect and who we do n't we need to know when we need to act and when we do n't That is why we need the truth and that information will enable citizens to defend themselves against the authoritarianism of the rulers of all parties Look as a doctor I 've almost never imposed anything I 've given recommendations as politicians in this epidemic we must all do the same recommend Our compatriots want to know the truth to make their own decisions finally ladies and gentlemen to be free and we could approach the truth ladies and gentlemen with this tool that we propose It is a feasible tool ladies and gentlemen that Excel that we all use can admit a 1,049 000 rows and almost 17,000 columns Of course it is the health authorities who have to fill that database and that is the secret because an open database not only informs but forces the rulers to give true and verifiable information We need it not only for SARS CoV 2 but for future epidemics to come to come Ladies and gentlemen this moment of truce that has given us the virus and the effectiveness of vaccines is the time to prepare for difficult times It is not the time for blindfolding but for continuous monitoring of what is happening and for all Spaniards to know it in real time What we propose is ambitious but Spain has proven to be a leader in many things in medicine and we can be a leader in this too Therefore ladies and gentlemen we ask you to support this motion and not to be carried away by the flags but simply to think whether or not the proposal is good for the Spanish Press the green button the red one today is more than ever very despicable Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen"
Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party with this proposal you show that your goodness has no limits and you will forgive me but neither will your hypocrisy You intend to raise the flag of the project of an association that intended to fight against loneliness with the aim that by approving this GNP unanimously in Congress we can come to the UN and ensure that the right not to be alone is considered a universal right and that it is proclaimed that all people have the right to be related to be treated with affection to feel accompanied and that this affective relationship between the equals is free bilateral direct respectful and consented We truly share that no one should be alone that no one should feel alone and that indeed we are faced with one of the most serious problems of our time But do you know ladies and gentlemen where you are most likely not to feel alone to be treated with affection to live with one another and to have that which in such a resounding and ideological way you call a relationship between the same affective free bilateral direct respectful and consenting That place is family ladies and gentlemen There is no better place to feel accompanied loved and cared for than a family in the family there is no loneliness it is in the family where one learns to love and to be loved to care and to be cared for The family is the only place where there is unconditional love and yet the family has always been the great forgotten for you That is why I say to you ladies and gentlemen that your goodness and hypocrisy have no limits because you invent new rights to hide the evil you have done by keeping families from the centre of all your policies because you do the opposite of what you say and set qualities and feelings contrary to those that you show when you talk about fighting loneliness forgetting the family You who have endeavoured to destroy the family as the basic nucleus of society who have encouraged one person households and single parent families without thinking about their future who have normalized the affective relationships of using and throwing who call us to end our days alone who have seen birth crumbling leaving our families without a future who promote abortion so that children who grow our families are not born and euthanasia as the best solution for the terminally ill who suffer loneliness you Your Honor have told us here a real story of the loneliness that these people suffer and to which you only offer a solution You who inoculate the hatred of the man making it difficult for couples you tell women who do not need anyone to be happy that it is better to come home alone and drunk that having many children is a delay you who are going to let children without a diagnosed gender disorder mutilate their bodies making them chronically ill for their whole life and their life in the chronicle of an announced loneliness because they can never have biological children you who allow children who are illegal immigrants to separate from their families to come to our country condemning them to the worst of loneliness which is the loneliness of uprooting which cuts off the affective bonds of the place where they were raised away from their own you are the ones who now come to reassure their consciences with empty declarations of intentions who will not serve anything if you remain alone in that In Spain two million elderly people live alone and more and more are found days or even weeks after they have died without anyone missing them in the indifference of an increasingly dehumanized society No one should be forced to leave their country alone No old man should end up dying alone No child or young person should come home every day from school or college and find that there is no one to ask him how he has gone And of course no one should have to give up forming a family We all need to share our time to be heard to feel that we care about someone to know that we will never be alone and we all know we all know that there is no better cure for loneliness than the family So what is the point of proclaiming a right for every need that we are unable to satisfy Why is that effort to seek so far away what we have so close to Ladies and gentlemen we do not need free bilateral direct respectful and consensual emotional relations What we need are families families in which we feel loved and accompanied families in which parents care for their children since they come into the world and in which children care for their parents until they leave surrounded by affection and respect You foster the family you support the family Make sure that families have the resources they need to care for their children their elders their sick and I assure them that we will fight loneliness much better than with the proclamation of new rights that it would not be necessary to proclaim if we put the family where it deserves which is at the heart of all our policies Thank you very much
"Thank you President I can't remember what it feels like to be able to walk move your arms talk eat drink and breathe I just remember and I value that I 'm still alive I can see hear feel and just because of those simple things I 'm happy Thank you Jordi Sabate for your example of life and for representing so many who like you demonstrate every day that you are indispensable to a society that often forgets the things that really matter And it 's just that today thanks to you we 're partying in Congress Today thanks to you we make a small parenthesis between so much suffering and so much bad news to celebrate life Today we have the opportunity to take a step forward so that assisted suicide is not the only thing that those who govern us can offer to the sick of ALS to alleviate their suffering and that of their families Everything is thanks to you Jordi thanks to you and to the signatures that you collected and that have made it possible for us today to discuss this bill to guarantee the right to a life worthy of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis How sorry I am that you can't be here with us today as you wished How many barriers we still have to break down A dignified life How well these two words sound together especially after having passed in this very House a shameful law of euthanasia that despises the dignity of the lives of those suffering from a disease offering them death as the only alternative It is paradoxical that today we are witnessing how the very people who argue their support for this terrible law in the name of individual freedom are now talking about helping people with ALS live instead of helping them die The truth is that we would like to think that it is because at least they have understood that one cannot exercise his freedom to die when the only alternative offered to him is death Today we would like to think today we would like to be delighted with the possibility of dreaming that the decision to present at last this law has not been circumstantial that it is a decision of silence a decision that involves a change of mentality a change that has placed the life and dignity of the people in the center and that therefore they have now understood that resources cannot be spared to those who have the courage to fight against an incurable disease to those who refuse to throw away the towel to those who do not want to give up living to the last breath If this was happening if this really was happening it means that the struggle and the unpayable example of heroes like you Jordi Sabate and like Juan Ramón Amores JuanCarlos Unzué Toni García Francisco Luzón and so many others since anonymity have not been in vain and that today opens a door to hope not only to the sick of ALS but also to all the sick who with other different pathologies but also cruel neurodegenerative diseases and other rare diseases also need extraordinary resources to live dignifiedly and not to pose an unbearable economic burden for their families Because it cannot be that in the face of a deadly disease and a hundred per cent disability there is not enough public support It can not be that the survival time of a patient is determined by his or her economic capacity and that a well attended ALS patient with the necessary resources lives better and has more life expectancy than another who does not have them Ladies and gentlemen the average cost for ALS patients to cope with their illness is between € 40,000 and € 60,000 per year That means that the vast majority of these patients cannot face it and this circumstance is inhuman It is inhuman for someone to have to face such a test with the added anguish of not being able to have the resources to do so The same is true of other diseases of invalidants and mortals in many cases of children These people need caring staff who in advanced stages must be qualified health personnel to attend 24 hours a day These people need to adapt their homes need assistive devices articulated beds wheelchairs communication systems they need treatments and care that are essential to be able to stay alive aspiration medication and artificial feeding by gastric tube respiratory therapy not to mention the bill of light which has become a real headache for those who have to stay connected to a machine 24 hours a day It cannot be ladies and gentlemen that only those who have resources can afford to live better and longer In an advanced society the survival of the sick cannot depend on their purchasing power we can not afford it The State has an obligation to ensure with its resources the survival of those who struggle to live because there is no other cause that justifies it any more and not a single euro should be spent on anything else that is not indispensable until there is only one person who needs help to survive not a single euro while there is only one sick person who is not cared for as it deserves because a dignified death cannot be given to those who have not been given a dignified life And of course we cannot allow a single patient with ALS or any other serious illness to let go because he feels that it is an insurmountable expense for his family or a burden for those who leave everything to care for them We cannot afford to spend months until these diseases are diagnosed delaying recognition of disability dependence and incapacity for work because time in a disease with little life expectancy is the most valuable thing these people and their families have Ladies and gentlemen we must all live as a collective failure that the first victims of euthanasia in Spain have been sick of ELA because we will never know if the circumstances of having had no support from your Government conditioned the decision they took We will never know what he would have decided to have known that neither they nor their families would lack resources to live decently to the end Today it is evident that you were mistaken by precipitating your law of euthanasia that the good way was this just the one we started today that in the face of the reality of the suffering that occurs at the end of a person 's life with an incurable disease the human and the just is to do what we are doing today to help live instead of helping to die because that is what we are claiming from those who have inspired this law that we help them to live And if they do not surrender if they overlap with their tragedy if they are able to transform an evil into such a great good and give meaning to their sickness and suffering we cannot fail them They with their struggle have taught us the way today and we as politicians have an obligation to follow it because there is nothing that can make more sense of what we do Ladies and gentlemen this case deserves this bill to come forward unanimously today and our wish is that it be so and that from now on not only the sick of ALS but all those who need it have the resources to live a dignified life And I do not want to come down from this rostrum without paying a small tribute on behalf of my entire parliamentary group to all those who fight for their lives and their families for their unpayable example for teaching us with their courage how insignificant most of our problems are for making us regain faith in humanity and for showing us that life is a treasure in all circumstances that it is a gift that cannot be left unopened that it is a light that always shines and that we must put it in a place of honor so that everyone can see it Thank you very much"
"Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon Mary is thirty eight years old and two sons Elizabeth three years old and Pelayo seven years old Mary was orphaned when she was eleven years old and lived with her aunt Pepa her mother 's sister until a few years ago she emancipated Last January her aunt Pepa died for COVID leaving Maria as the sole heir to whom she left the modest house of her village where they lived together until Maria moved to Madrid to look for a better future But Maria today works as an employee in a restaurant charges 1000 euros a month and in the management where the tax matters take her they have told her that if she accepts her aunt 's inheritance she will have to pay 47,000 euros as inheritance tax A house that will inherit that cannot sell until it accepts the inheritance nor can it ask for a loan offering such a house in guarantee to face the payment of inheritance tax If you could sell this house which you can't the town 's real estate company has told you that they wo n't pay you more than 120,000 euros for it although Hacienda assures you and tells you that for the purposes of inheritance tax it has a value of 200,000 euros for those coefficients that they invent in the ministries and that have nothing to do with the reality of the real estate market Mary is faced with the disjunctive of renouncing the inheritance of the one who raised her and continuing with her 1000 euros a month raising two children or accepting the inheritance and paying 47,000 euros she does not have If you ask for a loan it has to be a personal loan to pay the tax and be able to keep your aunt Pepa 's house and it has to be a personal loan up to seven years and it will cost you more than 500 euros a month that is half your salary Not to mention that you will have to pay logically the IBI as well as install an alarm so that you wo n't overwhelm it You progress what would you do if you were Mary Going to the board of directors of an electric right Yeah good Paquita Maria 's neighbor has been hit by the lottery this Christmas she was hit by half a tenth of a player a prize of 200 000 euros a prize in cash for which she has to pay 32,000 euros in taxes Paquita therefore pays less for a lottery prize having cash than Mary for inheriting her aunt 's house than in the best case if she could sell it would receive 120 000 euros although Hacienda assures her that it is worth 200 000 Perhaps that modest house would serve as savings so that Mary 's children could have a future study a career get better training improve their lives Because tuition at the university for the Spanish is not free because the travel grants which are 2000 euros a year do not give for a student to live not three or four months if he is away from home And these are the Spaniards lords of the progressive left feminist ?ista ?ista whom you want to fry at taxes in order to avoid the accumulation of wealth and they say so without squandering The rich to whom you allude continually could be the politicians who go to the governing councils of public societies or to the so called oligopolies who without having given nor plate and only for having the card of the political party of the moment charge hundreds of thousands of euros The John Palomo I eat it I eat it The rich like for example the ministers ministers and 'ministers who constitute societies in tax havens planning their assets so as not to pay taxes and that their children or grandchildren inherit the fruit of the effort of the Spaniards who have worked to keep them comfortably in their armchairs and in their official cars Do we have to pay taxes Yes of course you have to pay taxes of course but they always pay the same the most defenceless the middle classes that you condemn to ostracism and disappearance and the working classes that with this tax system that eschews you for breathing you will never be able to save a euro And this is the sad raw reality Do you really believe that the millionaires to whom you plead tax a lot of money on inheritance and donations Either you are ignorant and live in a parallel world or directly lie I 've been a tax advisor for almost thirty years and I know that reality Their speeches are demagogic and claim rights for the most vulnerable while embracing them with new taxes without eliminating the previous ones and without offering opportunities for people to prosper The fiscal persecution in Spain is like this for the salary you earn you pay IRPF if you buy a house tax on transmissions if we spend and consume VAT if you sell the house surplus value and IRPF and if you die successions And although quality education is the best heritage and the social lift by antonomasia you now with this educational system that you have just implemented deficient and generally approved also intend to deprive the most humble Spaniards of a future of hope In Spain we live an unbearable fiscal hell whose collection is not intended for the welfare of the Spaniards but it feeds every day an ideological and globalist agenda that pushes us to economic and intellectual poverty it leads us to despair it attacks private property and aims to decimate the capacity of citizens to react indoctrinate and lie And for that you already have your media subsidized and busy who do not pay taxes for the subsidies they receive and who are directly engaged in distorting and manipulating the information to the government 's dictate In Spain we have the National Federation against Succession Tax a social and apolitical movement which I imagine you if tomorrow these gentlemen go out to protest will insult them as you did with farmers and truckers those ultra right activists right A federation that brings together the main associations and platforms that have been fighting against the injustice of this cruel tribute for years and that have collected against them more than a million signatures of citizens who do not belong to the elites who are neither rich nor powerful on the contrary they are humble workers and people who are expoliated and who in many cases live real dramas We are facing a tax that violates constitutional rights under articles 14 and 33 and does not fulfil the redistributive function of article 31 of the Spanish Constitution From this tribute we must highlight its scant impact on public resources with a collection of around 27 billion euros And listen said a minister Chiqui if a billion are nothing If 1 billion is nothing twice as much as 1 billion is nothing twice as much as nothing is nothing Do n't you By the way it must be that the minister has a lot of work because the latest collection figures she offers from this tax are 2019 I imagine it will be because of the pandemic or the Putin war The VOX Parliamentary Group in May 2020 presented a bill to eliminate this tax an initiative that was vetoed by the government without an option to debate in this House Once again the Government turned its back on its people ignoring their demands but as perseverance is our guide here we are debating today At a time of crisis when European governments reduce taxes the Spanish Government does not choose to increase the tax burden on the average citizen and if it reduces something as it has done with the price of fuels does it at the expense of whom Of the big millionaire oil tankers No it does so at the expense of the gas station 's pocket which with its effort and scarce resources has to be financed Who do you owe you You see the plumber socialists and 'socialists but well let 's see if it governs We can at once and already the situation improves This text of the bill highlights powerful reasons that justify the arrogation of this tribute This is one of the measures we consider in the Agenda Spain page 22 in case any minister wants to consult it and it is point 46 of the 100 measures of VOX This Agenda Spain which VOX defends for all of Spain without filters or discrimination is to place all Spaniards on an equal footing But as we already know the parliamentary groups that cling to the survival of this tribute precisely those of the rotating doors and boards of directors of the oligopolies ignoring the voice of the people will come up here to tell lies will deal as if this tax is present throughout Europe Lie It does not exist in more than half of the countries of the European Union Which is just progressive and redistributes wealth False It is a tribute given to the autonomous communities and although any of them could eliminate it none does all maintain it At best some improves it such as the Community of Madrid which is the second in collection These differences deepen the deep inequality between the Spaniards becoming confiscatory and precisely a scourge for the working classes not taking into account the real economic capacity of the heir They will say that it is taxed on the real value of inherited real estate Lie The value attributed to the assets subject to taxation is determined by the Administration apart from the reality of the real estate market by a method that leads to an overvaluation of the assets and if you do not agree resort to the courts but first pass by cash and I paid because if not he seized his assets It 's funny because if you offer the Treasury a security right to pay a debt because you have a debt I charge you 100 but if you then have to charge you because we inherit the same good I charge you 200 Same administration even good different standards embarrassing In short this is a tax that generates inequality does not comply with the principle of progressiveity does not contribute to the redistribution of wealth discourages the saving of families represents a minimum contribution to public resources gives up inheritance and finally is questioned by the European institutions Moreover it is a very old tax socialist gentlemen its origin dates from the dates prior to 1812 those remote times that you have removed from history books but which now rescue it if it is to collect taxes right All right Are you progressives of mouth and of package and is it that in the middle of the 21st century when this tax faces numerous problems of social legitimacy being the most controversial tax figure of our tax system do you not embarrass the Spaniards while maintaining a government with 22 ministries other 17 kingdoms of taifas with 21.3 billion for policies of more inequality with a political spending shot that keeps at the expense of suffocating the citizen They 're not ashamed because they should n't have it but I 'm telling you there 's little left for them to keep docking the Spaniards because VOX is already stepping on their heels We are the only hope the only alternative for a future of prosperity for all of Spain Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen"
Thank you very much Madam President The amendment to the Railway Sector Act that we are discussing today seeks to transpose a European directive that should have been completed by 2018 at the latest We have been behind four years they talk about competing competences between the State and the autonomous communities on rail transport an interaction that should according to the opinion give better response to safety but note that we could not have a clearer and closer example that demonstrates the disaster of the autonomy or decentralization of competences on railway infrastructures the train that goes into the very hell itself in the Bejis fire because it was precisely a delay in the transmission of alerts between administrations that caused that train to enter the very same flames resulting in half of the injured passengers So let me question that supposed better answer to security as a pretext for assigning competences Returning to the subject of transposition I am going to tell you about your already known to all poor legislative work and it is that the CNMC has already pointed out the inadequate transposition of the directive with the Railway Sector Act itself because the rule laid down a sanctioning regime clearly insufficient On 21 December by Royal Decree Law 23/2018 transposition of directives to incorporate precisely incorrectly transposed aspects of the directive we are dealing with the railway law was re-amended without changing the sanctioning regime Finally the CNMC informed the preliminary draft of the amendment of the Law on the Railway Sector in respect of fees where the sanctioning regime is not changed and the CNMC reiterated once again the inadequate transposition of the directive by failing to comply with the provisions of the European framework Now that amendment is in parliamentary procedure Ladies and gentlemen it is no longer the amount of legislation that you need to transpose a directive but the most expensive government and with more advisors in history has transposed them all inadequately and late But its catastrophic way of legislating does n't end here no there 's still more By amending the Railway Sector Act with the specific purpose of transposing a directive for a specific purpose liberalisation they amend other rules such as the provision of air traffic services or the State General Budgets Act for the year 2021 which have absolutely nothing to do with the purpose of the rule There is a very interesting point that is included in the opinion where it is said that for reasons of general interest investment in railways maintenance conservation improvement of existing infrastructure and construction of new ones will be improved in order to ensure accessibility and territorial connectivity For we are going to talk about this connectivity and territorial accessibility 8 July Renfe tries to silence the criticisms for the absence of AVE to Malaga by just one train more on Thursday and Friday 10 July a Madrid Santander train leaves passengers stranded for four hours in Palencia 18 July passengers from a Ferrol train to Madrid are caught in the middle of the flames in Zamora 22 July Renfe continues to unrecover the pre-pandemic frequencies 25 July chaos in Seville and Alicante for several hours delays in the AVE to Madrid 29 July the engineers reveal that the projects for the train are increasingly worse 29 July trains such as those for Malaga or Barcelona with huge queues for delays in their departures 31 July the same at María Zambrano station the bus station in Madrid in Malaga 31 July Renfe reprogramm its trains until September and notice of delays in Andalusia 8 August the bus station in Madrid the bus station in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in Madrid in

laugh at the extremists 22 August the ridiculous international the German press mocks Sánchez and his train of shame in Extremadura 22 August an Alvia arrives eighty minutes late leaving Renfe without an intervener 23 August a breakdown in the Cordoba Sevilla section at the height of Ecija causes train delays for several days 29 August the train enters the flames of the Bejis fire Not to mention the deterioration of the service due to the lack of staff casualties for long working hours of up to fifteen hours drivers who deconvoke strike under promise that they will hire more and now Alicante loses the direct connection of the AVE with the station of Atocha That ladies and gentlemen in July and August alone these are the daily problems of the citizens who use the train in addition to the Spain which you have abandoned and which today continue to abandon And as an example see your concessional bus map where stops and frequencies are reduced And let us hope that liberalisation will really serve to improve prices for citizens and not for Renfe to raise prices as he has been doing and that the rest will be the same I would not like to end without mentioning an important point which is the revision of prices in contracts which is intended solely and exclusively for supplies of rolling stock and components necessary for their manufacture and maintenance but they forget the service contracts which will automatically be excluded But moreover it is limited to the rail public service when it should be a global indexing for all the contracts of the Administration in this case railways In short in this norm which could have been without a doubt a norm that will affect in a very positive way the Spanish railway sector and in general the Spanish railway network which has many needs such as the conclusion of the Mediterranean Atlantic Cantabrian Mediterranean corridors the interconnection of the ports the intermodality of some of our industrial polygons and also of the ports neither treat nor establish the pillars to go forward Ladies and gentlemen of the Government liberalisation is planned for the whole of Europe not only for foreign companies to come and operate in Spain but for Spanish companies like Renfe to get to work in Europe We still hope that the Minister will answer our questions in order to report on Renfe 's actions to the French authorities with a view to operating in France So ladies and gentlemen get to work for real Thank you very much
President ladies and gentlemen the Republican Parliamentary Group has tabled a full amendment to the draft Sports Law adopted on 17 December 2021 by this Social Communist Government in the Council of Ministers and it does so because it considers that the draft is unconstitutional It is surprising that the ultra independenceist and republican left appeals to our Constitution which they openly deny and which they claimed only four months ago that it was delegitimized that is that the Constitution is good for them and that they use it for what they are interested in and always for their own benefit My group Mr VOX would like to express its opposition to this amendment as a whole because it is simply a return amendment and does not propose alternatives We believe that a new law on sport is necessary a modern renewed and advanced law that replaces the current one of 1990 We believe that the regulatory framework for sport needs to be updated that the sporting legal system needs to be provided with basic tools to meet the challenges of the coming decades and that there is a need for comprehensive and appropriate regulation to meet the needs of the current sport This does not mean that we share the full content of the project with which we are very critical and this is reflected in our partial amendments to its articulation but we believe in the need for a new law a law of consensus a law equal to what Spanish sport deserves that so many glories have given our Spanish nation The Republican Parliamentary Group does not offer alternatives simply because it has no interest in Spanish sport It is based on its amendment that autonomous competence in sport is invaded They even dare to include in their consideration of unconstitutional the Sectoral Conference on Sport They may not know that it has existed since 2008 under the name of the Interterritorial Conference on Sport and the role of coordination between the State and the Autonomous Communities And by the way to this day there is no complaint about such a conference by this ultra- left independentist and republican formation It is possible that the Republican Parliamentary Group does not want coordination between the State and the autonomous communities in this area which is why they have not said anything in the last fourteen years of the existence of this body In short accepting the fundamental theses of the Republican Parliamentary Group would mean recognizing that the Spanish State lacks the power to legislate in the field of sports which is what they would like but unfortunately for them this debate was closed long ago by the Constitutional Court Although there have been a number of rulings by the Constitutional Court in this area I can only cite three rulings The first of 1986 of 10 January The Constitutional Court held that the statutory attribution of exclusive competence in sport to the autonomous communities must on the one hand connect with the autonomous competences and on the other with the general interests of the Spanish sport as a whole whose defence and promotion will then be the responsibility of the State This ruling resolved precisely a conflict between the Generalitat de Catalunya and the possible Catalan federal participation in international competitions when the corresponding Spanish sports federation did not appear Here the Constitutional Court emphasized that the possible administrative intervention cannot be the responsibility of the authorities of the autonomous community since there are interests that are characteristic of the Spanish federated sport as a whole Second judgment 8/2012 of 18 April The High Court stated that even the powers which have been defined as exclusive to the autonomous communities must be exercised with respect to the powers which may fall to the State in accordance with the principle of territorial competences as something implicit in the system of autonomy itself And he added that the very polyhedral reality of sports matter in its different facets health education culture research physical education regulated professions or commercial legislation necessarily determines the concurrence of the various public administrations state autonomous and local Moreover in some cases it requires a comprehensive and non-fragmented approach because it involves actions in which the subject matter of sport is intertwined with another subject that is competently attributed to the State such as for example the special link between sport and health Finally in judgement 16/1996 of 1 February three Republicans the Constitutional Court declared that the State has jurisdiction over certain matters particularly education and culture which may also affect sport All this without prejudice to the specific powers conferred on the State by Law 10/1990 on Sport He added that the said law was adopted in order to manage the sport in accordance with the competences of the State administration and coordination with the autonomous communities and where appropriate with local corporations which could directly and manifestly affect the general interests of the sport at the national level The Constitutional Court recalled that this law was not the subject of any criticism by any autonomous community nor was its predecessor Law 13/1980 of 31 March In conclusion and with this we close our argument of opposition to the amendment to the entire Republican Group the Constitutional Court has made it more than clear that the exercise of the powers assumed as exclusive by the autonomous communities in their respective statutes of autonomy limits the exercise of the powers of the State From my parliamentary group VOX we will always propose policies of national unity because all Spaniards have the same rights and we must also have them in sport and because it is what Spanish sport needs and deserves against all those who want to divide us continuously in search of their own economic and partisan interest very proper to this social communist government and its independent and bi-dutar partners That is why we are going to say openly to this amendment as a whole No Thank you
"With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Foral Community of Navarre the VOX Parliamentary Group has tabled an amendment to the full return to the Government of the draft law amending Law 28/1990 of 26 December approving the Economic Convention between the State and the Foral Community of Navarre My parliamentary group has opposed its direct processing and single reading because we believe that although the Constitutional Court has endorsed the use of this special procedure for this type of legislation it is no less true that nothing prevents the use of the ordinary legislative procedure A procedure is being used to allow the plenary in a single debate to approve an initiative without having to go through the previous steps of the Commission and the Commission This fact has been unanimously criticised by the doctrine an objection which we share in its entirety in so far as it imposes a severe restriction on the legislative powers of Members and groups and results in the exercise of the legislative function of this Parliament In this sense the House 's activity is limited to a single examination and vote on the initiative taken so that the condition on the power of debate and parliamentary discussion is clear to such an extent that some authors argue that the use of this procedure makes the House a mere body of ratification or rejection restricting its own deliberative capacity Ladies and gentlemen today we are going to pass a law of which we have no more information than that derived from its own text because once again the debate has been stolen from this Parliament and any explanation has been avoided as to the technical aspects of the proposed reform its economic and social impact as well as the calculation of its contribution to the Navarra Foral Community The equations and variables to be taken into account for the calculation of the foral contribution reveal a mathematical maze of impossible understanding for ordinary citizens On June 7 2018 the newly appointed Minister of Finance Maria Jesús Montero said publicly that the issue of the Basque quota on which she had shown reluctance in the past must be transparent she said that the autonomous communities had had manifestly insufficient resources in recent years and she advocated with regard to the Basque quota and the Navarra contribution why it is clearly explained how their calculations are carried out Literally he said It has to be explained transparently how calculations are made It has never been fully explained how the services provided by the State are valued It is important that it is taken into account at this moment when we live Where is that transparency Minister Again opacity opacity and opacity It is the most opaque government in Spanish democratic history and it is not acceptable for members of the Congress of Deputies to ignore the tricks traps and some falsehoods contained in the law that we are discussing today Minister we want light where you want darkness Ladies and gentlemen for this new amendment of the economic agreement with Navarre and it is the sixth as the Minister has already said the Government is delegating new powers to the outside community in tax matters extending in various ways the assumptions that fall under its competence some as relevant as allowing the region to manage VAT on electronic commerce and so called Tobin and Google fees In doing so the Government is delving into the serious asymmetries between the common system and the foral regime which in turn involve significant inequalities between the Spanish and grant unjustified financial privileges to those subject to the foral regime In the face of this VOX proposes a State at the service of the unit of Spain in which there are no differences between regions or between Spaniards depending on the place in which they reside or work On the contrary it is necessary to strengthen links between Spaniards and ensure equality between them in order to ensure the prosperity coexistence and well being of our homeland and to achieve a modern State in which there are no eighteen different legal systems It is clear that the persistence of alleged regional historical rights covered by the first additional provision of the Constitution which translates into the existence of a peculiar fiscal regime only deepens the inequality between the Spanish It is therefore necessary to abolish legal privileges such as the one constituted by the economic agreement which in the present case involves opposing the processing of this bill which postulates its updating Ladies and gentlemen the bill is also a further sign of the inconsistency that characterizes the Spanish left In November 2017 the current Minister of Finance and Public Service Maria Jesús Montero asked the then Minister Mr Montoro when she was a Finance Advisor of the Board of Andalusia who will end the outlaw privileges and literally demanded that she Address a recalculation of the Basque quota and the Navarra contribution so that the recognition of their outlaw rights do not translate into unjustified financial privileges Obviously the Minister 's request today did not provide for the future government of her party to rest in the PNV and EH Bildu Alain Cuenca director general of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and secretary of the committee of experts for tax reform already in 2017 denounced to the Ombudsman the unconstitutionality of the system and stated literally the following The calculation of the Basque quota presents errors errors and invented data and allows the Basque Country and also Navarre to receive money from the rest of Spain Ladies and gentlemen Article 31 of the Spanish Constitution stipulates that all Spaniards shall contribute to the maintenance of public expenditure in accordance with their economic capacity through a fair tax system inspired by the principles of equality and progressive This equality must be interpreted in accordance with article 14 which states Spanish are equal before the law without discrimination on grounds of nationality race sex religion opinion or any other personal or social condition or circumstance Also in line with article 139 according to which All Spaniards have the same rights and obligations in any part of the territory of the State Together with the principle of equality between all Spaniards the principle of interterritorial solidarity set out in article 138 of the Constitution requires the State to ensure 'an adequate and fair economic balance between the various parts of the Spanish territory which implies that the differences between the statutes of the different autonomous communities cannot in any case imply economic or social privileges Well such rules are exceptions for the Basque and Navarra provinces with the first additional provision of the Constitution a special law without comparison in comparative law to which the tenor the Constitution protects and respects the historical rights of the outlying territories Ladies and gentlemen asymmetries which involve significant inequalities between Spaniards and privileges for those subject to the outlaw regime have been repeatedly highlighted by both the doctrine and the national and European courts Some examples that this is a privileged system for Navarre are as follows First example de facto separated marriage with two minor children The husband resides outside the Community of Navarre and the wife with the children in Navarra territory If the children are dependent on him it shall be understood that the husband also resides in Navarre for tax purposes article 8.3 b of Law 28/1990 Second example marriage that opts for joint taxation The wife usually works and resides in Logroño has annual gross salaries of 45 000 euros and her liquidated base for the purposes of IRPF is 27 000 according to her personal circumstances and the regulations of La Rioja The husband usually works and resides in Pamplona has an annual gross remuneration of 40,000 euros that is 5000 less than his wife and his liquidated base for the purposes of IRPF is 29,000 euros that is 2000 more than his wife 's according in fact to his personal circumstances and to Navarra 's tax regulations It is therefore for the Foral Community of Navarre to levy the tax and this is determined by Article 9.2 of Law 28/1990 Third example a company with a registered office and a prosecutor in Madrid and which temporarily operates exclusively in Navarre although its social purpose allows it to do so throughout the national territory Its total volume of operations in the previous year has exceeded EUR 10 million and taxed corporation tax in Navarre Article 19.1 b of Law 28/1990 Fourth and last example wooden furniture manufacturing company with registered office in Santander The furniture is manufactured in its Santander factory but is varnished and packaged for distribution to retailers on a ship located in Pamplona and the latter accounts for approximately 12 of the total manufacturing process An operation carried out in Navarre for tax purposes Article 21 A 1st of Law 28/1990 In short a modern State needs to be at the service of unity and equality and should not be subject to different tax regimes for the different regions which protected from a supposed historical origin perpetuate inequalities between Spaniards distort national unity and make some Spaniards better than others because they were born in one or another region Thus VOX understands that equality between Spaniards and national unity makes it necessary to oppose this regime and any of its renewals On the basis of the foregoing we call for the Government to be returned to the draft law which is the subject of this amendment I shall conclude Mr President Thank God in Spain as in Europe is the time of patriots Thank you very much"
With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen it is very clear to us that an abuse is taking place today as the spokesman for the Citizens Parliamentary Group said earlier What the Socialist Group has done in dealing with this motion for a law is shameful it has stolen the debate in this Parliament they have used in a way we could say fraudulently the possibilities given by the Rules of Procedure of the House and now I will explain to you why The Socialist Parliamentary Group registered a bill to amend an article in the transparency law to oblige public administrations to publish statistics and other data in relation to public contracts they held with micro small and medium sized enterprises Well since it was a single article and it was a very decaffeinated thing it was decided that it would be passed on to the Commission with full legislative competence that is that it did not have to go back to this plenary for approval In considering the proposal for a law which is the only debate we have had we referred to what was the amendment of that article of the law on transparency and they already warned that it was not much use to publish statistics because what small and medium sized enterprises needed as we had urged and did not listen to us was a real plan that would avoid the late payment of public contracts by public administrations which is the most late we have in Spain public administrations and with a sanctioning regime in such a way that the administration would be punished for failing to comply with that plan that would avoid the late payment of public contracts Well we abstained and passed on to the Commission the deadline for amendments was opened and the Socialist Group is presenting us with an amendment for an idea to be made the proposal for a law was a leaf and a half of nine sheets of amendment of a tax figure the tax on fluorinated gases which is actually creating a new tax because the amendment is such a large one modifies essential elements such as the tax fact among other issues which is actually repealing the previous regulation of the previous tax and creating a completely new tax figure On the other hand the Government of the nation was processing a bill that was identical to the amendment submitted and instead of following the procedure because they did not like the result of the public information because they had the affected sectors confronted they decided to sneak through the back door by amendment in a single article bill proposal that will be seen in the Commission With full legislative competence the creation of a tax figure without economic memory without reporting any kind of social impact or other order without the result of the previous information to which the bill had already been submitted in its process that is shame It is an outrage they are stealing as I said at the beginning the debate in this Parliament The legislative presentation was immediately constituted The first thing the PSOE representative said was let 's vote It was voted and it is clear with the majority of Frankenstein that the amendment is approved incorporated into the rapporteur 's report and quickly and nightly we are called to the Commission for the amendments which had remained alive after a long plenary session after nine o'clock in the evening We were asked to be brief in the speeches of course it was already more than nine o'clock in the evening when we had requested that it be suspended and called for another day but there quickly in a flat fold the bill was passed and its passage into the Senate In the Senate the Socialists have had the bad luck that two amendments have been adopted and that is why it is coming today because today we must introduce these two amendments so that the law can be sanctioned and enacted In other words a tax figure is created without debate in this Parliament We have not been able to discuss the substance we have not been able to amend the substance of the tax figure in this Parliament and this leads us once again to reaffirm that VOX is right when he says that we are faced with an autonomous regime on whose front there is a genuine autocrat because in his eagerness to co-opt all the institutions he is already laughing at the separation of powers and this is another test Then the Presidency will say that we withdraw from the Journal of Sessions that it is an autarchy and that at the head of it there is a genuine autocrat I hope that the same measuring rod will be used when we are called fascists sexists racists xenophobics because it offends us It offends me because I do not consider myself a fascist a sexist a xenophobic or a homophobic And as I am offended and as it goes beyond what should be a rational criterion of freedom of expression in this House if it is decided to remove from the Journal of Sessions that the President is an autocrat that every time he qualifies us as fascists sexists racist homophobes etc. he also removes himself from the Journal of Sessions because the offence is the same And if not it will be credited that from this institution unfortunately one collaborates with the autarchy We already saw it in its day two years ago when this Parliament was closed a measure which was very criticized and annulled by the Constitutional Court Thank you very much
With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen for once some people will find it strange to say this I agree with what Mr Bel has said Indeed I thought we were going to come here and listen to the spokesman for the PSOE to present a proposal for a law on the amendment of the Law on Transparency and Good Governance to collect the obligation to make statistics on the volume of public procurement that affects micro small and medium sized enterprises and we have found that Mr Del Valle not me the other that of the PSOE has given us a campaign rally on Castile and León So that 's why I said I 'd match up for once with Mr. Bel I focus on the subject on what is on the agenda We have already stated on several occasions that at that time one of the previous speakers has also seen it this way what concerns small and medium sized enterprises most about their relationship with public administrations and with the whole network of public bodies and enterprises is the lack of diligence in the payment of public procurement prices There is tremendous delay and not only that but in specific public works there are works that had small implementation times that affect small and medium sized enterprises and that in many cases have had to be abandoned As early as April the VOX Parliamentary Group proposed a non-legislative proposal that the Government would take steps to avoid such late payment by public administrations to small and medium sized enterprises and self employed and was rejected with the votes of the entire left of this House In June in the Committee on Industry Trade and Tourism when the proposal for a law on which this proposal is based was debated and approved we also tabled an amendment not only calling for a late payment plan to avoid this delay in the payment of public procurement prices affecting micro small and medium sized enterprises but also a sanctioning regime and its Socialist Party members members of that committee did not want to accept the amendment They preferred to accept a light decaffeinated amendment in which it was only mentioned that the Government was being urged to take steps to avoid that lateness but they did not at all want to pick up the punishing party which we believe is essential On the other hand just over a month ago in this same Chamber we were discussing a non-legislative proposal on the possibility of amending the Law on Public Sector Contracts as well as the Law on Desindexation of the Spanish Economy in the sense that the requirements that the current legislation requires for the modification of prices and public contracts which as was said here mainly affected small and medium sized enterprises because it is the small and medium sized enterprises that are suffering the most from the rise of materials the other day we heard that aluminum has risen by over 200 wood by 70 They 're crazy prices and it's those small and medium sized enterprises which you say you want to help the ones that are suffering them Well that non-law proposal was also rejected by your left wing lordships And now they talk here about wanting to help small and medium sized enterprises which want small and medium sized enterprises to be awarded public contracts and the only thing they bring is that they publish statistics on the volume of public procurement that affects them and they also do so by amending the Law on Transparency and Good Governance rather than the Law on Public Sector Contracts And I was wondering why and I have the clear answer they want to wash their image They are the most opaque government in the history of democracy in Spain They appointed a President of the Transparency and Good Government Council who was rejected by the transparency associations The press immediately pulled headlines saying that he was a person linked to the Spanish Socialist Workers Party and that he could not chair a council whose function is among other things the control of the Government He gave them the same they appointed him and the first thing he did was to go to Mrs Calvo 's office then Vice President of the Government and then to Mr Bolaños then Secretary General of the Presidency of the Government to receive political slogans for the next day to ceas the Deputy Director General of Complaints of the Transparency Council Mrs Zambrano because she had dared to ask the data of the use of the Falcon by the President of the Government and because she had given the Government a period of ten days to present the list of those unknown members of the advisory commission in the first part of the VOCID pandemic It was fulminated There were headlines throughout the press I liked Digital Journalist the most who said that the dirt on the Transparency Council does n't even go with Cillit Bang That 's magnificent But there have been all kinds of them It is rare that with the amount of subsidies you give to the media there has been unanimity in which there is dirt and little transparency As I have little time left although another spokesman has already said I would like to remind you of what the ABC said yesterday 1200 proceedings against the Transparency Act And besides they use
...a Francoist law of official secrets which must give them rashes Nothing more and thank you very much
"I 've seen things you would n't believe Attack ships in flames beyond Orion I 've seen C rays shine in the dark near Tannhäuser Gate I have seen in these strange days I have seen it Mr Rufián defend the family even with jacket and tie I have seen a spokesman of We can deny that he was ever liberal when he was and the other declare that he is when he has never been I have seen the PP defend the nuclear after closing Garoña and having celebrated it I have seen the Minister of Defense say that there were mafias of human trafficking after having called us xenophobes to say the same thing months before I have seen the Minister for Transitional Ecology criticise the European Union for the green classification of nuclear energy by the way without anyone calling it a hydrophobic I have seen the First Vice President of the Economy admit that inflation will be unravelled for months after being for months denying us and touching us by saying what was coming And I have seen I swear to you that I have seen the President of the Government the same one who said that the Ministry of Defence had to close now defend VOX 's old proposal to invest at least 2 of the gross domestic product in the Ministry of Defence assuming one of our own points Yes I have seen things that you would not believe to all who insulted us to assume our postulates with a few months of delay All those moments in which we were criticized will be lost in time like tears in the rain because this debate has served to remind us that in so many things VOX was right Today after seeing what we have all seen some motions for resolutions are debated and voted in this House Ours is necessarily of total rejection it 's called that and that 's how we feel about it I believe that our first obligation is to claim the role of this House the role of the Legislature which is more important than ever because never before had a President of the Government come this far At the request of VOX the Constitutional Court censored that Pedro Sánchez had cancelled control of Congress at the time when the executive had accumulated more power in the history of democracy Never before had a President of the Government so boldly swept the work of the Courts through the abuse of the use of the figure of the royal decree law never before had the activity of this House been so cynically hijacked with the blocking of the processing of more than fifty rules with the rank of law and never before had Congress been subjected to the blackmail to which this Government is subject We remember that for the reception of European funds this government has committed itself in Brussels without even asking here to pass more than sixty rules with a law rank that can only be passed in this House Ladies and gentlemen in democracy respect for the separation of powers is not a whim it is not an option it is not an accident it is a basic foundation of the health of the rule of law and the government without respecting that principle has only one name and that name is that of autocrat That is why this debate on motions for resolutions cannot be held without a previous demand that the role that should never have been lost be returned to this House Ladies and gentlemen Spain is going badly The context is not easy the truth but it is difficult to imagine a Government capable of aggravating things further to put us in a worse political economic social and institutional situation and frankly I find it difficult to imagine such unbelievable unself critical self congratulating and substantial motions for resolutions as have been brought to this Parliament by the parliamentary groups supporting this Government Since VOX we have presented yes a total global and frontal rejection to the direction in which they want to continue to lead our country Spain needs to leave behind the ideological sectarianism that for decades driven by the left and assumed by the right wing so called has turned Spain into a frustrated experiment of the evil so called feminism of the climate religion of relativism and of globalism so that from now on it can begin to attend to what really represent national emergencies We refer to them in our motions for resolutions Ladies and gentlemen Spain cannot continue to be subjected to a continuous and structural blackmail accepted by Pedro Sánchez which has made the governability of our country depend precisely on those who want to end it on those who just a year ago gave a coup d'état in Catalonia or on the political arm of ETA Spain cannot be in the hands of those who want to destroy it ladies and gentlemen That is why as the rest of the Western countries are already doing it is urgent to put an end to a design problem that is structural The Constitution says its article 2 is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation and that unity is being violated ladies and gentlemen In the motions for resolutions of the VOX Group we want to ensure that the Spanish people are equal where they live and refer to different areas in the health field for example by providing a portfolio of common services throughout Spain or in the field of water policy by guaranteeing the supply of water to all Spaniards through the implementation of a national hydrological plan But we must also ensure in other areas that the Spaniards are once again equal before the law as guaranteed by article 14 of our Constitution because ladies and gentlemen gender laws which establish a presumption of truth to a party to the party who denounces erode the procedural guarantees of the defendant trampling on the most elementary principles of the law established more than two thousand years ago The gender laws that preach real equality attack above all this fundamental value that of equality generating different legal consequences in the face of the same acts Gender laws which claim to defend victims leave many victims who have been declared by the left that they appear to deserve less protection women attacked by men who are not their partners or by other women who are mothers or grandmothers abused by their children women attacked by strangers Do n't they deserve the same protection We therefore call for the repeal of gender laws and their replacement by a domestic violence law the abolition of the Ministry of Equality and the end of indoctrination in the classrooms Our third motion for a resolution refers to economic policy or rather to its absence Ladies and gentlemen it 's not Putin it 's not Franco and it's not the virus It is you Pedro Sánchez your Government and your erratic economic policy that explains to a great extent the biggest economic collapse in any country first the delay in recovery then and finally that Spain will be the last OECD country to recover its pre-crisis GDP level which will not reach until 2024 Ladies and gentlemen this government has triggered public debt putting it in a situation of extreme vulnerability From 35 of the debt on GDP that we had in 2017 the debt has increased to 118 in 2021 but it is that the AIReF warns of the consolidation of a structural deficit that would trigger the debt in the medium term up to 140 But the worst is that today there are forty thousand companies less than before the pandemic and on top of that they are now paying more taxes than ever with a greater debt that unfortunately they will not be able to pay and merely trying to survive Nor has this government been able to prevent or at least moderate the impoverishment that is causing inflation which was not a cyclical or transitory phenomenon and which reached 10.2 in June its highest level in thirty seven years The result is that far from recovering the levels of the pandemic with the highest unemployment rate in Europe with a fiscal effort 11 points higher and without reducing political spending we have been placed in a compromised situation which will not be corrected by assaulting the National Institute of Statistics We have been demanding it and we reiterate it today because there is no time to waste the Government must speed up structural reforms stop attacking those who employ and generate wealth and develop a medium and long term fiscal strategy that realistically and crediblely guarantees the sustainability of public accounts But that of course would begin by putting an end to the Government of the twenty two ministries and to the greater political spending of democracy by undoing the client network that has so boldly articulated and by renouncing those thousands of advisers political positions and privileges on which this first government of the coalition of democracy has based He has no authority to demand an income pact that has deployed the greatest political expense in history which in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Civil War has not hesitated to raise its salary and who has turned its day to day into a parade of privileges such as the obscene trip to New York in Falcon of those who said they renounce the privilege of taxi Ladies and gentlemen we have to choose either the welfare state or the welfare of politicians and in VOX we have no doubt That is why we urgently propose to carry out an audit of public expenditure and to eliminate any unnecessary political expenditure in particular for political parties trade unions and employers which should be financed from the funds of their membership quotas We must recover the holy fear of deficit an expression so old that some of you will not even be remembered as you will not remember the last time Spain had a surplus You would all be fired in any company that throws red numbers year after year as its managers continue to squander the money of their shareholders which in this case ladies and gentlemen are the Spaniards Spain must regain the lost confidence and for that in addition to regaining the balance of public accounts it must regain the prestige of its institutions The deterioration to which Pedro Sánchez has been subjected to our institutions the Ministry of Public Prosecutions the Attorney General 's Office the CIS Spanish Radiotelevision the Civil Guard the Court of Auditors the National Market Commission even strategic companies such as Indra but also the Bank of Spain the AIReF or the Constitutional Court itself which they now want to control is unqualified None of them have escaped Pedro Sánchez 's control attempt or his maneuvers to control them But most particularly the assault on the judiciary must be halted The institutions must be shielded from the interference of the Government which is also indeed a national emergency We cannot wait any longer we must reform the system of election of the members of the governing body of judges so that judges are elected by the judges and from among the judges It must be ensured that the investigation of criminal proceedings continues to be conducted by judges and not by the Ministry of Public Prosecutions which we already know is dependent on We must put an end to the politicization of the Constitutional Court and demand that it settle judgements expeditiously not by ten years of delay in some cases And it is that the good functioning of the judicial system is vital for the health of democracy as is the good functioning of the energy market for its economic sustainability Ladies and gentlemen this government 's energy policy is a major waste of money When they brought their climate change law we were the only ones to oppose the self injury assumed in the name of climate religion and the only ones to defend our energy sovereignty and not the progressive ideas that are condemning our homes and our industry to ruin We denounce the unwillingness to give up even to ban the exploitation and exploration of our own resources while China and India fire to infinity their emissions or while we buy from France and Morocco nuclear and coal energy respectively Today once again reason is imposed Today once again VOX was right Spain pays the most expensive electricity in Europe and Europe rectifies and declares gas and nuclear as green energy even if you do not like it But the Spaniards do n't have to pay for their climate dogmatism on the bill for light Therefore we propose to implement urgently a national energy sovereignty plan that prioritizes the interests of Spain and the Spanish because it is common sense Spain 's interest should also have governed our foreign policy but it has not The Government has preferred to devote our foreign action to promoting its ideological dogmas in a feminist foreign policy And what results have we achieved In just four years the Government of Pedro Sánchez has laid waste to a position of more than three hundred years in Gibraltar has handed over Western Sahara to Morocco putting an end to the position maintained by Spain for almost fifty years and leaving in the wrong place one of our largest gas suppliers and has squandered Spain 's position of prestige in relation to Ibero America maintaining a double game with the worst Ibero American dictatorships and abandoning our Cuban Venezuelan or Nicaraguan brothers And when it seemed impossible to go beyond it it has betrayed our allies in the war of Ukraine firing gas purchases to Russia and dragging feet in the shipment of material to Ukraine Spain has to regain its lost international prestige be recognized by our partners as a reliable partner and expressly assert our interests on the world stage And that also implies responsibility That 's why VOX has been defending increasing defence investment for a long time reaching 2 of GDP Once again VOX was alone defending the need to provide our Armed Forces with the necessary resources That is why we are glad today that many of you are right when you rectify This is also the case with immigration For years VOX alone warned about the effects of the migration invasion encouraged for decades which is adding to our neighborhoods which do not dignify to tread the political elites in very dangerous areas Therefore you do not hesitate to propose a massive regularization or to propose the repopulation of Spain abandoned with waves of immigrants That is why its 2050 Plan calls for 250,000 emigrants to be attracted in the coming years And that is why we refuse to see what is happening in the multicultural ghettos which are already a threat to the safety of our citizens in many European cities"
For allusions Article 71 I would like to clarify to Congresswoman Padilla that it is true that this parliamentary group defends a model different from the autonomous model that is contained in the Constitution but by constitutional means
victims who have not been compensated for having met certain legal deadlines by the courts Nothing more
Thank you Madam President We are very interested in everything that relates to nature conservation and indeed to the right of the disabled to enjoy nature You progressives believe you have the monopoly of love for nature the monopoly of ecological concern but remember where the word ecology comes from it comes from oikos which in Greek means home That 's something he always liked to remind conservative philosopher Roger Scruton He maintained that the basic attitude of the conservative was precisely ecology that is love of the home The basic attitude of the conservative is gratitude gratitude to all that our ancestors have bequeathed to us and what the ancestors have bequeathed to us includes not only a way of life not only moral norms institutions but also natural places and there is no contradiction in that We have also received natural sites from the ancestors mountains rivers and forests In the Anthropocene there is no more virgin nature in the strict sense every landscape is a human landscape even if it is only to the extent that man has deliberately decided to respect it The basic attitude of progressives on the other hand is contempt for the past You progressives see the past as a long night of machism class domination racism homophobia The problem of progressiveism is that as always the past was worse than the present they are condemned to be despised by the progressives of the future This was said very well by Gómez Dávila who wrote progressiveism ages badly Each generation brings a new model of progressiveism that defies the previous one There is one aspect of this GNP that does not convince us and that is that it is drafted in such a way that it seems to attribute to NGOs or the Biodiversity Foundation or not well defined entities the power to declare visitors outside beautiful places that may be privately owned In this way the alleged right to universal accessibility can become an alibi for the emptying of private property de facto expropriation In fact the Anglo Saxon world is already talking about the right to roaming that is the right to wander around the neighbor 's estate on the pretext that it is beautiful and that beauty is of everyone But above all there is one aspect of this GNP which is particularly incongruent to us as in general all that you do about the rights of the disabled and that is that you are concerned about the right of the disabled to access national parks but not the right of the disabled to life to access life because if the disabled are not allowed to be born how can they go to national parks And remember that there are forms of disability with a genetic basis that are disappearing in Spain but not because they no longer give but because those who suffer from it are exterminated in the womb It is estimated that between 90 and 95 of Down syndrome fetuses for example are aborted in Spain at present There is one European country that has already reached 100 per cent In Iceland children with Down syndrome are no longer born and all are destroyed in the womb Of course Icelandic society would have made Rosenberg Himmler and the other Nazi hierarchs pale with envy Because the Nazis sought a society without disabilities a society formed only by healthy individuals what happens is that they practiced postnatal eugenics and in very civilized and progressive Europe we are practicing prenatal eugenics You are progressive you are considered the champions of equality and inclusiveness Well this selective extermination of the disabled in the mother 's womb is being facilitated by a eugenic law such as the current abortion law which provides for a longer special period of no less than twenty two weeks for fetuses suffering from some malformation i.e. some disability Needless to say at twenty two weeks a fetus sucks its finger a fetus can yawn can play with the umbilical cord and of course can feel pain PNL it has already finished talks about the need to speak with the leaders of disability associations Well talk for example
Ladies and gentlemen we need to re-fashion marriage and fatherhood among young people Survival as a nation is in it for us Thank you
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen It is up to me to intervene to defend our proposal for a law on the reform of the procedure for granting nationality In his speech against Cayo Verres Cicero argued that the Roman civil formula sum I am a Roman citizen was to be a shield against arbitrariness at any point in the ancient world any point in the Mediterranean of the first century before Christ as Saint Paul could see when he was saved from the scourge to which he was about to be subjected by invoking his status as a Roman citizen President Kennedy in his famous speech to the Berlin Wall in 1963 held that the contemporary equivalent of Romanus sum civilians would be the phrase Ich bin ein Berliner I am a Berliner However these ancestors of ours knew very well that citizenship was a privilege and that therefore implied not only rights as we tend to believe today that we see citizenship as a kind of care worker but also duties In the case of Kennedy the counterpart of German honorary citizenship was the commitment to defend Berlin that islet of freedom in the communist ocean even with nuclear weapons In the case of Cicero the reverse of Roman civilians sum was that of dolce et decorum est pro patria mori that is there is a duty to defend the homeland even with life itself to defend this homeland that guarantees freedom In the debate that took place last week in the Madrid Assembly on the two deaths caused by the umpteenth street battle between Latin gangs Mrs. Díaz Ayuso said two things firstly she said that crime had nothing to do with the country of origin secondly she said that some of the members of those gangs were Spanish Well in relation to the first one it must be said that it is simply not true it is statistically unquestionable that foreigners residing in Spain commit crimes more frequently than Spaniards without this implying in any way that a majority of foreigners are criminals In particular resident foreigners account for 11.4 of the population and however 29 of the prison population from which a crime rate of about three times that of the Spanish population can be inferred This overrepresentation is even more pronounced in some groups for example the crime rate of Colombians is 4.3 times higher than that of Spaniards that of Moroccans is 4.1 times higher and that of Nigerians is 8.4 times higher If we move on to the most serious crimes which involve a sentence of more than five years then the disproportion is even more pronounced as can be seen in this graph That is men of American origin have a crime rate 10.6 times higher than Spaniards and men of African origin5 or 6 times higher The progress consensus tries to explain this over representation on the basis of poverty ignorance etc. but there was a time when the Spaniards were also poor and ignorant and yet we did not form gangs of murderers neither in Spain nor in the countries to which we emigrated Therefore the true explanation is cultural many of these immigrants come from the most violent countries in the world and the mentality of a person does not change by the art of magic by setting foot on Spanish land For example the homicide rate in El Salvador is 100 times higher than in Spain Of course they must not pay righteous for sinners as I said before Of course a majority of immigrants are not criminals but it is of particular interest to that honest majority that strict immigration controls be established that prevent their compatriots from entering Spain to defile the good name of their country of origin thus projecting an unjust collective suspicion on all The other thing Mrs. Ayuso said is that some of the Dominican Don't Play in this case are Spanish I guess I meant some of them have the Spanish DNI Well for us to be Spanish is much more than having a role Moreover such persons should never have obtained such a role We do not want criminals to be able to obtain Spanish nationality we do not want the savagery that only a month ago attacked with a baseball bat and then raped an octogenarian in Alicante could become Spanish one day we do not want the members of La Manada de Azuqueca who raped anally and vaginally in shifts at a 12 year old girl to ever be Spanish The reform we are proposing seeks to change the procedure for the award of Spanish nationality We think that the nation is not stamped paper we think that the nation is a moral community it is a historical project a suggestive historical project said Ortega and Gasset in invertebrate Spain it is a historical enterprise and therefore cannot be open to anyone The specific changes we include relate for example to the time limits for obtaining nationality by residence The ordinary term is extended from 10 to 15 years the reduced time limits for persons who have obtained refugee status we leave them equal in 5 years and also the reduced time limits for citizens of Ibero American Filipino Ecuadorian or Portuguese origin But we add new requirements such as for example for the acquisition of nationality by residence a certificate proving the lack of a criminal record both in the country of origin and in Spain and in the case of non-Hispano Americans an official language certificate proving their mastery of the Spanish language and also overcoming a test of knowledge of Spanish history the Constitution and culture We also add an assumption of loss of nationality by sanction for those who have dual nationality namely those who commit crimes or are sentenced to a final sentence for crimes against the Constitution public order independence from Spain or treason offences There are already districts in Madrid such as Usera which have up to 58 foreign residents The consensus progresses rejoices in this abundance of new Spaniards of the most diverse origins the consensus progress seems to not care if these new Spaniards share our culture our customs or even our language Last week my colleague Rocío de Meer held in this very rostrum that what it seems is to progressively turn nations into neutral containers devoid of identity and to be replenishable with people of any cultural origin and whoever dares to question this radiant multicultural future will automatically be mocked as racist Former Czech President Václav Klaus has said that pseudo religious worship of diversity as a value in itself is preventing rational debate on the migration issue so I recommend to the left wing gentlemen that they travel through this new multicultural Europe and will be able to check their failure I will read a quote that is not mine I open quotes The Arabs will never integrate into French society Integration is possible between Europeans because the cultural fabric is the same but here we are talking about another continent another religion they will be bad French they will never be French 100 percent I close quotes This is not said by Eric Zemmour or Jean Marie Le Pen this was said by King Hassan II of Morocco in an interview given to Anne Sinclair Some will say well integration will come over time No it 's not like that either integration does n't always come with time It has been found that the second or third generation of immigrants are often less integrated than their parents or grandparents it is a phenomenon to which Georges Bensoussan has referred as dissimilarity The French Muslims practice endogamy marry each other by 90 in sporting events they boocheaLa Marsellesa and vitore the anthems of Algeria or Morocco in terrorist attacks against Charlie Hebdo magazine or the Bataclan discotheque and others several of the perpetrators were second generation immigrants already born in France with the French passport there are areas of Paris such as Bradford or Malmö which already look more like the Maghreb than Europe areas where women no longer dare to go out alone or only go out with a male companion I recommend reading this book Prey by Ayaan Hirsi Ali which is one of the most interesting liberal intellectuals at the present time It is of Somali origin with which I imagine they will not call it white supremacist In this book it explains precisely how the migratory avalanche that has fallen on Europe over the last ten years has led to a deterioration in women 's security and an increase in sexual violence Women in many European cities already have to avoid certain neighborhoods and do not dare to run to the park or if they do it is with anti-rape sports clothing equipped with alarms in case of tearing The number of violations in Denmark increased by 102 between 2014 and 2017 coinciding with the arrival of the large avalanche of alleged Middle East refugees In the United Kingdom violations rose by 70 over the same period On New Year 's Eve 2015 the hundreds of alleged Middle East refugees who had recently arrived in Germany practiced in cities such as Cologne Düsseldorf etc. the taharrush gamemea that is sexual harassment in herd against hundreds of German youths however the matter was covered up both by the police and by the German press so as not to feed xenophobia And what is the reaction of consensus progress against all this Well to say that it's our fault that it 's the fault of the host society because we 're very racist and we 're not quite hospitable This is a simple suicide reaction Italian intellectual Renato Crispín has said that today 's Europe has two major diseases One of them is oicophobia that is hatred of one 's own origins hatred of one 's own roots and hatred of oneself and the other is xenophilia which is the acritic beatification of the stranger something that by the way Pope Benedict XVI also said in a quote I do n't have time to read We do n't think it 's our fault
now they have planned the dismantling between 2027 and 2037 of which we have left Fortunately we will take them out before power and they will not be able to consummate the disguise Thank you
have its location and that will only result in losses that the State the State already alone will bear because the shareholders have lost everything they had to put on and the private ones withdraw We cannot participate as you will understand in this assault on public flows perhaps you do because you have done so in the past Thank you very much
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I will not explain to you what the proposal is about today those who have already spoken to me have already explained it In any case Mr Rego you begin by saying that you are not going to talk about what you do not know but the only thing you have done is a genuine exercise of ignorance starting with the article you are presenting Today he has explained to us very well the difference between a credit section and a cooperative well he has not explained it well but he has distinguished the two figures However you in the article you propose say 4 This law will not apply to loan contracts g granted by the cooperative credit sections to their own cooperative partners and here comes the error 'as long as they are cooperatives set up for a social purpose other than the professional provision of financial services Look if they were engaged in the professional provision of financial services they'd be credit unions they could n't be credit sections okay But I have seen that today you have already begun to distinguish the one that you did not distinguish was Mrs Garrido in the exhibition that you made us As some of those who have spoken before me have told you Mr Martínez Oblanca for example this is not a rule that benefits big people as they have said it is a rule that benefits consumers You do n't think I 'm suspicious of your proposal And you know why not Because I am very much in favour of deregulation and because I believe that the financial sector is overly regulated But of course when they apply to you it turns out perhaps because in your constituency you have up to five credit sections in a province It 's a very high number You know that it is basically in the Mediterranean arc where there are many and in Catalonia where credit sections break and I tell you this because Mr López Bas has warned you that credit sections sometimes break That is why I cannot understand why you also require me to decafeate your controls Credit sections sometimes break down they 're very dangerous I tell you I do n't see it wrong for two reasons because we are great supporters of the social economy and because we also believe that things are very regulated excessively regulated Nor can it be said as has been said here that Spanish mortgage regulation is No Spanish mortgage regulation was and is one of the best in the world and has allowed a lot of mortgage credit at very low cost regardless of what happened in the crisis We 've forgotten that You keep talking about banking crisis maybe because you do n't distinguish a credit section from a cooperative The crisis was n't banking it was basically savings banks The entities that were saved were banks i.e. credit institutions in the form of an anonymous company and rural boxes working boxes professional boxes i.e. credit cooperatives And do you know why credit unions and banks were saved Because they own it because they own it As for savings banks as they did not own them politicians basically devoted themselves to assaulting them The credit sections do not cease to be what they have explained a small closed universe where some co-operatives deposit money and others take it on credit Undoubtedly if you want to lower demands you are adding risks to borrowers I too understand this because of the excessive bureaucracy of the demands that are being brought into Spain They do not cease to be a way of eliminating financial intermediation as you have explained and of favouring the saver and the borrower but you are forgetting that precisely because of your form those credit portfolios in the credit sections lack total diversification They are granted in a very specific geographical area to people who sometimes engage in the same activity sometimes if the cooperative is from a sector and you are considering people who have the same profession and are from the same geographical area so that the portfolio is very little diversified and the risk is high It is true that they enjoy that health that the commercial relations of the next that is true to see who stops paying a credit when the depositor is his neighbor In that sense I see the positive side The credit sections do not cease to be one of the best expressions of microfinance of what were the piles of piety as well which were loaded when the savings boxes were loaded In the background cooperativism reminds much of Schumacher 's work I remind you that he is an economist not a Formula 1 pilot which was entitled The little one is beautiful Schumacher is a very dear author for you on the left until you read it They often want it very much for their manifest ecologicalism and their defense of local production for local needs as the most efficient for economic life I say this because you Mr Rego in this sense have defended cooperatives but Schumacher always defended the use of coal against oil and already announced the creation of an international cartel which ended up being OPEC since production was in the hands of unsteady and bellicose countries I mean Schumacher fifty years ago was already a great advocate of energy sovereignty In any case let us conclude what you have brought here today is just an example of the excessive regulation that threatens us Of course as you refer to the five credit sections in your province you bring this problem to the House The excessive regulation is very clearly seen in two very specific sectors I say this because last week interventionism was defended Do you know what they are In the banking or credit institutions sector and in the electricity sector and with these two sectors consumers are not exactly happy What I really think is that precisely in these sectors which are so much involved which are so distasteful to consumers nothing would be understood if it were not because they are a magnificent place of employment for former politicians it should not be a coincidence Thank you very much
Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen in its recent inquiry the People 's Parliamentary Group asked the Government to comment on its position and strategy in relation to the war in Ukraine The Minister expressed strong support from the Executive for the country being attacked but works are love and not good reasons Ladies and gentlemen of the Government we have made a fool of ourselves over and over again with our aid shipments The Leopards have been loud because it has served among other things to demonstrate the disastrous state of our war reserves which is so jealously hidden That said the strategy what is said strategy does not appear in Mrs Robles answer Ladies and gentlemen of the PP you are very naive to expect such a pronouncement from the Frankenstein Government The strategy a word devalued by use and abuse has been defined as part of the dialectic of wills This will which comes from national sovereignty not NATO or the European Union is what characterizes the State as a strategic actor capable of asserting its interests before adversaries and also before partners and allies You know that the sovereignty security and prosperity of our compatriots are our interests In Spain and in Europe it is time for patriots Well how can a collective will be formed within an Executive only united by its partisan interest even personal ones How to serve the national interest when the nation itself is being denied at the same time How can we enforce our international commitments when a party of the government coalition calls the terrorist organization the alliance to which we belong Mr Santiago and Mr Pisarello were warned by our Member Mr Asarta clearly two weeks ago and I have reproached Mrs Maestro for this in the Commission more than once what they have been calling the Putin war is a widespread crisis The vital interests of the major strategic actors are committed to generating an unprecedented geopolitical economic and energy crisis and of course our own A general strategy of the Government would have to have ensured Spain 's energy supply making use of the advantage of good relations with Algeria but Mr. Álvarez or Mr. Sánchez or both of them at the helm were in charge of rolling it all out giving Western Sahara to Morocco Now our imports of Putin 's gas which is also Putin's in addition to the war have multiplied while illegal immigration is growing from Algeria and Morocco and the threat to Ceuta Melilla and the Canary Islands persists Is that strategy ladies and gentlemen of the progressive coalition But time is pressing and we must focus on the motion I am already advancing our inclination to vote in favour How can I not All its points sound good to a group that as VOX has condemned from the first moment the aggression of the Russian Federation to Ukraine However read more carefully we have felt that our compliance with points 2 3 and 6 must be nuanced so we have recorded the corresponding amendments It is proposed to include a specific item in the State General Budgets to finance the shipment of military equipment to Ukraine It seems right to us and we will vote in favour provided that it is specified that this item is not considered part of the defence effort or therefore the resources to be allocated to our Armed Forces are not considered to be part of the defence effort Point 3 calls on the Government to ensure a budget increase in defence to reach a minimum of 2 of GDP How many years ladies and gentlemen The horizon agreed in Wales ends in 2024 and the government with its agreement ladies and gentlemen of the PP has extended it until 2029 Do you really believe ladies and gentlemen of the left and right benches that the international situation and the state of prostration of our Armed Forces advise us to continue trying for luck With regard to point 6 this gives us some perplexity Ukraine 's accession to the European Union is today a desideratum paid for by the natural interest of that country 's government and by a certain flight ahead of the European Union plunged into endogenous and also external crises But ladies and gentlemen Ukraine is a war torn country in which none of our allies wish to intervene In the absence of an explicit NATO guarantee the proposal to speed up its accession to the European Union is a toast to the sun These are our amendments to those three points We will vote for them if they accept them Thank you very much
Thank you Madam President Firstly the recognition by this parliamentary group of those who work in prevention surveillance and protection services our regret to all those Spaniards in the rural world who have lost everything in these devastating fires and our condolences to the deceased There are about 300 000 hectares of calcined land including several protected areas of great ecological importance Those who came to fight for biodiversity and sustainability with their 2030 agendas and their ecological demagogy are devastating our peoples and our fields for lack of prevention by leaving and demagogy In just seven years since 2015 the People 's Party put us on the 2030 agenda fires multiply biodiversity declines rural depopulation accelerates and the profitability of the primary sector collapses The demographic winter is raging in our rural areas and the fire is burning hundreds of thousands of hectares You are climate change since you ruled with your 2030 agenda and destructive environmental legislation If all this apocalyptic weather that the Minister has raised was so predictable why have you done absolutely nothing You pose us practically the end of the world and that there is nothing to do That is the panorama that they pose us it is like the song of Sinister Total that poses us the extinction of the human race The reality is that fires go out in winter everyone knows this with a certain interest in avoiding fires The environmental legislation that you and the former have developed for years prevents you from doing preventive work because of an excess of protectionism and bureaucracy which often prevents you not only from expediting these tasks but also from carrying them out They do n't seem to be very interested in my intervention The plans for the management of natural spaces protected by the new environmentalist paradigm carried out by this Government and the People 's Party following these globalist environmentalist agendas in Brussels are hell for the prevention and management of public and private mountains We have as examples the radical eco-legislation in national parks nature parks reserves Red Natura 2000 The competent administrations have drastically and exponentially reduced investment in reforestation and forest management and this is a fact that can be seen There are public farms that have burned for example in the province of Ciudad Real whose firewalls had not been cleaned up due to bureaucratic problems in hiring management companies For example Agenda 2030 's Sustainable Development Goal 15 the life of terrestrial ecosystems challenges traditional practices associated with key sectors with extraordinary economic roots such as deforestation hunting or forest management which have been tested as effective methods for the rural environment and fire prevention The principle of human non-intervention in the natural environment whether in management conservation or exploitation has become a quasi- religious principle of progressive politicians that is being devastating in Europe 's human ecosystems The Administration is prohibiting the intervention in the natural environment of people living in the rural world forcing them to leave the countryside a field that has been managed and transformed by man for thousands of years This royal decree law has much more to do with the extinction of forest fires than with prevention to which they play a secondary role Prevention is essential The requests declarations and demonstrations of the entire technical community of our country involved in the extinction and prevention of forest fires have for decades been pointing to the large amount of forest fuel accumulated in our mountains and environmental policies imposed that do not favour forest management Of the fourteen pages that comprise this royal decree law only three and a half are those that refer to the article concerning the adoption of urgent measures in the field of forest fires The article is full of repetitions and questions that are already being carried out and that do not bring anything new and therefore are a real toast to the sun With regard to Article 1 3 we think that the amendment referring to the intercession of the State is appropriate a fact which highlights important lack of coordination between some autonomous plans for extinction rather because of political rivalries than because of strictly technical factors as it should be Let us remember that the Montes Act that was amended was developed by the People 's Party in 2003 verifying for decades the lack of coordination by the transfer of all fire skills to autonomous communities outside the Spanish State Another failure of that autonomous fundamentalism that everyone shows The article while we see it very necessary and widely demanded by the different regional extinction devices we call it unambitious and urge the Government to develop it in a regulation at the national level that definitely homogenizes at the national level what has been demanding for decades the emergency services of forest fires and the state security bodies and forces In short the royal decree law in no way solves problems but rather becomes complicated by its indefiniteness redundancy and administrative overload over existing legislation It is also a missed opportunity to address truly important issues such as specific regulation with regard to the serious problem of forest fire prevention in the urban forest interface In VOX we are clear that for our mountains our rural world and our biodiversity to continue to exist it is necessary for you to leave the government urgently and for VOX to develop your agenda which is Spain Thank you very much
With all due respect Madam President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The draft Organic Law amending the Organic Law 10/1995 of the Criminal Code on Animal Abuse is based on wrong principles which in the opinion of this parliamentary group require that it be returned to the Government from which it comes For starters the urgency procedure is unnecessary and not justified The most serious of the arguments against this bill is the animalistic spirit that informs the articulated one and that is paired with the purpose of continuing with the implementation of its globalist agenda at the anthropological level an approach that entangles to perfection with the spirit of the Law 17/2021 of amendment of the Civil Code the Mortgage Law and the Law of Civil Prosecution on the legal regime of the animals which voted in favour of all of you and to which only VOX opposed and which has a vision of nature linked to the urban world that identifies the animals with the pets Both this draft amendment to the Penal Code and the animal welfare bill discussed earlier are lethal to a rural world that has been transformed and managed by man for thousands of years based on a completely different anthropological vision from that which we want to impose with these rules What is the nihilism we are talking about It is an international movement organized and financed by billionaires of the global elite in order to impose a new moral order in the world in the relationship of man and animals so that the world is more culturally flat more homogeneous a sort of unique thought without criterion without the certainties that the tradition truth and common values provide us This parliamentary group considers animal abuse of course to be a social evil but not because animals have rights which constitutes a philosophical and legal disparate but because abuse constitutes a profoundly incisive and denigrating conduct of human moral dignity The current regulation of our Penal Code offers adequate protection to animals in order to prevent their abuse It does so by distinguishing the legal consequences of criminal action according to the type of animal because it understands that the care of domestic and wild animals must be different in attention both to the particularities of their species in relation to man and to the context in which they live No law can depart from the reality of what animals are in themselves from what they are for the human being and from the treatment that in keeping with the above man must dispense us in fact the above is the doctrine of all European comparative law This bill eliminates the distinction between domestic and wild animals and speaks only of the abuse of vertebrate animals without distinction or exception It is absolutely false that the German and British laws include without exception all vertebrate animals within the concept of animal abuse It is a shame that this falsehood is incorporated into the explanatory statement This legal text has been criticized both by the Attorney General 's Office and by the Ministry of Agriculture itself It is curious that those politicians who consistently claim principles such as the minimum intervention of criminal law orientation to reintegration the criminal as the last resort to which to resort those who call for the approximation of terrorists and who refuse to increase penalties for rapists terrorists or abusers or those who pride themselves on the decriminalization of abortion demand absolutely disproportionate penalties for all these animal related criminal types The draft organic law is a serious violation of the principle of proportionality since the penalties proposed for the crime of animal abuse are to a large extent consistent with those provided for in our Criminal Code for the crime of human injury The project introduces the use of firearms as an aggravating factor in the crime of animal abuse A clear purpose is understood in all this to end kinegetic management hunting This purpose has been expressed by the Government along with the end of the bullfighting and other cultural and sporting shows rooted in our tradition with the aim of making minimalist court arguments no matter how much the PSOE tries to disguise with stagings that do not deceive anyone at all In short we are faced with a text that manifests an obvious philosophical and legal disorientation animalist decentralized from man and disconnected from reality that summarizes globalist ideology like the rest of the laws discussed today in this Congress and that incurs obvious errors of legal technique What we want in the VOX Parliamentary Group is to decide whether we want to defend the conservation of nature and animals from the point of view of common sense or whether we want to defend that roosters rape chickens based on these absolutely schizophrenic ideologies or on these laws that they claim to dehumanize man and humanize the animal Thank you very much
Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen more than twenty days ago I warned Minister Planas at his appearance in the Commission that the food dependence of Spain and the European Union on third countries such as Russia or Ukraine currently at war on products as basic as cereals would be fatal for our food supply and could produce hunger in Europe We have insisted on the defense of national food sovereignty since we arrived at Congress and our insistence was answered from the beginning by all groups including the People 's Party insulting us calling us autarchic or anti-European We have called for the urgent removal and immediate repeal of the 2030 Agenda and any international agreement or legislation that blames our producers for environmental problems while exempting the real culprits On 9 March we asked the Minister to draw up a contingency plan and a new less green and more agricultural common agricultural policy which urgently encourages the production and strength of the agricultural sector recognizing its priority and strategic character Green demagogy or our children 's bread globalism or patriotism posture or food security Agricultural policy both national and European Union policy is inoperative As soon as it leaves producers helpless in theoretical situations of overproduction such as overnight it is intended that all kinds of food should be produced as a matter of urgency To top it off the so called crisis reserve is paid for by farmers The agricultural sector cannot react as if it were trying to open or close a key The costs are insurmountable The farmers who are ignored and caught closing their farms cannot return to the business as if they were trying to open or close a trade in the Gran Via Madrid Today we are in this motion with dozens of measures that we have complemented with our amendments We want to stress the apparent political turn of the party that is presenting it which calls even for the revision of the European Green Pact a party that has enthusiastically and without any kind of critical spirit the whole of the green architecture of the European Commission very much in line with its European People 's Political Group which is chaired by the Commission a party that drives the 2030 Agenda and renounces the productive capacity of our agriculture as it continues to do today in Brussels We agree with the vast majority of the concrete measures in your motion It 's never too late if the bliss is good We welcome the common sense here in Spain but we do not want it to happen as happened in the health crisis where transporters farmers farmers and fishermen were the heroes of the first line but as soon as the crisis has relaxed they have become by the progressive consensus ultras and intransigent simply because they cannot continue to work to lose money for the costs of production energy and fuel caused by the policies of this government They 're ultras of your children 's bread We want real and sustained commitments over time not patches a real strategy in defense of profitable and productive agriculture the only formula for sustainability and food sovereignty We want the government to urge the European Commission to curb green demagogy and to take into account the negative warnings of the scientific report drawn up by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission itself We want to use trade as a complement and projection of our agricultural sector but with the necessary trade safeguards to protect our national agricultural sector so that they do not replace us We want a national hydrological plan that takes into account that water is a good thing for all Spaniards and that is fundamental to cohering the territory of the nation with irrigation and that the European funds do not go away for chiringuitos or for irrigation of our agricultural competitors in North Africa In short apart from foreign agendas we want to bet on our agenda
Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen this rule is a regulation which aims to consolidate the common agricultural policy a common agricultural policy which we have already said in various committees which is demagogic economically reduced and ruinous a CAP which aims to achieve environmental and climate objectives through a new approach based on the European Green Pact a fanatical and eco-radical pact signed by all of you and a CAP which increases a very difficult bureaucracy already to be fulfilled by farmers and farmers which they do not understand and which has absolutely terrified them We see them constantly in the Spanish countryside and they tell us every day that it complicates their work In addition production costs continue to rise and the implementation of the farm 's objectives at the table seriously harms the entire Spanish countryside It is a good thing that this parliamentary procedure has eliminated the ban on the burning of plant remains generated in the agricultural environment A victory in the face of the senseless urbanist radical echo that does not understand agricultural uses and puts nothing but obstacles to farmers for the benefit of these global green agendas made behind the back of the people by elites who have not stepped on the field in their lives Food sovereignty has been a priority of our parliamentary group since we entered the Congress of Deputies Food sovereignty is a term that both France and Italy with their new Minister of Agriculture Francesco Lollobrigida have included within the Ministries of Agriculture which are now called the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Sovereignty Why did they do it Because like VOX you 've realized that you have to defend yours The concept of food sovereignty that we defend in our parliamentary group is to strengthen the values of our food to bet on our primary agri-food sector and to strengthen our production system in the face of economic crises or catastrophes It is a concept that does not exclude trade or trade relations but seeks in that trade our international complementarity and projection without sacrificing our productive sectors or our national security Our productive sectors are absolutely threatened by the indiscriminate entry of products from third countries that exercise unfair competition because they do not comply with the rules to which we subject our producers in environmental matters in terms of quality or in terms of labour legislation We reject the European Union 's crushing of our farmers with this green bureaucracy while watering hundreds of millions of euros to third countries in both agriculture and irrigation We have as last example of this case the concession to Morocco of 120 million euros for the modernization of agriculture announced last week by our spokesman Jorge Buxade Morocco is a country denounced by the Spanish countryside to the anti-fraud office of the Union for non-payment of customs duties fraud in labelling and lack of traceability How good it would be to our Spanish farmers that 120 million are going to Morocco Since VOX we have not only warned the Government of the reality that comes with green demagogy in relation to our agricultural production sector but have repeatedly submitted reports to it drawn up by independent bodies such as the United States Department of Agriculture and the European Commission itself which made it absolutely clear that the Green Pact is ruining us Who supports green policies All of you except VOX The spokesman for the People 's Group asked us earlier how we have come to this situation For we have come to this situation because of the implementation of the policies especially of the People 's Group the Socialist Group and the rest of the groups There are many European countries that also openly question green suicide policies and as an example we have the conclusions of the five Visegrad Group Agriculture Committees which oppose among other things the European Commission 's legislative proposal on the use of chemical plant protection products as part of the Farm to Bureau Strategy which will end up crushing our farmers and their production The flat rate reduction of 50 of plant protection chemicals as proposed by the European Commission destroys the competitiveness of our agriculture and favours the import of food products from third countries is a real madness The minister told us yesterday that we had to be responsible for meeting the sustainability and eco-schemes of this new CAP and that we have a commitment to the world What about the commitment to Spain I ask the minister to look into the eyes of farmers and farmers and tell them not to commit themselves to their land not to commit themselves to the profitability of their farms not to commit themselves to their families and to commit themselves to the objectives of elites who have not chosen anyone at all and whose dark interests only benefit them Those who are irresponsible are all of you ruining a fundamental sector that puts food at the table of the Spaniards that takes care of our fields and that is having a very bad time because of your political decisions VOX rejects this consolidation of the CAP agreement through the strategic plan and calls for a substantial revision of the CAP because it is detrimental to the interests of the agricultural sector Faced with a rachitic and ruined Europe to which the globalist bureaucrats of salon and heel settled in Brussels and Strasbourg VOX wants a strong and competitive European agrarian space that faces global geopolitical and food crises and builds more sovereign and free European nations in the face of threats
"Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen as we said in the previous debate this rule is a failure of the legislator and not even the triumph of the partyocracy It is the flagrant abuse of a Government and specifically of the Ministry of Finance which orders the parties that support it to serve their interests to plunder if it is more up to the middle self governing and entrepreneurial classes in a wasteful State that prevents any new opportunity for those who acting properly and in good faith have failed in their professional or entrepreneurial endeavour especially the self governing We also said that all this has prevented a paused conscientious and responsible analysis and debate of key competition legislation on competitiveness in our economy The processing of this rule with 607 amendments in Congress and 252 in the Senate has been carried out at a record time whose work in the Paper was limited to one day and a few weeks later is already debated by the Senate with four amendments that we are dealing with today With regard to the amendments which have already been voted on before speaking Mr Bal with which the conviction is relative one of them is contradictory according to the very reasoned message accompanying the opinion the one referred to in Article 37c of the Law in relation to the competitions and more specifically the appointment of the competition manager who becomes a competitive mediator which is not the meaning of the law but which in the opinion itself invokes the possible contradiction another remains half hearted but has its meaning to slightly limit the harmful and abusive privileges of public credit in Article 690 of the Law a third only formal one affecting Article 704 of the Consolidated Text and the fourth logical third transitional in drawing up the regulation in the competitions administration Having said that we are faced with one of the rules that has undergone the most changes throughout history and with the text that will come out of this House today it will continue to change because it is engaged in its early interpretation under article 1.6 of the Civil Code taking into account the complementary nature of the case law and which we fear will soon be It is a rule that was amended by Royal Decree 1/2020 of 5 May which approved the consolidated text a consolidated text that was not such and denied the exemption from public credit and since it was a legislative decree there was a legal gap due to the over limitation in its harmonization which forced the application of the ultra vires principle a legal principle that considers null and void acts that exceed the limit of the law and that legislative decree did so As a rule in this Government I ignored as such a rule the doctrine of the Supreme Court and in particular the treatment of the exemption from public credit in the procedure of the second opportunity on which I will focus I 'll try to explain it as for laymen in the matter but I 'm sure they 'll understand me When a company goes badly a trading company goes to the competition procedure it is dealt with agreements or agreements are attempted and if this is not possible it is settled and with the liquidation the company dies it is terminated and settled in the Commercial Register and if no liability has been derived to the administrators since their action has been diligent the burial of the legal person with all the debts including the public credit is formalized by the closure of the corresponding sheet sheet volume and book in the commercial register and ceases to exist without more than the legal person Well to individual entrepreneurs self employed and natural persons who under the same conditions are subject to commercial and competitive legislation the liquidation obviously does not end the actual death of the natural person good but at the same time we will see in fact it is civil death with outstanding debts that persist and they are forced to act outside the system through testaferros and in the submerged economy The only possibility is to give such persons a second chance and thus exemption by agreement or by liquidation if the requirements of any credit including public credit are met Not here not in Spain Minister in clear contradiction to what is suggested and proposed by Directive 2017 1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council Let the Spaniards know all those who can affect what we are discussing today that with the new text that is adopted less public credit can be exonerated than with the rule that currently governs the treatment of the known second chance procedure Courts and hearings specifically I would like to highlight that of Barcelona following the consolidated text and applying the ultra vires principle continued to exempt under the Supreme Court 's criterion 50 of public credit and the other 50 went to a payment plan which if it did not come to pass but it was shown that the debtor had used the humanely possible resources it ended up exonerating If someone had a debt for example EUR 80 000 40,000 will be exonerated directly and the rest by agreement with the said exception For now it is only possible to exempt a maximum of EUR 10,000 so it will continue to owe EUR 70,000 that cannot be paid as the debtor will immediately switch to the submerged economy or act by way of testaferros This is what there is nothing more or less is legal practice and those of us who have dedicated ourselves to this we know Moreover by mor of the first transitory in those procedures already initiated and informed to our customers the clients in general of all the legal advisers of that practice from now on the rules of play are changed they will not be able to exonerate and they are also being prevented from starting again on that second opportunity and this is an attack minister on the principle of irretroactivity of the laws In short we understand that this Government is only thinking of collecting if not it would not be so afraid of exonerating public credit and of plundering not protecting and supporting entrepreneurs and self employed people on a second chance those who did all right who tried everything and went wrong It 's been a missed opportunity This law unfortunately is not written on lasting stone It is an ephemeral creation that does not reach even the eternal fleetingness of a star in summer Thank you very much Madam President"
"Mr. President thank you very much Ladies and gentlemen a missed opportunity I would like to thank the other rapporteurs less Mr Aranda for the treatment we have had in the discussion at a single presentation meeting of a 2019 directive amending another 2017 directive namely 1132 Thus on the 23rd day in the Committee on Justice a law was passed in two days containing six hundred and seven amendments and involving more than two hundred legislative reforms An absolute failure as legislators They have prevented a debate as has been said from paused a calm and conscientious debate on a law that affects us all that affects the citizen that affects SMEs and that affects the self employed that ultimately affects the economy of this country in a tangential way It has four large blocks which I believe are important restructuring plans the second chance the special procedure and the competition administration basically As far as restructuring plans are concerned the figure of the restructuring expert is introduced which will see what the rating is at the end and whether or not it works As for the second chance I 'm coming in now As regards the special procedure which was not the subject of European transposition the scope of application is reduced in relation to the liabilities of the undertakings concerned the percentage of public credit is increased to bring the debtor into liquidation and the application for attorney and attorney is imposed And as far as the competition administration is concerned certainly and here we have some representatives this figure is clearly demonized in this law something has been harmonized or reassured but not sufficiently As for the second chance yesterday the providence made him receive this car in the office This is a car of benefit of exemption from the dissatisfied liability a car in which a customer is exempt and I have to say because I promised for an amount of EUR 1 064 000 Do you know when the procedure that led to this EUR 1 064 000 benefit exempt order began which is no longer a benefit and will now be called a benefit exempt order I started it in October 2015 when we had the royal decree that the People 's Party made that way a week before the debate on the state of the nation that Royal Decree 1/2015 which later became Law 25/2015 second chance There it was not possible to legislate well because it was not granted article 1911 of the Civil Code was feared Fortunately in several judgements not only from Catalonia but also from Mallorca and other jurisdictions in Supreme Court judgements of 13 March 2019 and 2 July 2019 the exemption of public claims was achieved With this we find here a very strange situation which links with the amendment and they do not withdraw it 266 of Squerra Republicana in which the transitional first talks about continuing the procedure of consecutive competitions through the old legislation What 's the meaning of this The meaning is that with the new law you will be able to exonerate less public credit than with the previous one because on the basis of the principle ultra vires which Mr Bal and the lawyers who are here know very well you cannot accept the reform that extralimits the law ultra vires as did the consolidated text that banned the exemption from public credit The Supreme Court in the words of Sancho Gargallo himself made it very clear the exemption from public credit is still applicable For the time being a calculation has been made on very specific quantities With all the calculations that I have through the derivation of the liability of the natural person who already know how the Tax Agency shoots simply by the relation of the Competition Law in article 5 of article 367 I can assure you that cases of derivation of the liability of the natural person for 150,000 euros or 100,000 euros are being kicked and the Tax Agency is willing to continue to exist This exemption from public credit does not serve us it does not serve the second chance at all and it is crushing the self employed And above all we ask that the transitory first be maintained not because they are Catalans or because this happens mainly in Catalonia because in other hearings it is also happening Thank you very much"
They are presenting to this House demands on the security of the outer areas of the nuclear power plants in Tarragona They request the transposition of Directive 2014 87 Euratom but it was already transposed in 2018 exactly by Royal Decree 1402/2018 of 23 November I was n't going to say it but since you asked for it and I know the facts I 'm telling you And it only affects external security in the appropriate coordination with internal security What remains to be transposed is Directive 2013 59 Euratom and the Nuclear Security Council and the Ministry of the Interior are working to transpose it As for the modification of the planning areas they request these are one of the basic concepts associated with the radiological criteria in the plans being the Nuclear Security Council the only agency competent for definition and development based on its creation law without prejudice to the necessary coordination with the Ministry of the Interior in those aspects of civil protection logistics communications etc We have long and long spoken in the nuclear paper about the necessary independence of the regulator with the unanimous practice of parliamentarians He comes to talk about nuclear safety for people We all value it it 's very important it sounds very good and they think we have to support it VOX of course is in favour of as much safety as possible in all matters relating to power stations and therefore we believe that the exclusive competence of the Nuclear Security Council is very good Nuclear risk management is the exclusive competence of the State at all its stages in the face of a type of risk with an undoubted national nature it may even be international and in which it is preferable for response mechanisms to have a single command For once and without precedent we agree with the Minister of the Interior In addition you ask for it with that lament of secular abandonment that reminds us so much of Spain steals us that you no longer believe yourselves He told us about roads without asphalting the last time forgetting that they are the government in Catalonia and that they have been able to impose on the Spanish government the pardon of the coupts of 27 October 2017 the elimination of the crime of sedition of the Criminal Code and the reduction of the sentence of embezzlement VOX will work tirelessly to stop Sanchez 's blow In the field of energy Catalonia presents a great distinction with respect to the rest of Spain The vast majority of all electricity generated in Catalonia is of nuclear origin 58 more than half They 'd already like a percentage of that indepes In all of Spain only 21 are of nuclear origin Does it sound like you 've heard VOX talk about energy sovereignty They influence the government but this time for good and make it extend the life of the power plants or they will leave them in the dark They require a couple of small modular reactor projects for Catalonia to put them at the spearhead of modernity Do you want more nuclear safety Straighten up the seventh waste plan and have it build the ATC The difference in security between the ATIs we have now which are provisional and a centralized storage is multiplying security by four If they continue to support the Government as they have so far they will end up with closed and demolished power stations and lonely expanses full of rusty cans in the open waiting for politicians to agree to build deep geological storage Then it will be too late for Spain and therefore for Catalonia We 'll have lost another train of real progress On the improvement of infrastructures and the improvement of the mobile telephone network nothing to object to but we also ask for the rest of Spain Thank you very much
Thank you Mr. President Mr Garzón another debate on budgets Enjoy it yourself because thank God this is definitely going to be the last one you 're going to live in where you are You know we 've been saying for a long time that you 're the minister of nothingness because ever since you were put in this government with a shoemaker you and the little boy with practically no skills that he runs we were clear that it was n't going to do any good Because look at that engineer at that little ministry that he 's been set up to have him parked there I do n't know whose idea it was they named him the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and it's also bad luck that right now it 's going to be consumption one of the reasons they 're going to end up with this government Because to you as a good communist elite who is I know that the problems of the middle class of the working class affect little but I will try to outline in a few seconds the horror film that many consumers in this country are living because they will surely have to choose this winter between being able to eat or being able to turn on the heating Look the price of gas has risen by 341 this year and according to the International Energy Agency it is possible that what remains of winter can even be doubled The electricity bill has risen almost twice as much in the year 2022 as in the rest of the European Union and we are paying right now one of the most expensive electricity prices in the countries in our environment The CPI of the shopping basket and I 'm not talking about luxury products has already risen by an average of 15 this year the largest increase in the last thirty four years and which will entail an additional cost of about 850 euros for each family And in the face of this disaster Minister what have you done as Minister of Consumer Affairs this year For he has launched a campaign to teach the Spaniards to keep the eggs in the fridge and has advised us without any scientific criteria that we only consume four a week he has called the parents to a toy strike to fight against sexist advertising he has recommended using second hand clothes let us not change the mobile to save the planet he has promoted sharing appliances with the neighbors to pollute less and he has even dared to tell us that those who criticized his campaign against meat what we had was a testosterone problem Mr Garzón in this cabinet of ministers created with altars by the autocrat you have usually won the title of inept major of the Government of Spain and look at that there were candidates And it is that really it has become a classic in a classic even in bars waiting for you to open your mouth to see which sector or which collective sinks And since you hold this honorary title of Minister of Consumer Affairs without a portfolio you could have expected at least that you would have made some gesture some initiative to hear some dissenting voice in the Council of Ministers something to earn the salary and that it would serve as a consolation to alleviate the drama of so many Spanish consumers and families but the truth is that you are here for what is and is worth which is basically like other ministries to spend on absurdities the money of all Spanish people by the way this year with these budgets of ruin 12 more than last year about 7 million more euros But you know what Do you know anything curious Do you want me to tell you where that 80 more is going to stop those 7 million euros more than you will have Mr Garzón and your entourage in the 2023 financial year Well yeah let 's think it over and you 'll be right That 80 per cent more budget is going to go to staff costs Of course at staff costs because the chollo is over and you have to place most of your friends that the desert crossing is going to be very long Mr Garzón the only thing you and your ministry have achieved during this parliamentary term has been to become a spurt of the worst of politics and a joke of very bad taste for most Spaniards a joke that by the way has come very dear to us during these years And with his incompetence his fanaticism and above all his verbal incontinence he has had the ability to put on a war footing each and every one of the basic pillars of our economy agriculture livestock industry trade tourism Mr. Garzón you have n't let yourself be a puppet I 'm telling you Because Socialists to see if you know once and for all that this is what is happening this is the clear example of what is happening when once again we put personal interests partisan interests before the interests of the Spaniards and in this case in your particular case Mr Garzón as unfortunately in so many others that we have had to witness during the debate we are having these days we see with amazement that it is the price of toll of quota to agree at any price Thus we invent a little chiringuite and put in front of a radical incompetent and eager for protagonism But do n't worry that as I 've already mentioned on some occasion in the end everything passes bill and this is a reason to add to a long list for which the Spaniards are going to send you and your partners all your partners directly to your home That is so as soon as you have enough decency to give them the floor to let them decide and convene elections that will allow us to start building everything that you have destroyed during these years Thank you very much
Mrs. Joy I do n't presume to know I 'm socratic I just know I do n't know anything The problem is that you ignore until that that you do n't know anything Look again and again he accuses us of not making proposals and my colleague Georgina and I have made hundreds of proposals in the Education Committee They are all rejected because apparently they come from the far right Time and time again they 're rejected For example we have proposed that a single State selectivity be made which you do not want because you do not want to harm the relationship you have with the separatists We 've made hundreds of proposals and they do n't admit any Then you come here and say that we do not propose of course we propose For example we propose that you comply with the Constitution that you comply with article 20.1 c of the Constitution establishing freedom of tenure And chair freedom has a double meaning according to the Constitutional Court 's ruling of May 1981 and the Supreme Court 's ruling of December 2005 Firstly the freedom of a professor says that the teacher has the right in disciplines of a dialectic nature to take the view he considers most appropriate to his loyal knowledge That is the positive point of view And the negative is that the teacher has the right to refuse to be a belt of transmission of an official doctrine You seek to impose the law of historical memory as an official doctrine and to accuse anyone who steps out of the path you mark of hate crime You do not presume to be a Democrat because this has nothing democratic And as for you being the greatest exponent here of what the Spanish people apparently want I 'm going to show you a small chart so you can see how the polls are The Spanish people are beginning to turn their backs on them now and I assure you that when we have powers of government we will change teaching and for good You have been indoctrining or trying to indoctrinate not teachers teachers conform to the agendas and according to your ideology We are not going to impose any kind of indoctrination You 're talking about the parental pin Look the parental pin was invented by the UCD When the official ideology of that time was Catholic religion and morals the UCD invented parental pin giving parents the opportunity to choose another indoctrination Which you do n't do which forces everyone to go through the stone of gender ideology LGTBI laws historical memory etc So do n't tell me stories I already know them all because I 've been teaching for many years Do n't tell me stories Minister Parental pin is a right of parents recognized in paragraph 27.3 of the Constitution That is why we take LOMLOU to the Constitutional because it violates constitutional requirements which you have already done at least three times so we know about our complaints to the Constitutional Court You tell us about the Agenda Spain The Agenda Spain is a very general document Whenever you want I will explain to you what our educational project is and what we intend to do with education And I repeat it for the umpteenth time What we are trying to do is to put all Spaniards on an equal footing that there should be no evidence of selectivity that everyone should study the same that there should be no different curricula depending on where one is born or that there should be no different curricula depending on whether one is studying in the public in concert or in the private To study the same in Andalusia as in Catalonia And by the way left wing gentlemen who end the betrayal that you are committing in Catalonia against the most disadvantaged classes which are those who have Spanish as their usual language and are adding to it a difficulty because you are forcing them to immersion in Catalan Here everything is presented as very beautiful and apparently this is for them to learn two languages so that they are bilingual No that 's not true This is to make a non-existent homeland based on ethnolinguistic criteria And you 're consenting So please do n't lecture me and insult me by saying that I presume to know a knowledge I do n't have Philosophy means that one seeks knowledge and if one seeks it it is precisely because one does not have it You as Santiago Abascal said this morning are not a philosopher you are a sophist because you have a knowledge or you think you have a knowledge that is useless and you even ignore it
Mr. President ladies and gentlemen good morning We are here today to discuss the amendment to the whole of the Citizens Parliamentary Group 's bill on urgent prevention and containment measures to address the health crisis caused by COVID 19 As we discussed on 1 February blackmail seemed to us to be the real decree law and its validation and blackmail in substance and in form seems to us today to be the debate of this amendment to the whole presented by the Citizens Group To talk about health restrictions and masks do they force us to treat pensions again If they had proposed deleting this point which should be incorporated by its importance in another initiative and not in the health framework of preventive measures against COVID we could start talking We say no to blackmail but we do not say no to pensioners on the contrary we must again oppose their debate now since it is absolutely inappropriate and a practice too common and repeated in this Government to mix matters that have nothing to do with each other to force us to vote for the whole thing on the side I repeat it again as a few weeks ago Ortega Lara 's party does not allow blackmail With regard to the amendment of Law 2/2021 the removal of the restrictions imposed by the Government was shared but it was constitutionally unacceptable for Citizens to transfer to the Congress of Deputies the competence of the declaration of the end of the crisis generated by COVID 19 It is the responsibility of the Government which already abdicated transferring its responsibility to the autonomous communities I take this opportunity to give our opinion on how we should reintegrate into normality The Government should at this time only issue recommendations and not impose any more obligations or of course additional restrictions since the scientific evidence the flow of this last wave and the management of the countries in our environment have already highlighted that they serve no purpose I repeat they can recommend it but they must not force it The restrictive measures imposed have led to the destruction of a multitude of people and small businesses who have also been unable to access the aid announced by the Executive in the form of drums and plates because in daily practice the bureaucracy has prevented them from accessing them The ineffectiveness of prohibitions and the high level of injury to citizens in general and to workers in particular have already been demonstrated To the catastrophe of the Chinese plague is added the Russian war and the inefficiency of the 'sanchocommunist government which is a constant If we analyze this last wave in which we are still sailing we can see that although the severity has decreased with vaccination the number of infected has been so high that although the percentage of serious patients over the total number has decreased in absolute numbers the special services of the hospitals have again collapsed Let 's not be fooled we 're still in trouble Obligatory masks inside outside and interpersonal distance do not seem to have the effectiveness that should be with regard to the containment of the disease For this reason many countries in our environment are beginning to dispense with them for either we die of COVID or we die of hunger aided by the measures imposed by this Government Given that the pandemic situation has no near end and that we already have experience of what the measures taken so far have given us it may be time to change course and choose to equip citizens with knowledge so that everyone can protect their health and economy by making their decisions freely In short in VOX we advocate for the truthful information to the Spaniards without any limitation We must be treated as responsible adults We need to educate ourselves in healthy lifestyles and we need to be trained to avoid infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID flu tuberculosis pneumonia and those that come Thirdly and with regard to retired healthcare professionals we reiterate here our concern that the increase in their income has a negative impact on their taxation They must consider that their extra wage is taxed at the minimum rate in order to make up for them and not to be taxed with which the Government would be benefiting in addition to its work from its income Ultimately and with regard to the recruitment of foreign health care workers it should be noted that the completion of this sixth wave makes it less urgent to rush into the recruitment of professionals and what we should do is to speed up the approval process especially in the case of Ukrainian health care workers These professionals must have the same responsibilities as regular workers without requiring supervision by their peers If this were not the case comparative grievances could arise in terms of remuneration and functions and all this could lead to job tensions for the optional staff Think if doctors no longer have time to properly care for patients there is even less time for the care or supervision of the work of other colleagues and the same happens in other professional categories In short while we share the vision of removing the restrictions and prohibitions imposed by the Government which can and must now establish properly informed recommendations we will vote against this amendment because the Citizens Parliamentary Group has not had the courage to propose the withdrawal of pensions in its quest for survival approaching the dynamics of the Government Thank you very much Mr Vice President Thank you For the People 's Parliamentary Group in Congress I have the floor Mrs Pastor
Thank you very much President Good morning This bill on animals is one of the greatest ideological nonsense discussed in this House Humanizing the animal and animalizing the man pretending to grant rights to the animals is an absolute desatino liquidating the natural position of man and subjecting him to the global Marxism to which you are kneeling which paint beautiful with a reddish colour and make him call Agenda 2030 Giving rights to animals is an irrationality in the category of pretending that the sun is the moon and the moon is the sun The law since man is man serves to regulate human relations and those of these with the world and animals by their very nature do not fit in the condition of men A living being who has no natural capacity to acquire commitment or obligation cannot by its own existential reality acquire rights comparable to persons His ideological sectarianism is absolutely fallacious This government is at the service of the economic interests of the globalist progressive consensus elites to whom animals care little or nothing You are mere servants at your service and it is such servileness that you dare with the folly of giving false rights to those who cannot acquire obligations And they cannot because they lack will because they lack the capacity to decide They lack responsibility because they are not aware of their actions lack the power to know and recognize that they have rights and finally lack the power to demand the fulfilment of their rights VOX not only rejects this text in its entirety because it intends to grant a Pharisee rights to animals but also because it establishes a system of obligations restrictions prohibitions and sanctions that pose a serious danger to the whole social economic and cultural sector with which we live with which we are with which we have sat and listened Everyone who really loves the animal begs us please to get them out of this fanatical norm that no one wants to be in With this law they condemn to death quickly and without social consensus hence their treatment as a matter of urgency the most representative sector of our being the sector from which we all come the rural world A few days ago Mrs. Belarus dared to say that the children belong to no one Similar obstinacy has already implemented it in this norm with pets The Project does not speak at any time of ownership of the animal it constantly speaks of adoption foster care or protection Dona Ione anyone who professes a minimum of love for their animals feels them as their own the seven members of their family but you do not understand the two most important things in life love and family They talk about animal welfare and take away all dogs and cats the meaning of their existence reproduction Are you going to sterilize them from your earliest age Do you really think that depriving them of their being is giving them a right Will they ban a bitch from getting pregnant and fine her owners with 50 000 euros for consenting to it or not making a remedy and yet we allow a 15 year old girl to kill the embryo of a life that as it is not hers gives her burial This is a genuine communist hypocrisy They have passed a law of free mortality for the elderly who are older or for the unlucky sick who have been tired of caring however they prohibit the euthanasia of an animal for old age illness or injury with possibility of treatment or palliative care article 27 paragraph a of their body of law Taking a course to have a pet is a trial to deprive us of the freedom to have children and another contradiction of this extravagant bill Depriving an elderly woman of the only thing that makes her company depriving her best friend of a pastor who is alone on the mountain ending the company of many people for not being able to study or devote time to her sectarian course is another of her contradictions In March in Madrid there were more than half a million people making them see that the more than ten million people in the countryside and mainly hunting who today accompany us in this rostrum do not want a law that is an attack on their entire flotation line They intend to make us believe that this rule does not affect hunting but as always they lie The law prohibits savagery and condemns hunting dogs ferrets and mackerel articles 25 39 and 40 This is gentlemen of the PSOE and Podemos an uncovered ban on kinegetic activity Their ignorance and ignorance of the rural world make them not aware that a hunting dog can get away from its owner and wrest a duel with a wild animal with this rule they will label it as abandoned or abused animal and they will remove it with the consequent penalty for serious infringement The PSOE sells that hunting dogs stay out of this law another counterfeit typical of remedial socialists Do you really believe that hunters do not know that the amendment tabled is an electoral measure aimed at not losing the rural vote Socialists if there 's any word left for them please comply with this plan and do n't get carried away by the communist fanaticism of those who put underwear on dogs and put cats to bed in baby cots Scientists rural dwellers circus and pet people associations brought together by nature and animals and people of the city who love animals know that there is nothing more natural and exceptional than to respect animals and let them preserve their dignity as animals Thank you very much
Ladies and gentlemen of the United Parliamentary Group We can all they tell us is a fallacy because they care very little about animals their welfare and their conservation As I have already said you are only interested in your ideological sectarianism in being at the service of those who lead you and in the progressive consensus that has invented the new religion of mascotism and animalism as a dogma of faith to generate commercial interests that ultimately have an impact on the dignity of animals What they have told us in a zalamera way is but a unique strategy and exclusively for their own interests that consists in ruining the countryside its people and its animals This law is a faithful reflection of the Machiavellian infrastructure of placement of friends that began with a Ministry of Social Affairs and Communist Agenda and another of Equality which continued with a poorly called General Directorate of Animal Rights and which now intends to create structures as one of its former leaders yes Mr Errejón was already advancing us in 2018 and I quote textually when we lose elections we must leave seeded popular institutions that resist and where to take refuge when governing the adversary There is a need for an autonomous economic infrastructure that will allow for example a large part of the militant cadres that are now engaged in institutional work In this bill they have not created one or two garitos for their militancy but have allowed the luxury of creating more than ten models of placement agencies the State Council for Animal Protection the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Protection and Rights of Animals the central system of registers for animal protection the registration of entities for animal protection type RAC RAT RAS GCOF and DEF the professional register of animal behaviour the registration of pet zoos or the registration of pet breeders Is it true that with all this conglomerate of entities they claim that the Spaniards believe that you are interested in animals The only thing that interests them is the economic amount they generate Do you think you 're going to believe that cutting the testicles or amputating the ovaries to a dog or a dog is for your animal welfare and yet amputating the ears or the ass is abused when done for strictly sanitary reasons Do you consider that the Spaniards are going to believe that this is a law against abandonment when the director general of the bad management of animals this week has confirmed that there is no official data on abandonment in Spain Do you really believe that the ban on raising animals by private individuals is for animal welfare or is it that the breeding is only going to be able to make entities that you control Do you think Spain is going to believe that the ban on the sale of animals in specialised stores is for animal welfare and not for its economic interest Do they really want us to believe that hunting dogs will be unprotected if they remain outside the law when the Penal Code itself already punishes the ill treatment of pets with fines prison sentences and years of disqualification Do you really think that the rural world believes that including hunting dogs in this law is for animal welfare or are you really going to believe that this is an uncovered ban on hunting Since when does a mascot law de facto prohibit traditional sports modalities such as wildlife or pichon shooting Since when does a mascot law intend to limit an activity such as cetera declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO Ladies and gentlemen stop fooling us After seeing in article 27 of your bill the such nonsense of saying that the procedure of assisted death of an animal must be with methods that guarantee your humanitarian condition you can expect anything I do n't know if they want to laugh at us or if really they 're capable of believing their own lies The amendment to the Criminal Code ladies and gentlemen is another of the follies that this Government has tried to bring us on 1 August through the urgent procedure in a completely unjustified and unnecessary way They know that the current regulations in our Penal Code already offer adequate protection to animals in order to avoid their abuse Article 337 of the Penal Code assumed that Spanish legislation was one of the most protected in this area Gentlemen of the government are you going to have a person in prison who kills a chicken in his house to eat it Is anyone going to jail to kill a rat who 's sneaked into his house Are you going to condemn for animal abuse someone who runs over a bird or any other wild animal According to their bill these people are going to jail The project by extending the definition of animal abuse to all vertebrate animals poses a serious threat to hunting fishing and a range of activities in the rural world I have said this with the law on animals and I repeat this with the amendment of the Penal Code it is a ban on open ended hunting a real ruin for those who dedicate themselves to animals and a condemnation of the extinction of the rural world Thank you very much
The sector hit by this crisis needs extraordinary support for its recovery They need the support they promised with European funds available which they do not implement from which they have excluded SMEs and now want to hide with new promises They wo n't make us complicit in their mismanagement Ladies and gentlemen Merry Christmas and thank you very much
Thank you President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Russia 's invasion of Ukraine has highlighted and accelerated the decision of some border countries with the Russian Federation to apply for membership of the Atlantic Alliance This is the case in Sweden and Finland countries traditionally neutral but which in view of Putin 's threat to sovereignty and territorial integrity have decided to join the aforementioned defensive organisation Yes Mr. Rego defensive and not belligerent as you said last Tuesday I would remind you that according to the founding treaty any European State that is in a position to promote the development of the principles of the treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area can join NATO in short there are no vetoes in NATO Mr Pisarello look at the obsolete NATO military structure that was originally twelve countries and we will soon be thirty two many of them world renowned for their economic and social development as well as for their democratic level and we continue to grow Mr Pisarello According to the procedure we are at the moment when the current thirty members unanimously send the invitation letter to Sweden and Finland to start negotiations Of course we will be happy to admit them to the alliance as both countries meet the conditions and decide freely to belong to the organization Since its foundation NATO has proved to be a defensive and dissuasive tool Mr Iñarritu defensive and dissuasive necessary and decisive not only during the Cold War period but throughout the later period and even today Wide sectors of the left and above all the extreme Spanish left continue with their obsolete caspian and rancio speech this time Mr Pisarello rancio of the pacifist idealism of the rejection of weapons moving more in ideological arguments than in the real and pragmatic field of the strategic interests and security and defense of Spain Felipe González was aware of the importance of belonging to NATO when in 1986 he took a turn in his policy towards the alliance asking for the yes in the referendum on this instead of the electoral slogan of NATO of entry no Do you remember Some of us who are already old yes The referendum was in favour of our entry and necessary for entry into the European Economic Community today the European Union thus admitting that the initial rejection of the PSOE had been a mistake As you can see sometimes when it is rectified it is correct This shift to the left in Spanish foreign policy in relation to the alliance was controversial and controversial for Spanish society which was debated between the pacifist idealism of the rejection of arms and the important fear of being excluded from the group of more developed countries influential and powerful in the world arguments these last ones used by President González himself to request the yes in the referendum cited as advantages for the interests of Spain The debate continues today by the extreme left and other separatist groups as we have seen that with their slogans of NATO no bases out it seems as if they do not realize what is happening in the heart of Europe and that that could happen to us to any other European country Now more than ever we would have to apply the fact that union is a force and therefore the more we are the more difficult it will be to invade one Member State by another invader and aggressor as has been the case Ladies and gentlemen days before the Madrid Summit Mr De Santiago who is here former Secretary of State and Secretary General of the Communist Party of Spain made a public statement together with other members of the Executive against NATO This is the last of a series of actions that Unidad Podemos has been carrying out against one of the bulwarks and cornerstones of Spain 's security scheme These manifestations of a prominent member of the partner party of the current Spanish Government have their consequences on foreign policy and in the VOX Parliamentary Group we express our absolute rejection of the erratic foreign policy of the Government It would be good if at least in State policies they agreed otherwise they would continue to be ridiculous and causing damage to Spain 's image abroad However and despite showing our infinite distance to this government of which you are a part the United We Can we unlike you do believe in the unity of Spain and its policies of state in this case the one relating to national security because we consider that the national interest is above any partisan struggle That you the Communists catalogue the Atlantic Alliance as a terrorist organization Mr Garzón Minister of Consumer Affairs and other Members of Parliament have expressed it in this Congress during this parliamentary term at least it wants bold and offensive no longer for the declaration itself that it is but because you are defenders of a totalitarian anti-democratic and genocidal ideology which carries millions of innocent deaths behind your back As good communists you know no loyalty beyond your party Therefore I cannot ask you for it from institutions that you reject but I do appeal to the Government of Spain to put order and coherence within its ranks because the damage caused by these demonstrations is enormous With the current mix of socialists communists and separatists who make up the worst government directly or indirectly at the worst possible time it will be complicated but we do not want to lose hope Membership of NATO represents many advantages for its members and for this reason it is increasingly the European countries and some members of the former Soviet Union who earnestly wish to join the alliance but it also represents a series of commitments that must be fulfilled As you well know the main advantage and it is also a fundamental commitment is in article 5 of the treaty whereby member countries undertake to respond militarily to an attack on one of their members And among the commitments in addition to the above members undertake to participate as far as possible in the common budget which after the war in Ukraine as you know has increased and which the Government of Spain at the last Summit in Madrid has already committed itself to gradually rising to 2 of GDP We will see that and we will also see who is responsible for doing so because it seems that the current government has the days counted until the next elections
In short ladies and gentlemen from the point of view of VOX the vote on the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO will be favourable Thank you very much
Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen Mrs Muñoz Vidal you are presenting today an initiative that sounds very good in principle a tax deduction precisely for an issue of first necessity such as the payment of the mortgage on habitual housing but I am very surprised at the implementation of your initiative which I understand is not typical of the nature of such initiatives You say that it has to be at least 25 a ceiling of EUR 400 a temporary scope and also an extraordinary character referring to the mortgages subscribed until 1 August I have been reviewing last week 's urgent inquiry the statement of the motion and I have also waited for your intervention today because I hoped that you would in some way explain something about the data on which it has been based for those levels of achievement I mean why are you talking about a ceiling of 400 euros Why not 500 or 300 Why at least 25 of the tax deduction Why not more Why not less And above all it should assess the fiscal scope of this measure How many people are you going to get to How many people can benefit It is an elementary thing that should have been accompanied by a concrete measure in those terms Another thing he has forgotten is to say the impact that this measure would have on the state 's revenues because in order to position ourselves we will have to value the benefit that this tax deduction would bring and how many Spaniards it would reach but we also need to know how it will impact the public accounts and what things are not going to be able to be paid for that income reduction in the public accounts It seems that the liberals on this occasion did not want to throw themselves into the pool or say what will happen to the measure they propose In this they look a bit like the People 's Party which talks a lot about tax cuts but does n't talk about where they 're going to cut spending so that that tax cuts are possible and do n't help increase the public deficit Because these left wing gentlemen have been increasing and increasing the public deficit to levels that are absolutely unsustainable that are tearing down future generations and precisely in a scenario in which the European Central Bank has said that it ends with the programme of incentives for the mass purchase of public debt In that scenario not to mention the counterpart that has to have any reduction in the income of the State is reckless and makes its measure become if I may say so an absolutely populist measure They have left us alone again as in so many other important things because we are the only political party in this Chamber that talks about tax cuts but puts the counterpart saying where public spending is going to be cut Precisely the left always justifies the increase of taxes by the welfare state today it has been said here by several of those who have preceded me in the rostrum of speakers that we must continue to raise taxes under the pretext of the welfare state but it is only their welfare state of which they sit here the state of political welfare and of their chiringuitos There is a lot of co-responsibility in this serious situation and I am referring to the People 's Party I do n't know if this is going to make a second Rajoy failing his promises or get us into an increase in public spending I think we must speak sincerely to the citizens because they deserve it We must be realistic and even if we are left alone by the fifty two Members of VOX we are not concerned because in Spain as in Europe it is the time of the patriots Thank you very much
"RIVOLTA L SP PSd Az Madam President on the report to Parliament by the President of the Council of Ministers and the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance pursuant to Article 6 the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will vote in favour of the debt claim for a total amount of 14.3 billion for 2022 Most of these resources derive from the increased VAT revenue resulting from the dynamics of imported energy prices and the rise in inflation which is about to exceed as estimated by the International Monetary Fund 6 We are deeply concerned about the fate of Italian citizens our communities their present and their near future More resources must be unlocked without delay to support individuals families and businesses in order to counter the effects of inflation the increase in energy products and the effects of drought and to prevent the country from falling into recession Those who have been careful have heard that practically every Group has repeated the same things the arguments and priorities are the same for everyone It is necessary to reduce the tax burden on labour the real burden that cripples business growth and rising wages therefore cutting the tax wedge is essential There is also a great need for extraordinary fiscal peace a pact with taxpayers that allows the State to recover resources that are otherwise impossible to collect to be allocated to measures to support the income of individuals families municipalities and regions In a few days by 8 August more than 500,000 taxpayers will have to pay all the installments of the break up b for 2021 in order not to lapse from the facilitated definition instead the installments relating to 2022 will have to be paid within four months by 5 December We believe that immediate action is needed through a review of the installment plans so that everyone is in a position not to succumb Just look at the numbers of house sales and auction halls they are a very worrying index which describes very well the dramatic effects on the lives of normal people Another priority is to continue to take action on the transfer of the building tax credit Strong action is needed on energy prices and to counter the effects of drought It is also important to act to support the purchasing power of households and it is essential to zero VAT rates on basic necessities The timing is tight the sharing of the stringed resolution made by all the Groups beyond the necessary distinction on the priorities of each individual Group is the best response of the Senate to the emergencies of the country and to the needs of the population families small medium and large enterprises local authorities who are in a desperate situation in the formation of budgets and of the Regions especially for health for what will be the development of the pandemic in autumn but also for all the structures and for the speech related to the energy efficiency and energy consumption of the buildings of health care I therefore repeat the vote in favour of the motion for a resolution Mr President allow me to express my special thanks to the Undersecretary Alessandra Sartore It has followed with attention and professionalism all the work of our Budget Commission and the work in this House 17.47 a.m."
RIVOLTA L SP PSd Az Mr President today this House gives a heartfelt greeting to David Sassoli a journalist a writer a television host a politician of standing President of the European Parliament who is no longer with us The news of his illness and death which came last night has upset us very much Taken by the frenzy of our activities we are stunned when a prominent personality disappears His death brings us back to a human plan of fragility and fleeting life The unanimous condolence that followed the news of David Sassoli 's death is due to the recognition of the value of man intellectual and politician Political convictions may also be opposed but the possibility of confrontation with men and women driven by high moral values great respect for institutions deep culture makes us understand the highest sense of democracy and the possibility of real progress in the community Sassoli convinced pro-Europeanist of Catholic formation advocated the need for the European institution to be ever closer to its citizens We agree with the issue of cultural identity recognition and enhancement of differences not forced type approval simplification Let us remember that his commitment as President of the European Parliament has always been intense and even at the end of his days aimed at a transfer of deliveries to and support the work of the institution To the family the backbone from which he drew his great inner strength to his wife Alessandra and to his children Giulio and Livia to all his colleagues and colleagues of the PD the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group expresses closeness and live condolences and honors a man who with his work and values has given lustre to our country
Mr President compared to the Update Note to the Document of Economics and Finance NADEF of 2021 with the financial forecasts we have seen a sharp deterioration in the update At first the country experienced the great pandemic crisis which had devastating effects on health but also on the economy and therefore on the lives of businesses and families There have also been damage to the perception of life so we have seen a suffering that has left deep signs because most people had never experienced such a dramatic moment made of renunciation fear many times also induced by a climate of terror let me say it In this regard I would like to hope that as in other European countries even in Italy against the omicron variant we will not arrive at a further closure because our country our entrepreneurs our families could not overcome this moment therefore I really hope that we will adapt to other countries and not repeat the closures This picture of suffering and difficulty at a time when thanks to the precise actions of the Government there was also a substantial recovery therefore an atmosphere of optimism it was certainly mentioned the whole theme of bonuses and superbonus which have accelerated the recovery we have fallen to the head this obsession of war with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia This is also an unexpected fact absolutely new and I must say that on this dramatic issue too I fear that information which must always be free will create an atmosphere of distress from morning to evening Maybe we do n't need to watch the war for 24 hours a day All wars are horrible and bring suffering but I think it would be more important for people to have less exposure to this bombardment In any case this is our situation We found ourselves dismayed as suddenly attacked on several fronts surely for a long time before we found ourselves attacked from the point of view of raw materials Already last year we were asking the question of the scarcity of raw materials which put in difficulty the companies that transformed and evidently caused an increase in prices Since last year there has been difficulty in finding steel already last year there was difficulty in finding plastic and wood so companies have found themselves having to stop this change and live with it The war further exploded this situation with an additional increase in energy costs As some colleagues have already pointed out it is necessary to reflect on the ecological transition which we all want is clear but I think we can say that at the moment we must have more plans one in the short one in the medium and one in the long term and certainly if in the long term we can think of alternatives in the short term we must make ourselves independent not only from Russian gas but absolutely we must use the resources that exist also in our country and that we have decided not to use If conditions have changed perhaps we must also change our approach which does not mean that we do not disown a medium and long term trend but it means saving our accounts and having less difficulty in finding natural gas for example We must undoubtedly discuss this otherwise it becomes a boomerang Why hurt us Not at all We really use common sense There are also other considerations that I want to make and concern the difficulties as everyone has already said of businesses and families I remember that one of the first measures taken under the 2019 Budget Act was that of the 400 million for municipalities for the safety of roads schools public buildings and so on That was the first expansive maneuver to give the municipalities the opportunity to provide with necessary works for the population The bonuses gave an additional input but in the municipalities we find ourselves unable to go ahead with the works because there was an indiscriminate increase in raw materials an increase certainly there may be but what happened also concerned voices that nothing has to do with a real increase and this is an exclusively speculative fact We must then take action on this too It is not possible to agree to see the work and the construction sites blocked with the budgets of the municipalities in difficulty and doing nothing There are dozens and dozens of implementing decrees that must be carried out and that are firm on which depends the proper functioning of municipalities businesses and families As local administrator I sometimes think that for the valiant who are in the Ministries for charity people undoubtedly of great value and competence some internships should be foreseen in the simple and humble Municipalities where life really takes place with citizens asking for short term answers The roads in fact have to be fixed Maybe the ceiling of a school suddenly shows cracks and you have to give answers quickly In this sense too therefore I think that there must be a meeting point between the activities of the Ministries between those who then have to lay down the implementing decrees and what must happen downstream in the Municipalities There is also another problem however that in the municipalities they find themselves having to stem it is the demand on the part of people the families of traders and businesses to have a simpler life there is an incredible social discomfort that is growing In the budget law and in other measures we have allocated strong resources to support psychological distress We have them for schools for women and so on We 've done a lot but that 's not enough It is not enough because we must treat society in the most serious way for there to be aggregation for there to be social peace for a moment of difficulty to be overcome all together We must think of a new humanism which starts with people who even in difficulty are willing not to break everything but to roll up their sleeves because there is a program But it must be a program from all over the country you can think of working of better crossing the demand with the supply which unfortunately with the income of citizenship has not been done The first part has been completed that of assistance but not that of job search and overcoming the difficulty We must try to bring these realities together A new country with a different perspective beyond the war can only be born if the family is re-founded which still remains the fundamental nucleus but must be put in the conditions to grow together to make everyone grow The same goes for the enterprise which must certainly think of the realization of the entrepreneur but also of the work the development and the realization of the workers It is a new country that we must have in mind Otherwise if this social cohesion and progress do not take place I fear that the gap will open up more and more and we will not really be able to think of a balanced and constructive development of our country We must move towards a new humanism I hope that many of you will be able to share and help this process for what we can do in this House And I think it may not be that small
Mr President what is happening in this House today is yet another proof that this Parliament is becoming an appendage of itself We have just heard the rapporteur Mrs Rivolta tell her that there has been no chance of working in the Budget Committee and that we have arrived in this House without having given the rapporteur a mandate This means that we have not been able to do anything in the Commission we have had 48 hours to examine this measure and despite the fact that only 110 amendments were tabled including 30 of this heterogeneous majority we have rejected any proposed amendments and in fact we are discussing a measure in the text approved by the House of Deputies Mr President it would have been nice to have been able to say that this decree law did not need to be amended but the truth is that we are faced with a measure that gives a bland answer to the problems of Italians So let us examine very quickly what the measure under consideration has received with a lofty name a bit like all the other measures that have taken place in the last two years The decree law on aid suggests that it should deal with problems and that it might solve some problems for the Italians Surely we have solved the problem of Minister Franceschini who is always very present in the decree laws that are approved in order to maintain his staff of collaborators to which the contract is extended we have also helped the navigators despite their symbol of the failure of the income of citizenship that they are also seen to extend contract and salary We have nothing against the navigators who are victims of a system that has not worked and which we have obviously always asked to cancel This measure also gives aid and aid to INPS 40 million for purchases of goods and services we even give ourselves the honour of giving Como a million euro for urgent road operations In a decree law that should address the theme of expensive bills expensive materials dear energy we give a million euros in fact to pave a road in the province of Como This and many other electoral tips are contained in the decree law in question and in the others that have succeeded in recent years In short we do n't deny a tip to anyone but someone has to explain to us what the collaborators of Franceschini the navigators the purchase of stationery for the INPS the interventions on roads and environment with everything that instead had to contain the measure in question Imagine if this majority who is thinking only of their own survival is able to really help the Italian people This rather than decreeing aid was to be called a blackmail decree by political forces of a majority that today will lose important pieces Someone 's probably already in the election campaign and we 're happy about that We 're happy about that We too look forward to the vote instead of attending this merciless theater of those who yesterday voted for the House 's trust and today instead will deny it in this Senate Chamber This is not the moment of the scenes and sad performances of sad figures However from this Government and from the coalition that supports it we could not expect anything different a mixture a coacervo of political forces too different from each other to be together was clearly doomed to fail a downward compromise that we have always denounced While outside this Chamber there is a country that is running out of steam a country in difficulty trying to get out of this economic crisis of inflation dear energy dear bill dear fuel this Government and this majority are fighting putting up vetoes discussing the income of citizenship and cannabis forgetting that this country is in canvas and that it is only using its arms to raise itself You have n't been able to agree with each other either You are a Brancaleone army bound only to power and to draw to life You have used the nobility of the emergency and national solidarity to make interests of power yours alone You have left this country to yourself in a guilty and instrumental way You are responsible before the Italians for not being able to be a ruling class at the moment when the country needed authoritative leadership You turned the aid into begging You 've made the Italians of the police That 's what you 'll reckon with the country soon because you 're pulling to live It is however a matter of a few months we have arrived The vote is very close We believe that after today 's vote we can no longer talk about the Dragon Government The holding of this majority is shattered under the Diktats of those who thought only of themselves and to gather some political consensus With this climate of blackmail begas internal quarrels of all against all you are holding the country hostage You could not produce anything good before let alone you can do it today trying to raise some extra vows and thinking that opposing yourself saves your face and saves your dignity We hope to see in a few hours time a leap of pride on the part of this House an awareness of an experience that has come to an end and we say so with all due respect for President Draghi whose authority unfortunately has not been sufficient to appease the appetites of some political forces Today perhaps except for other resounding blows of theater that famous and fateful day has arrived We send home this government and this failed majority enough with the Palace games We trust in the seriousness of Draghi who excluded a Draghi-a and we also trust in the role of the Head of State so that no more rabbits are taken out of the famous cylinder While in fact someone thinks of the reshuffle in order to hold on to the chair we clearly say that it is time to move on and return to the vote Let 's return to the vote and give the Italians the opportunity to choose a Government a strong Government that does the interests of the nation and not the interests of someone in particular Each of us today can vote according to conscience but be assured that from Brothers of Italy there will be no support as we have always done and that we will never be complicit in a coalition as bad as it is disastrous for our country
Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President I too agree with the thanks of my colleagues to Mr Sartore he has been an exceptional person with whom we have worked very well and we thank you for the intellectual honesty you have always represented in the work of the Commission So thank you Undersecretary for this end of the legislature We do not really appreciate the words spoken by my fellow Members because the only really positive aspect in this settlement in my opinion is indeed what the Undersecretary described namely that we have within this act the 14.3 billion that will be needed for the decree that tomorrow as it would seem will be issued by the Council of Ministers that we hope this time actually goes in the right direction that is to give real support to Italian families and businesses We are talking about an amount that can be as valuable as a budget law On the other hand the report and the adjustment that we are examining and voting on today contain only apparently positive data What we have noticed is that we are in the presence of documents with more revenue than expected We could clearly limit ourselves to sharing them but it is also right to understand where these resources come from The documents today clearly tell us one thing there is an increase in the tax burden ranging from 37.9 to 38.4 percent an additional 0.5 that is not a small thing the usual recipe of the left able to put his hands in the pocket of the Italian taxpayers We must infer that the increase in the tax burden is directly linked to the increase in the Irpef which leads to the fact that the levy on self employed workers and employees is likely to cause this increase in income in the state 's coffers It 's always them in the end who pay Regardless of the fact that increasing taxes is an issue that we never agree with this increase in fiscal pressure cries with the increase in public debt which goes even to 152.6 percent Then we have to think that something does not work it increases taxes and increases the deficit of the state which is among the worst in Europe and comparing it to the rest of the world things are not getting better Then we should ask ourselves how this money is spent because this should be the spirit of the documents we are examining We are certainly not satisfied with this because we must point out once again that for two years now this House and this Parliament have been complicit in the waste we have denounced in all these years of tens of billions of euros resources that were to be used to counter the pandemic and instead have scattered into thousands of relics in unproductive bonuses at best or worse in tips to friends and friends of friends We as Brothers Italy have never been opposed to the increase in debt regardless but we would like to see good debt debt for investments debt for growth debt for transactions that benefit Italian taxpayers We have n't seen any of this in the last two years On the contrary a bad debt has been produced the clear example of this bad debt has given it to the Government that has misspent the state 's money it is all in the 9 billion a year that are allocated on the income of citizenship You see we have not gone crazy we are not opposed to this measure without it but it still appears today as an active labour policy when it was a welfare policy that did not work the way it should have We are not opposed to combating poverty we think that a just state does not put on the same footing who can work and who cannot do it as it does with the income of citizenship Then we give aid and support as Giorgia Meloni says to those who cannot work and we create active labour policies that allow those who are in a position to be employed It is a matter of dignity ladies and gentlemen On the account and on the adjustment there is a question that it is opportune to ask behind the coldness of these numbers can the Government say that it has left a better Italy than it has found it We certainly do not think so because without questioning the authority of Premier Draghi a majority as varied and heterogeneous as the one who claimed it could produce nothing good We have seen timid reforms made only in the name of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan which will unfortunately be transformed on many missed occasions As I said before we have seen billions of euros distributed here and there without being used for long term projects because there has been a lack of a vision of the country a vision that can only have a government with a solid majority with clear ideas and projects consistent with its political history all things that unfortunately were not there in the majority that we are going to leave behind A government that unites everything and the opposite of everything could not go far we have always said so in recent years and the events of the past weeks culminated with the early dissolution of the Chambers are proof that unfortunately we were right You will obviously have to account for all this to the Italian people in a little over forty days time but since you have so far preferred to account only to yourself to your self referentiality our vote on these two measures will only be a vote against
Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President with regard to the report before us today we have the same attitude as we have in the past when for example we have approved a series of deviations that have led this country to borrow EUR 200 million Before we go into the substance of the report I would like to make some general comments because today we are adopting a measure which is the first in loose Chambers The proof is that the early end of the legislature is absolutely not leading to the country 's paralysis and the report we are approving today goes in this direction For months it has been said that voting was now irresponsible and many of these accusations have been directed against our political strength which is the only one of opposition It was said in fact that there were the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and various decrees in expiration and that it was necessary to combat inflation the expensive bills the increase in the cost of raw materials and everything that could lead to the increase in prices that there was Imagine if we of Brothers of Italy were not in the front row when we talked about defending and securing our Italy system For months however we were told that nothing could be done with the early vote Today on the other hand in loose chambers and with a government in office only to deal with current affairs we are here to vote on a report to give the Commission permission to resort to debt that is in time This debt in fact is only because there is no budgetary adjustment which is in the House of Deputies and it must be voted on Therefore when there is final approval in the other branch of Parliament the anticipation of EUR 14.3 billion will in fact become a simple round This is the first time we have voted on an act without any debt to our children Let us tell the Italians the truth then it is not true that there is paralysis because there is a government in office there is a Parliament still in office and it will be until the next Parliament is established scheduled for 13 October So those who told the opposite were obviously lying knowing they were lying Colleagues it is not a question of irresponsibility but of political will if you want to act for the good of the Italians you do so without stirring ghosts or ghosts and the measure we are discussing today demonstrates this Real immobilism on the other hand is not that of the few weeks that divide us from the vote but it is that of the past months and years with a pandemic that destroyed the country a war that has inflicted a further hard blow to our economy and a dear life that has come overpoweringly to crumble Italian companies and families In the past months we should have given answers and been as efficient as we are today with a decree that arrives in the Chamber to be voted in record times the real irresponsible are not us of Brothers of Italy who asked to go to the vote the real irresponsible are those who in recent months have kept the country in check hostage of the internal quarrels of a majority that has crumbled and of cross vetoes of the parties that have played on the skin of the Italians This was unfortunately the real reason that broke down Italian families and businesses In order to restart the country it was therefore necessary to turn the page and dismiss this legislature born badly and ended worse in which three majorities turned out to be a communion of parties that had nothing in common totally inadequate and heterogeneous majorities to face the challenges that history and the circumstances have proposed to us a terrible economic crisis triggered by a violent pandemic a war at the gates of Europe and now a galloping inflation Fortunately in a few weeks all this will be just a memory because Italians will have the opportunity to choose a coalition that is not a mixture of everything and the opposite of everything only to gather votes but on the contrary a communion of programs objectives and intentions aimed at giving the country back the greatness it deserves This is our wish to which as Brothers of Italy and as center right all of us are working In order to enter into the substance of this measure today we allow as I said before a temporary debt of EUR 14.3 million which we will not leave to future generations We agree to make this effort but provided that this time the resources are used as reported in the report signed by President Draghi and Minister Franco in black and white to help yes this time families businesses and public bodies to counter the price increases of energy products to combat inflation the consequences of the continuation of the pandemic and the consequences of drought We agree Undersecretary that this time the amounts of the extratragettito that we are receiving as a result of the increases of all these goods and services will be returned to the Italians through the aid that will be given with the next decree With the measures contained in the measure that we are funding we hope to see concrete interventions and no longer as unfortunately happened in the recent past tips bonuses and prebende which have turned out to be only palliative We want to see VAT cut on basic necessities We want to see the excise cuts on fuels extended and the social charges for electricity and gas bills cancelled We want to see the tax credits on bills extended for energy companies thus correcting also the mistakes that prevented companies from taking advantage of this last important facility What we do not want Undersecretary members of the Government President let us say clearly as we have already denounced in the recent past is that these 14 billion are used to finance some of the electoral districts as happened in part with the 200 billion that have disappeared in a thousand streams Too many resources have been wasted in these years of pandemics Let us ensure that at least this last provision is not used to do the interests of someone but rather to be aimed at the true common good We would not like to be in this House in a few weeks to report yet another gift to friends and friends of friends If that happens we 'll sue him heavily Therefore our vote as we have always said today will be in favour not of a government that we have opposed in every way not of a majority that has melted like snow in the sun but of a measure that goes in the direction of doing what has never been done so far really helping the Italian people Of course we are aware that the 14 billion and some further extension will not be enough because many problems must be fought at the source but this is no longer the task of President Draghi it is no longer the task of this Parliament it is no longer the task of this Government The new Parliament and the new Government which must be an expression of the Italian vote will take care of this Waiting for all this to happen we are sure that on this measure and for that little time remaining at this legislature you will find as has always been the willingness of Brothers of Italy to work and to legislate on everything that goes in the direction of helping our system Italy As I have already announced in the premises the vote of Brothers of Italy will therefore be favorable
Mr President from a decree law that has such a fanciful title cuts prices we would have sincerely expected much more especially for Italian companies and families that are now exhausted Perhaps the measure in our examination tries to do something clearly also with reference to expensive energy and expensive bills but it does so as always in a very mild and temporary way without having a solution in the medium and long term therefore always using buffer solutions You have extended the cut in excise duties on fuels and we are clearly very pleased about that but this does not solve the problem underlying the speculation on prices that exists and is very clear The theme of speculation was not raised by the Brothers of Italy party but your Government and in particular your ministers Cingolani and Patuanelli If you have identified the source of this problem for more than a few months now why do you keep looking Honestly we still can't understand it You have extended from April to June the possibility of indemnifying electricity and gas bills even this is only a palliative intervention because installment certainly does not solve the problem Postponing and delaying a payment does not mean in any way reducing the extent to which the same payment is imposed on Italian households and companies We would also have expected more effective action on this issue It is therefore clear that you know how to put only patches to these interventions without reaching what we have always been asking for since the beginning of the pandemic emergency and the beginning of the conflict structural solutions which are not there and it is not even predictable that they can be there With this decree law allowed to pay the bills in installments with the next intervention you will give 200 euros to pay the bills and do the shopping A measure that costs € 6 billion in public contributions This figure is added to the EUR 7 billion allocated in the budget law to make that ephemeral operation We agree when it comes to reducing taxes but we are talking about EUR 7 billion to reduce the Irpef rates by 2 points and no one has noticed the tax savings you have always talked about It is therefore billions of euros that do not create a multiplier effect and therefore do not allow a bounce of the domestic product What then about the reform of the land register which increases the tax levy on the house Who knows if in the next decree you will introduce the asset so dear to the Italian left With the measure we are considering today we allow the municipalities with the red boxes to raise the additional Irpefs which are burdening our taxpayers Therefore with one hand give and with the other resume What 's the point of all this Someone should probably explain it a little better than you 've done until today We did not expect miracles from this decree because we do not like demagogy However it is clear that the problems we face have distant origins and are the children of an energy policy in the sign of extreme environmentalism the consequence of which has been to make Italy totally not self sufficient and dependent on imports from abroad Someone will have to take responsibility for this Today we hear about the total blockade of Russian oil and gas We fully support the sanctions against Russia but what we do not want is that in order to hit Russia our companies will be affected and perhaps even sunk by them We therefore ask the Government not only to evaluate the possible alternatives to energy supply but also to reverse the trend that has so far seen us take out of our home what we could have from resources that our country is certainly not short of Italy risks paying a very high price indeed it is already paying it considering the families that do not arrive at the end of the third week of the month and will certainly not be able to rely on the umpteenth bonus that with this decree and with the next ones will be given Businesses are on their knees and some as you all know have also stopped production We believe that Europe cannot turn on the other side this time We need to review the policies of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan as we have said and said again and so many of you have said that they could not predict and have not predicted this new crisis due to the increase in raw materials and the war in Ukraine Similarly a new recovery fund is needed an energy recovery fund to support those countries indirectly affected by the consequences of the conflict On this we expect President Mario Draghi to put in place all his authority so that there will be a diplomatic escalation in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine The problem is that in order to deal with this emergency we would need a solid and less heterogeneous Government than there is with a clear vision of the country and the future everything that this Government obviously does not have The political forces that make it up do not agree with anything Just at a time when it would take a sense of responsibility all they do is pick up the Commission 's estate as we have seen today I have heard the President of the Budget Committee and some colleagues have asked if Senator Pesco has gone to the opposition I say this to indicate the holding of this majority As Brothers of Italy we were prophets in saying from the first day that this majority did not have too much way to go because it was and is too different to be together Time is gallant man and unfortunately things are right In conclusion we will continue to denounce everything that is happening as we are doing in recent years particularly with this de facto monocameralism Today we are faced with yet another vote of confidence on yet another decree coming to this House We will always make complaints loudly and we will raise our voice to tell Italy as a whole that while the country is struggling with the worst crisis since the post war period your priority is back to being a proportional electoral reform We are talking about this these days and it seems that the Democratic Party is even willing to bring this reform to the House You do this in order to find a way to guarantee you because only this can serve that armchair you did not want to separate from and that in any case in a few months you will have to leave since the legislature is now coming to an end We as Brothers of Italy do not fear the return to the polls nor strange electoral laws We will continue to call for a return to the vote as soon as possible because Italy deserves a strong government that is up to the situation and not a bunch of parties that are all and the opposite of everything and that not even an authoritative President of the Council has been able to lead
Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President first of all we want to announce as the Brothers of Italy Group the vote in favour of this bill to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the death of Giacomo Matteotti who will fall on 10 June 2024 When he was killed Matteotti was only thirty nine years old but behind him already had a long political commitment started over twenty years before and lived surely with courage and passion which had earned him the nickname of Tempesta In fact he had very often taken uncomfortable and difficult positions During the First World War he expressed himself so strongly against Italy 's participation in the conflict that he was sentenced to the border in Sicily from 1916 to 1918 Back in political activity since 1919 he has been among the hardest opponents of fascism of which he often denounced violent actions In 1920 and 1921 as part of the Italian Socialist Party he opposed the communist faction which had not yet given birth to a party on its own In 1922 a few days before the march on Rome he was expelled from the party together with Filippo Turati Giuseppe Modigliani Claudio Treves and others all accused by the maximalists of breaking the principle of non-cooperation with the so called bourgeois parties for having participated in the consultations of the king for the formation of the new government The expulsions founded the United Socialist Party of which Matteotti became national secretary Elected in 1919 and 1921 it was also elected in the April 1924 elections with the new electoral law that awarded a majority prize to the list that was the most voted on provided it exceeded 25 of the valid votes The results published by the Ministry of the Interior attributed 60 percent of the votes to the national list led by Benito Mussolini which included not only fascist candidates but also several liberals such as Orlando Salandra former popular Catholic and many others On May 30 Giacomo Matteotti intervened in the Chamber of Deputies stating that no Italian elector had found himself free to decide with his will because of the intimidation of the fascist militias during the stage of presentation of the lists during the electoral campaign and also in the seats As a result he stated that it was doubtful whether the national list had obtained that 25 percent necessary for the majority prize and therefore the election of his candidates should not be validated Eleven days later on the 10th of June the day on which his new intervention was expected in the Chamber which had left his home on the lungotevere he was forcibly loaded into a car by a team of five men part of a secret fascist group linked to the Viminal who had chosen the name of Ceka that is that of the Soviet political police According to the reconstructions Matteotti continued to defend himself with great vigor trying to get rid of himself and one of the kidnappers fatally struck him with a dagger The five ended up burying the body briefly not far from Rome where it was found casually two months later Amerigo Dumini who was in charge of the team was arrested two weeks later From a political point of view the affair put Prime Minister Mussolini in great difficulty for months who was referred to by many as the principal who came out of it with the address to the House of 3 January 1925 in which he stated that he assumed every responsibility for what had happened From the judicial point of view in 1926 Dumini and two other men on the team were sentenced to four years three of which were cancelled by an amnesty for preterintentional murder In 1947 a new trial was held in which Dumini was sentenced to life imprisonment for premeditated murder Six years later however he was released by virtue of the amnesty promoted and wanted by Palmiro Togliatti head of the Communist Party The teaching that must be drawn from the figure and the story of Giacomo Matteotti apart from the refusal and condemnation of violence in the political confrontation wherever it comes from and the importance of respect for democratic rules which we believe to be obvious but which is always good to reiterate is that of always defending the right which for a parliamentarians for a political exponent is also a duty of denouncing the distortions and criticizing what is thought to endanger the institutions in that case the regularity of the elections of expressing their own beliefs on what is the good of the nation and its institutions and of criticizing facts and people who are believed to oppose them We hope that all this will emerge in studying and celebrating the figure of Giacomo Matteotti on the centenary of his death I would like to conclude by quoting a sentence from James Matteotti's dramatic speech of May 30 1924 To the President of the House who invited him to continue his speech despite the interruptions of many opponents but to do so prudently he replied I ask to speak not prudently nor imprudently but verbally Here the parliamentarians must always speak as such expressing their beliefs about what is the interest of the nation and its fellow citizens This is our right and even more our duty which Matteotti has impersonated to the extreme consequences For these reasons I repeat the vote in favour of the parliamentary group Fratelli d'Italia
Minister this question arises on the basis of some of your statements to the press in recent days in which you have said that the superbonus has worked but it is drugging construction while there are other sectors that need to be followed such as automotive where the switch to electricity risks creating an explosion in terms of employment Certainly the scenario you set out is serious and worthy of attention but we do not quite understand the purpose Until now for twenty years now the car sector has always been used as an ATM by the State Now we seem to understand from his words that the automotive needs support but he cannot receive them because the superbonus has been introduced We do not think that this is the approach to be taken in this case The superbonus was a great opportunity for the construction sector proof of this is that it has favoured the birth of thousands of companies has facilitated the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs and has generated important revenues for the state 's coffers in terms of VAT Irpef Ires and IRAP which have come from those tax payments related to the thousands of yards opened in the past year You see Minister that is not what we say about Brothers of Italy but that is what authoritative studies of the sector and analyses made also by our parliamentary offices in the budget say We would not like his words to reveal the desire to favour a sector that rightly needs attention but to the detriment of another that has worked very well and that apart from the scams that have been there and that undoubtedly must be opposed by all means does not deserve the stop that is being imposed on him in these days since the decree law supports b with the umpteenth retroactive modification that only creates confusion uncertainty and restrains investment by honest entrepreneurs So Minister with this question of ours we ask you whether you can in any way give assurances about the initiatives that the Government intends to take to give certainty to this sector PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Economic Development Mr Giorgetti has the floor to answer the question which has just been put for three minutes
"Minister I do not share your answer at all because you refer to people who have EUR 300,000 or EUR 400,000 in income and to those who have the fourth or fifth homes In the meantime it does n't work that way because we stop at the main house and at most at the second house But I can also tell you that we spend EUR 10 billion on citizenship income so demagogy by demagogy let us try to tell ourselves clearly how things are We could use a lot of these sums for the subject we are dealing with today However regardless of these considerations your reply Minister does not convince us We have confidence that as far as the measure of the superbonus is concerned we have given answers to thousands of families and thousands of companies that represent the backbone of our country 's economic system We hope that the measure of the superbonus may no longer be changed since since it was introduced we have had 13 or 14 changes and that we can proceed with an orderly path that allows us to arrive at the natural expiry of these bonuses that as you know are imminent the sismabonus purchases will expire on 30 June while the superbonus of 110 percent will expire on 31 December 2022 for single family houses and 31 December 2023 for condominiums If we want to then it is a question of giving some legal certainty and avoiding the retroactivity of the rule I hope therefore that there will be a further recovery from the issue of superbonus"
"Mr President I would like to join in the thanks of the majority rapporteurs to Mr Pesco who has always used a great deal of attention in the work of the Budget Committee to this decree law However let me also say that for the umpteenth time we are discussing a decree law that will see the intervention of a single Chamber so we are faced with a de facto monocameralism and yet another vote of confidence It is a fact that we cannot pickle The rapporteurs are right when they say that this de facto decree is overcome by events but I would like to point out that the measure was already insufficient and exceeded even before 27 January and before the conflict between Russia and Ukraine On this we must be intellectually honest I will give some figures showing that this decree was already passed when it was issued by the Council of Ministers It is a text with weak and insufficient measures Among the speeches I would like to mention in Article 1 which contains support measures for closed activities including discotheques a fund of just EUR 20 million is allocated slightly increased with the amendments to the decree which are small if we consider that this sector has ceased its activity for almost two years reopening with limitations only in the summer months and briefly before the last wave of pandemics which saw them remain closed until a month ago The sector calculates losses of 1.2 billion euros and has seen tens and hundreds of companies surrender closing their activities These numbers are enough to understand why the resources are completely insufficient Another area on its knees is tourism to which Article 4 allocates an increase of EUR 100 million in the National Tourism Fund which was established under the last budget law This fund was provided with EUR 280 million and today it has an additional 100 million i.e. 380 a budget which has been defined by the category as largely insufficient In fact in order for the resources to be at least sufficient they would have had to be at least doubled The same applies to the EUR 200 million fund for the relaunch of economic and retail activities which is also largely insufficient to help a sector with a deficit of EUR 1.7 billion to return to pre-pandemic levels On these scenarios which are certainly worrying there is the shadow of the expensive bills which have already been mentioned by my fellow rapporteurs which are at least in conflict with the measures contained in this decree law Statistics today tell us that the price of gas has increased by more than 600 per cent compared to 2020 similarly made the price of electricity and without this the measure we examine is limited to granting facilities to energy companies even these insufficient ones giving instead limited benefits to many small and medium sized enterprises that will also suffer from the expensive energy In our opinion this decree lacks a structural vision to solve the problem because we need an imposing intervention from Europe we need to reason in terms of deviations and this Government is still not convinced it does not talk about it and President Draghi continues to niche on this aspect We need a new recovery fund because if we do not go in this direction we alone will not be able to solve these problems because we lack the awareness that we have put in place faulty energy policies which have been made in the name of extreme environmentalism and a no regardless of any plant We have brought Italy to depend totally on the foreign countries for its supplies The approach contained in this decree law is entirely temporary and aimed at buffering only partially an emergency that as I said before exploded before the tensions between Russia and Ukraine and is clearly destined to worsen with the ongoing conflict Confindustria estimates that from 2019 to 2021 the cost of energy for manufacturing increased from 8 billion in 2019 to 21 in 2021 up to 37 billion in 2022 Faced with these numbers analysis by the CGIA di Mestre points out that the interventions of this decree law cover only 6 of all the increases that have occurred which in the meantime put at risk 500,000 jobs We risk employment and we need to intervene with structural measures which this and the previous decree laws have never done We must also say something about Article 28 the case of the superbonus which shows how this Government operates We all agreed that scams should be restrained avoided but obviously if they were there there is only one person responsible this Government the Government of the Best Moreover the Revenue Agency has spoken clearly and has given us certain numbers in relation to the scams As for the 110 percent building bonus only 3 percent is related to scams are other bonuses that have had a big problem so the excitement that has led to about 14 changes in two years for this incentive appears to have rather fragile bases The hope is that the new corrections just inserted will be the last correctives to give to Italian families and companies who want to take advantage of this incentive at least legal certainty as should happen in a civil state Unfortunately with these interventions in the name of combating fraud the Government has managed to strike one of the few sectors that showed a genuine rebound that of building While GDP increased by 6.5 in 2021 this is due to a third of the construction sector which in the past year alone marked an increase in output by 24 11.8 in employment 27.7 in hours worked and 16.4 in investment All of this has been translated into greater revenue for the state 's coffers as have also certified the Budget Offices with regard to VAT Irpef Ires and IRAP Article 28 was clearly exceeded by the provisions introduced by Decree Law No 13 of 2022 Finally the subject of the scrap b and the balance and excavation it is true there has been a further step there has been an improvement but it is not enough It 's too little because nobody says what is involved in scraping b it covers until 2017 it keeps out all the periods that preceded and followed the pandemic 2018 2019 2020 first year of pandemic 2021 are not covered The break up b is a postponement of the terms of problems that have occurred until 2017 therefore it is necessary to go further it needs more courage It is not enough to measure the postponement of a deadline among other things a few months We must intervene on this It is said that resources are needed although in the first and second years we knew that there is even a greater revenue I said stop at the first three years I do n't know what the state 's accounts can provide but I 'm not convinced that the c break up can't be done because there are no resources The hope is that the trend can finally be reversed without waiting further for the end of the emergencies affecting the planet also because in addition to the pandemic and war related emergency we risk adding a democratic emergency a possibility that we all want and should avoid"
Mr President we are proud and delighted to speak today on a subject for which a bill of parliamentary initiative is finally being called into question In fact as you know Mr Undersecretary it has unfortunately not been possible in recent years since we have been clogged up by the urgent decree that has not allowed us to do the work that Parliament is called upon to do to put the initiative of its Members at the centre This is a happy moment for us a time when a bill signed by one of our colleagues Senator Iannone of the Brothers of Italy introduces a change in the Constitution aimed at recognizing the importance of sport filling a serious present gap evidently before this moment Brothers of Italy through this amendment demanded that Article 32 of the Constitution be added a paragraph that would protect sports activities and guarantee access to sports practice The original text stated The Republic also protects health through the promotion of activities aimed at engaging and developing the psychomotor skills of people and facilitates access to sports practice With this reading sport and health are made complementary to each other and therefore sport is recognized and counted among fundamental constitutional rights such as education health and environmental protection bearer of values such as fair competition and solidarity Italy clearly adapts to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that the Union contributes to the promotion of European profiles of sport taking into account its specific features its structures based on volunteering and its social and educational function Italy with the approval of this amendment to the Constitution would also make a further step forward compared to other European countries since the recognition of the value of sport in the Constitution to date exists only in a few European states such as Bulgaria Croatia Greece Lithuania Poland Portugal Romania Spain and Hungary The text submitted to the Assembly is the summary of a series of different but convergent constitutional bills presented by various different parliamentary groups and proposes through its only article to add a paragraph to Article 33 of the Constitution The provision provides that the Republic recognizes the educational social and promotional value of the psychophysical well being of sports activity in all its forms The content of this value is then declined in three directions that are not in hierarchical relationship with each other but equiordained and complementary The placement in Article 33 made it preferable to indicate first the educational value for the growth and training of the person This is accompanied by social value sport is often an antidote to degradation and social exclusion it is the basis of countless realities in the third sector and in general it is a powerful factor of aggregation at all levels including the entire national community Finally there is the value for health declined from the text in the most specific terms of promoting psychophysical well being to indicate a positive understanding of the concept of health not only as absence of pathologies but as an improvement of the physical and mental conditions of each individual We hope Mr President in Office that the approval of this amendment will take place soon to this end everyone 's cooperation will be important In our view before the end of this parliamentary term we could have this rule in the Constitution This will depend on the will of Parliament but also of the Government The successive governments over the years seem to have recognized the value of sport only when Italy won the European Football Championship when Berrettini arrived in the final at Wimbledon or when the Ferrari returned to make their fans dream again Sport before being passionate must be well being sport arrives where state and institutions often fail to reach helping to spread the values on which our national identity is based For Brothers of Italy it is not a question of a flag because for us sport is exactly the opposite It is no coincidence that Giorgia Meloni in these years of pandemic has asked several times to have the sport taken up again obviously in safety not as access to the stadium but as a sport activity Sport in fact is life and it makes no sense to have facilities gyms and swimming pools closed and see public transport full of people In this regard our national leader in these years of pandemics has waged a battle Mr Undersecretary before the pandemic sport generated 4 of our national gross domestic product Now he is on his knees many realities have closed down and those who resist very often do so in the total indifference of the State who has not been able to give strong and concrete help and indeed with the history of the super greenpass has cut out many teenagers many of our children from sports activities interrupting dreams ambitions but also strong occasions of sociality 17.28 Followed by Mr Calandrini We of Brothers of Italy hope that the approval of the norm and its incorporation into the Constitution will also help to avoid such distortions in the future We hope then that the adoption of the bill will be the beginning of the reversal of a path with greater attention to politics in the world of sport and perhaps also that it will be evident in the restoration of a Ministry dedicated to this competence
Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President I would like to join the majority rapporteurs in thanking the Commission for its work which has certainly been carried out in an orderly manner although very compressed in relation to the times for the continuous majority meetings in order to try to find an overall balance in some way with the maxi amendment that is coming to this House today As I said yesterday when I spoke as a minority rapporteur however we denounce and continue to strongly denounce this sort of change of pace that has occurred in this legislature and that has no precedent that is the alternating monocameralism that has actually modified the Constitution so we have moved from a perfect bicameralism to an imperfect bicameralism On this we will not make discounts because it is not possible to continue in this direction with this protagonism of the government that is unprecedented in the country It is indeed a very embarrassing situation for an advanced democracy such as that of our country To come to the subject on the agenda I would also like to say to the rapporteurs that this decree is passed yes but not because of the events linked to the war that is somehow at the door of our Europe because the problem is also a precedent because already on 27 January when it was approved by the Council of Ministers this decree was completely inadequate I spoke about this yesterday by chaosing a series of numbers referring to all the sectors concerned who already at that time had no additional resources to deal with the dramatic situation that they were experiencing because of the pandemic As I said we are in the presence of a decree law that instead of supporting the business world is killing many sectors in particular the building sector inserting yet another anti-fraud correction that penalizes even the honest people who in this last year have operated with honesty regarding this measure I would like to take the example of another simple amendment without any problem of cover which provided for the move of at least three months of the deadline for single family houses from 30 June to 30 September to allow progress to be made Considering the fourteen changes made to this superbonus was the least that could be expected Well even on this amendment there was not the courage on the part of the Government and the majority to give an answer On this we are absolutely not available and are not optimistic about the issues under consideration since on the superbonus we all agree to have to curb the scams but not as we wanted to do with this decree- law because the Revenue Agency also confirmed that the scams for this measure affected only 3 This fierceness which led to about fourteen changes appears completely inadequate and has rather fragile bases So we hope that at least in the final phase of this measure we will allow ourselves to continue in an orderly way so that until December 31 2023 Italian families and companies can be allowed to give answers regarding the economic thrust that this decree can give us for those numbers that I gave yesterday when I explained what construction represents for our country system We are in the presence of a decree law that is largely insufficient The outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine has made it completely useless and overcome by the events that have been there but also by situations prior to the conflict that has been generated For example there is the question of expensive energy which I would like to remind you was already present in the budget law because we have tried to shift sums even some of the sums that were expected to reduce taxes which no one could verify because of those eight billions planned for the Irpef scales nobody noticed Without prejudice to the fact that we are always in favour of reducing taxes we said that multiplier effects had to be created There are 10 billion citizens income I want to remind you because this year the Government of the best has put us even one billion euros more and we have gone from 9 to 10 billion plus the eight billion of the reduction of taxes We said to move them at least in part to create that multiplier effect on national gross domestic product in support of small and medium sized enterprises which represent 80 of Italian companies and are the backbone of the country 's economic system To the dear energy has also been added an unjustified expensive fuels Today we see that in neighbouring countries as my colleague Mr Misiani mentioned like neighbouring Slovenia we have put a roof at the price of fuel one litre of petrol costs EUR 1.50 while we have even reached almost EUR 2.50 and we do not understand why we do not do the same things that our neighbouring countries do So there 's a VAT extraject I want to remind you that we 're cashing in and that extrajective can also be used to do this kind of operation but there 's no time The time has expired dear Undersecretary Sartore I thank you for your helpfulness but you cannot tell us that you have taken notes on certain issues so you have rightly referred to some of the amendments saying that we have adopted legal amendments in this case Even in some cases he referred to authentic interpretations That is true but today we need more today we are at war Today Draghi told us I want to quote what he said that we went from a market economy to a war economy But when you make these statements you also need consequent acts so that you can give answers on these issues So if we do not start with this assumption and start making additional taxes on raw materials or fuels as I said sooner or later we will arrive at the absurdity that petrol in Italy will cost 2.5 euros and in neighbouring Slovenia it will cost 1.5 euros I want to add something very clear This is the time of decisions it is the time of responsibility it is not the time to invent as you have done over the past few weeks the reform of the land register referred to in Article 6 of the law delegates for tax reform which affects how much more valuable there is for the Italians their home As our national leader also said you lie knowing you 're lying In fact the additional tax on the house is there because the rules that accompany Article 6 say it we want to increase the extimes in order to tax and particularly hit the main house in order to compensate for the taxes on labour This is the rule set out in Article 6 Above all you are dusting the ius soli under the lie of the law on citizenship These are the slaps in the face that the Italians do not want to take they suffer At this time immigrants are coming to Europe and Italy and we must be aware that we must welcome these people with open arms who are fleeing from a real war which is what Russia and Ukraine are now investing in We here today must assume our responsibilities but we need Europe 's direct intervention otherwise we can not do it You continue to say that there can be no talk of deviation even that it is dangerous to do so when until six months ago you have committed EUR 200 billion in budgetary deviation committing our children and grandchildren for the next 50 years today we must be careful to talk about deviation However we need Europe 's intervention If you do not want to talk about deviation we are talking about safeguard clauses we must prevent the stability pact from coming into force in Italy because there are no conditions We need a new recovery plan a war recovery plan Targeted measures are needed in respect of raw materials and bills targeted aid is also needed at work to create that multiplier effect that drives the economy to start again Having no more time I am going to conclude Mr President We will be on the side of the Italians and not of the Dragon Government because it disappointed us We will certainly be on the side of the Italian people hoping that President Draghi together with the majority will think of businesses families and farmers Today in fact families are afraid of receiving the electricity bill or going to the gas station to make a full of gasoline that 's exactly what we did n't want that did n't serve this government This on the other hand is what the government is doing So we for this reason and for many other reasons that I do not have time to explain will not vote in favour and will vote against the question of confidence in this measure
"Mr President first of all we would like to denounce the umpteenth institutional scorn that is taking place in this House President Draghi's pressure for the approval of this bill has no equal The hypothesis of a vote of confidence is a serious outrage to Parliament which has passed into the general silence of all the institutions By the government that defines the best by President Draghi who has a vast majority at his disposal we would have expected much more and something different On the other hand this Government continues to proceed by votes of confidence fifty in a little more than a year and by pressure as it did on this occasion we are talking about delegitimizing the role of this Parliament once again We want to remind President Draghi that the difference between the members of this House and his person is that we are legitimately elected representatives of the people while the President is an expression of a government born of palace games President Draghi always complains about the quarrels of the parties that support him but what did he expect from this government that is so heterogeneous We of the Brothers of Italy have always said from the first day that this majority is too different to be together and cannot bring anything positive compared to all these acts that we see approved in this House In this bill that we are about to convert into law in fact there is nothing good to save Inside there are provisions that literally cry out for revenge Our beaches were sacrificed for the estate of a majority who lost face lost dignity but obviously is not losing the chair Only the Group of Brothers of Italy has remained to defend 30,000 Italian companies that today are being expropriated their activity of a lifetime in the name of a competition that is all but fair competition As we have said in these weeks in these months a small company cannot buy the multinationals that will come once again to Italy to shop and grab many excellences built with years of sweat and sacrifices This agreement reached by the majority these days is embarrassing Do you really think that these compensations will restore dignity to those to whom you are deceiving the bathing establishments that have laboriously built started made jewels that have brought up the name of Italy and our sea in the world We do not know how much these compensations will amount to when they are paid on the basis of what criteria will be granted and how they will be calculated The agreement reached by this majority to allow the shameful application of the Bolkestein Directive is based on a we see then The truth is that the owners of today 's bathing concessions have been left without any kind of protection and then do n't tell us that the beaches are a caste as I heard in some intervention before mine that they pay ridiculous costs for their bathing concessions meanwhile because the amounts of concessions established them by the Ministry of Economic Development with an ad hoc decree and therefore if there was the need to increase them there was enough a decree But nobody talks not even in this House about the costs that the dealers themselves have to bear which are tenfolded in relation to the cost of the concession for the rescue at sea for the buoys for the cleaning of the beach for the storage Nobody talks about this Mr President The truth is that with this bill Italy not only gives the sovereignty of all its beaches to people we do not know today but also gives its sovereignty to the European Union The serious thing is that only Italy is accepting these impositions Spain Croatia and Portugal have extended their bathing concessions We do not understand why Italy could not do the same I 'm gonna finish A righteous government would defend its family jewels with its nails and teeth A government with sovereignist traction would never make discounts to anyone in order not to perpetrate the disaster that is taking place today But a government such as the one in office which has only its own survival at heart cannot do the national interest less so with a majority divided over everything We of Brothers of Italy will never tire of asking you to acknowledge the failure that is on the whole line Step aside do it for the good of the country and let the Italians choose who they are governed by"
"Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President we would like to point out also in the light of the speech by the rapporteur of the League on the measure to which our colleague Mr Iannone will reply more fully in an explanation of vote on the overall measure basically three issues which have been the subject of the sub- amendments we have tabled in Article 2 These issues are basically the no to the Bolkestein Directive resulting in the no to the auctions and last the no to the expropriation of Italian work Let us say this because we believe that the Bolkestein directive should not be applied with regard to goods and services In our opinion this directive should not and should not be applied on goods We have said this in a thousand different ways there were the conditions for opposing it but obviously neither the Government nor this branch of Parliament have done anything for this to happen Consequentially as I said before we remain opposed to the auctions of a fundamental structure for our economy that are our beaches on which 30,000 Italian companies have founded a tourism of excellence which has made Italy one of the most sought after destinations in the world where to spend the summer holidays and not only Finally let 's also say no to the expropriation of Italian work As you all know and we know with this measure we take away from 30,000 companies the fruit of the work of a lifetime treating the holders of these concessions as a caste of privileged Mr President we have also heard this in this House we have heard that the beaches are a caste of privileged people However no one has said that if they have paid minimum concessions the responsibility is of the Government which through the decrees has never raised the amounts of these concessions In addition nobody says what the costs are which have been tenfold in terms of bathing concessions rescue at sea buoys cleaning of the beaches and storage are all the costs for bathing dealers But nobody talks about this and speculates by saying that the amounts are very low because obviously no one has ever thought of increasing them That is also why we are against it This bill refers in its title to competition but the truth is that with these contents the only competition it will produce will be unfair but unfortunately unfair competition PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator Calandrini I do not know if you were referring to the amendments tabled by Brothers of Italy to Article 2 or to Article 3 Mr Calandrini FdI In the Commission the sub-amendments to Article 2 PRESIDENT The debate is closed He did not specify that these were the amendments tabled to the Commission I would also like to point out that the quota periods allocated to the Groups are also going to be scaled up by the interventions relating to the amendments"
Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President I would like to start with the last statement made by the Undersecretary when he referred in his speech to the concept that the patient must be taken over by the National Oncology Plan In our view the agenda that is being adopted today certainly goes in the right direction namely to remedy a serious deficiency in this National Plan as my previous colleagues have already said namely the lack of funds to take care of patients Certainly the approval of the agenda will not be enough to solve the problems because the government must clearly state how much and what resources it intends to allocate to make this National Oncology Plan effective The NAP we are talking about today is a good project but without time for implementation without planning and without resources it risks being a mere philosophical exercise completely insufficient for those citizens who at a delicate moment in their lives such as the fight against illness would need to know that the State is at their side On the other hand it will happen that the Regions will say that they have no own resources and the citizen will have to pay the care of his own pocket if he will have the money to be able to afford it As a political class we cannot afford to create distinctions between social classes we are called upon to intervene in order to make care a right of all and not a privilege for a few intimates We know that much more needs to be done in part we are intervening with the National Recovery and Resilience Plan as previous colleagues said which as we know affects health for almost EUR 18 billion Of these a substantial part will go to the restoration of a territorial health called proximity health with the creation of hospitals and homes of the community However what this National Recovery and Resilience Plan does not say is where we will find health medical nursing and social health workers from here to 2026 when the new structures will potentially be available This is the same principle as the National Oncology Plan many projects for the care of the sick but no clear indication of the resources allocated to the Plan itself So we risk having empty boxes and that is a shame because we cannot say that money is not there this time given the billions of euros that will come from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and also because the European plan to fight cancer to which the PON is required to align makes available EUR 4 billion But in the document sent to the Regions in recent days about which the Minister spoke a few minutes ago there is no clear indication of the resources necessary to cope with the lack of training and the shortage of staff in order to immediately activate the screenings in all the Regions including those for the taking charge of the subjects to high risk heir family as requested expressly by the National Observatory of the screenings At a time like this when the recovery of Covid 's infection seems to put the health of cancer patients at risk again it is necessary to give a signal of reversal of trend We cannot wait until 2026 with the full implementation of the National Plan to give operational responses we must act now in particular to plan on cancer screening Our hope is not to repeat the same mistake made with the National Plan which was approved in a hurry and which could be done better as far as health was concerned giving space not only to the establishment of structures but also to the formation of those who will have to manage such structures With regard to the plan we are debating today without these necessary elements particularly related to resources it will be completely useless and that is why it must be changed for the sake of those patients who struggle every day and who cannot rely only on their strength It is for all these reasons that the contribution of Brothers of Italy will not fail to this National Oncology Plan
"Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President I would like to say at once that I agree with my colleague in the Budget Committee of the League who preceded me when he said that this DEF is too optimistic and does not actually look at the picture we have at the moment a pandemic that is still going on and a war at the gates of Europe Why do I say that ma'am Because the data contained in this document of economy and finance deviate significantly from reality As well as saying the League and Brothers of Italy the Parliamentary Budget Office which reported in black and white that this DEF which is based on the data of mid-March does not take account of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine believing that it would end in a very short time The social partners in all the hearings we have held these days have also judged this document very far from reality and with far too optimistic data The estimates of this document speak of a GDP growth of 2.9 percent other institutions such as Confindustria which are certainly not of our political side even foresee much smaller figures which are close to 2 There is no reason to doubt this analysis and not to start to fear the spectre of recession We do not like to say we said it because it is not a good thing but our leader Giorgia Meloni always said that the growth of 2021 was the result of a physiological rebound clearly due to a comparison with the year 2020 which was the hardest of the pandemic that our country suffered Today we can say that we were right because in the first three months of 2022 Banca d'Italia tells us that we have already lost half a point of GDP a sign that the policies put in place in recent years by the Governments Count I Count II and Dragons have served little and have been in some way frustrated by everything that has happened not only at the time when the conflict between Russia and Ukraine broke out but also in the previous months I refer to the dear bills the dear energy and the dear raw materials Clearly they have also been frustrated by the consequences of the conflict that has just broken out You see President the starting point for this DEF was certainly not the best The government put him in black and white in particular through the hearing of Minister Franco a few days ago always on the DEF Therefore in the light of developments related to the ongoing conflict the growth prospects are very weak compared to what was said and thought at the beginning of 2022 Clearly this has been heavily affected as I said earlier by the rise in raw material prices which has led to inflation splashing at almost 7 and this figure could also worsen even further if Russia had to come to a total blockade of natural gas inflows So if we do not solve the issue of commodity increases which is the real problem that we have today in Italy and therefore consequently the increase in inflation the purchasing power of families will be reduced creating additional pockets of poverty So this is the real issue which has not yet been dealt with in the present document The reality in short is that the present document lacks a political vision and an overall view of the country system We are in a difficult socio- economic context in which the pandemic emergency as I said earlier has been accompanied by these stratospheric increases in fuel energy and raw materials as well as last but not least the ongoing conflict The Brothers of Italy Group therefore strongly calls for a change from the recent past We do not talk about the budgetary deviation because we know that it is a very delicate very particular and very difficult deviation because it will produce additional debt but today it is inevitable that there will be another one that can bring lifeblood to the system of Italian companies and families The 10 billion euros released from the document of economy and finance under consideration are already committed because five have already been committed with the decree law that we will approve tomorrow in this House and five will commit them with the next decree- law which will in some way be issued by the government in the coming days The difference is that we commit EUR 10 billion and Germany is allocating EUR 100 billion to give aid to its businesses so that is 10 of what Germany allocates It will therefore be necessary to release additional resources in deficit it is inevitable So in addition to the deviation we will need Europe 's intervention and this will be very important for us Mr President we cannot therefore reason as we are doing because on the one hand we are talking about expensive fuel with a cover until the first days of May and on the system of bills we have reasoned quarterly We need a much broader broader political vision because it must structurally attack the problems we have in Italy today We therefore need a new governance of Europe and we need to review the rules of the game the rules of engagement because they are too opaque and too complex It must therefore be confirmed because it is a very important fact the speech on the safeguard clauses and therefore on the Stability and Growth Pact which is now at its standstill in 2022 We must make an effort and the authority of President Draghi must also serve to enable Europe to make this choice and to extend this period of time because it will be very important Mr President this commitment to go beyond 2022 will not be enough either because we hope that we will arrive at 2026 in order to free up the budgets of the State administration but also of the local authorities As I said this is not all we need but we need to go beyond this objective because we need to reduce the levels of debt not through the increase in taxes as the government wants to do with regard to the reform of the land register or the cut in social expenditure but by maintaining control of public expenditure this will be a matter of fundamental importance I am referring to that famous spending review that has disappeared from the political agenda of successive governments in recent years to magically reappear in this DEF We therefore take note of this and hope that from now on this type of instrument will be central to the policies of the Government In addition to talking about this new governance of Europe there are the increases that weigh heavily on Italian families it is even thought that there is an average of 2,000 euros per family For Italian companies it is estimated an increase of 188 billion euros for the purchase of goods or services All this could lead to a further contraction of national GDP therefore the embargo on Russian gas would be a coup d' grace as I said for our economy and this DEF says it clearly the sanctions already imposed on Russia albeit just weigh heavily on our economy On this we ask President Draghi to exercise all the authority he enjoys in the European institutions to ask for new support that is not in debt but compensate for the losses that countries are suffering indirectly from sanctions In the same way the National Recovery and Resilience Plan must also be revised which must necessarily change its orientation and be directed towards a plan that allows Italy to acquire its energy independence I shall conclude Mr President because I have no other time but I would like to say to President Draghi in particular that the theme is not to choose between peace and the heated air conditioners and from which we would have obviously expected other kinds of considerations the theme is to give the Italians the opportunity to choose between a government that lives in the day and one that has a political vision of the future of this country For this reason Brothers of Italy will abstain on the motion for a resolution on the deviation and instead vote against motion for a resolution No 1 on which the Government has expressed a favourable opinion"
"Mr President representative of the Government ladies and gentlemen this aid decree is the ninth measure providing for measures to deal with expensive energy and expensive fuel To date overall more than 33 billion are allocated These in summary are the measures introduced by the measure For companies tax credits for electricity and gas consumption expenditure in the second quarter are increased there are additional extraordinary contributions to local authorities to cope with increases in bills 150 million to municipalities 30 million to provinces Against the expensive fuel for the hauliers there is the tax credit of 28 percent of the expenses incurred for the purchase of diesel but carried out only in the first trimester of 2022 Against the spiral of inflation there is the recognition of the 200 euro bonus to an audience of 31 million Italians Then there is the extension to the third trimester of the zeroing of the system charges in the electric bills for all the utilities the reduction of the system charges in the gas bills the VAT facilitated to 5 for the consumption of natural gas for civil and industrial uses Also in the third quarter there is the extension of the social energy bonus to families in economic difficulties and for citizens in serious health conditions we speak of 5.2 million subjects For access to this bonus wanted by the League which has made it a battle of equity and justice the retroactivity has been added with the compensation of the automatism after that we had denounced how the automatism itself at the beginning was valid only for the perceptors of the income of citizenship while for the remaining families in economic difficulty many of which unaware of the right of the benefit and that in these months they have continued to pay very salty bills ran the obligation to present to the Municipality the unique substitute documentation an unacceptable discrimination that we have now removed for the benefit of millions of families Other significant measures of the decree law are the commissioners for the two floating regasifiers of Piombino and Ravenna the ulterior simplifications for renewables and energy communities something on the superbonus and the cession of the credits 3 billion against the dear materials for the public works there is also the management of the waste in Rome with the thermovaluer that we trust is realized as soon as possible to remove the shame in which the capital has been pouring in for too many years Not everything however is smooth with the rewording by the Executive of a parliamentary amendment to the House the de minimis for the recognition of tax credits for gas and electricity purchases has been incredibly introduced it is a rule that has left us unhindered for approximation and that has thrown companies into panic It is as unacceptable as the government while with one hand it provides the tax credit to give a breath of oxygen to companies with the other instead they tell me to the Department of European policies it intends to compress if not even zero these same benefits turning its back on the enterprises moreover in this period of dear energy in which Europe has also expanded the links in the matter of state aid The constraint therefore is absolutely to be removed because the de minimis provides for the maximum amount of aid that can be obtained at EUR 200,000 but on a three year basis and for all companies belonging to the same group and the figure of EUR 200,000 is currently absolutely inadequate for the purpose of supporting companies The commitment of the MEF even at the urging of Minister Giorgetti to carry out the corrective intervention after the request of the League is important but the time to implement it is limited If the distortion is not removed by July 16 the day after tomorrow the companies already heavily affected by the expensive bills will not be able to compensate for the tax credits accrued in the second quarter so they would suffer further financial difficulties not counting then the problem of the credits already used in contrast to the norm that has occurred Another absurdity that has happened is that while the Government has extended for another three months this on 30 June therefore until September the VAT facilitated to 5 for the consumption of natural gas for civil and industrial uses measures in force since October 2021 here comes to surprise the Agency of revenues which in fact with its own interpretation wants to put its hands in the pockets of the Italians asking for the return of part of the facility Last July 7 the Agency ruled going in our opinion against a clear principle of Union matrix that the reduced rate of 5 applies only to the raw material commodity but cannot extend to the ancillary services or the fixed quota of the tariff in fact requiring the sales operators who are now in total panic to correct all invoices issued so far since October 2021 charging the retroactive tax to users Who now tells the Italians that they will have to pay 17 of VAT on more than 50 of the bill All this moreover with retroactive effect from 1 October On this point it is absolutely necessary for the Director of the Agency to take the matter into his own hands and to revoke the interpretation of his offices On the front of energy security and relief from Russian gas the Government and Minister Cingolani are doing so much but on the front of the dear energy in spite of geopolitical events the instability of the markets the difficulty of supplying gas in these days we also have the stop of supplying Russian gas through the Nordstream Mr President I can not move forward I ask you whether you can take a break and resume my speech later PRESIDENT The debate is closed Of course"
Mr President thank you for the opportunity I 'll try again I said that on the front of energy security and relief from Russian gas the Government and Minister Cingolani are doing so much but on the front of the dear energy in the face of geopolitical events the instability of the markets and the difficulty of supplying gas in these days we also have the stop of supplying Russian gas through the North Stream and the abnormity and the unpredictability of gas price levels the situation is worrying and I fear that for autumn it will become dramatic The industry can't stand it anymore and above all it has no certainty Now the unknowns on the supplyings multiply For a few days some sellers have already informed their customers that given the price levels of electricity from 1 January 2023 they will terminate the supply contracts Added to this is the growing difficulty of large companies in defining gas supply contracts for the next thermal year since the main operators having difficulty finding it on the wholesale markets do not undertake to guarantee the contractual delivery of the gas On the basis of this some business associations I think of Assakarta have launched the alarm for the imminent closure of production facilities a drama for the economy and for employment I shall conclude by saying that we need much more for our energy Premier Draghi announced by the end of the month a new intervention with several billions Well the League is asking for it to be powerful financed also through a budgetary deviation also because it will have to counter the price levels of gas and electricity continuously rising in these days are nine times those of the pre-Covid years Today the single national price of electricity PUN is 446 euros per megawattora and 180 that of gas We are practically at double levels compared to the average prices of the first half of 2022 the quadruple compared to the average of 2021 Therefore if we do not intervene decisively we will have unsustainable costs for families and businesses even in the protected sector affecting the maintenance of the system The League as indicated in the motion that will be discussed next Thursday calls for the following measures to be extended and strengthened throughout the third quarter tax credits for energy purchases by companies obviously without the de minimis regime the cut in excise duties on fuels remember that ends on 2 August the zeroing of excise duties and the cut in VAT on gas for motor vehicles which has alarming prices which put at risk the existence of a supply chain the tax credit for the purchase of diesel and petrol for fishing agriculture and road haulage we also ask that new contributions be made for the municipalities which are in short supply and that at last 5 VAT be provided for indirect gas Premier Draghi is right to insist in Europe on the roof at the price of gas however if he ever succeeds in obtaining it from Europe it will be months longer and in the meantime we increase national gas production without delay to reduce our energy dependence including by amending the Plan for the sustainable energy transition of the suitable areas Pitesai Finally it is true that the superbonus is expensive It was inevitable that it would end this way too ambitious and not sustainable but today there are companies technicians and families that have started work and are stalled They 've been in debt mortgaged property and they 're failing I turn to Prime Minister Draghi and Minister Franco to give legal certainty we must give them a way out too
"Mr President representative of the Government ladies and gentlemen this price cutting decree has been the sixth measure since the second half of last year which provides for measures to deal with expensive energy and expensive fuel To date the total amount is 22 billion of which more than 5 in this decree Compared to expensive energy these are in summary the measures introduced in the measure First of all there is the reduction until next July 8 of excise duties on petrol diesel and LPG a measure that makes us particularly satisfied since the League with a motion at the beginning of March was the first political force to urge the Government to introduce it Contributions were then raised in the form of a tax credit for energy and gas companies for the increased costs incurred in the purchase and use of electricity and gas For the first time the tax credit for higher electricity and gas costs by small and medium sized enterprises was introduced Also important is the tax credit of 20 for the purchase of fuels in the first quarter 2022 for the exercise of agricultural and fishing activities For the period April 1st to December 31st the value of the ISEE was extended to 12,000 for access to the social bonus water and light gas from families that I remember has been enhanced since October 2021 The audience of the beneficiary nuclei thus rose from 4 to 5.2 million On the social bonus and energy poverty I remember that the League denounced that automatism was valid only for the recipients of citizenship income while for the remaining families in economic difficulty many of them unaware of the right to benefit and that in these months they have continued to pay very salty bills ran the obligation to submit to the municipality the unique replacement documentation with the indication of their incomes and assets with the addition to benefit of the bonus only from that moment on It is an unacceptable discrimination which thanks to Minister Giorgetti we have removed with the so called aid decree with which in addition to automation retroactivity with compensation for the social bonus has been introduced for all We have won a battle of justice and equity During the conversion unfortunately once again the financial space available to Parliament has been almost null and void Noteworthy however is the confluence of Decree Law No. 38 of 2 May 2022 which led to the extension of the reduction of the excise duty on petrol and LPG to 8 July but for the first time it also introduced measures in favour of the gas supply chain for automotive literally on the knees for months Well not only the zeroing until 8 July of the excise duty of the gas for automotive but above all after the League from October 2021 had repeatedly requested it with several amendments also the application of the VAT facilitated to 5 of the gas for automotive like what is being done for gas for civil and industrial uses since October With the same determination we will continue to insist that the 5 reduced VAT can once and for all also apply to district heating services and energy service contracts where gas is indirectly used for house heating Always in good conversion the amendment of the League that allows in the agricultural field to take advantage of the full use of the technical capacity of the installed plants of production of electricity from biogas Before concluding I have to make two comments the first concerns the introduction of the tax on extra-profits made by companies engaged in energy activities Of course with high energy there are subjects that have been extravagant for months Therefore a rule that provided for an extraordinary solidarity levy served and indeed was necessary but it had to be fair and just as is not the article 37 of the decree law that instead has many distorting elements that risk to severely penalize some enterprises The rule does not take into account the excise duty paid the extraordinary transactions the financial derivatives to cover the risk where instead the banks are the protagonists hitting only the physical contracts The League with all rejected amendments not only asked to remove these distortions but also proposed to widen the audience of those who have to pay the tax also to banks and financial intermediaries operating in the energy sector with financial contracts and derivatives Incomprehensiblely however this proposal has also been rejected heard out of honesty a serious mistake because the approval of our amendment would have guaranteed not only greater revenues to the State and consequently the distribution of profits to millions of Italians but also to cover the burdens to remove distorting effects contained in the penal law for several companies that will probably be led to recourse to the Consulta The question arises spontaneously was the involvement of banks costly for the State we say absolutely no or for Draghi We hope that with the so called aid decree where the tax has been announced to rise from 10 to 25 it will run for cover As far as the second and last reflection is concerned all the measures launched so far zero charges for electricity and gas bills reduced VAT at 5 for gas social bonuses tax credit for companies for electricity and gas consumption and finally the reduction of fuel excise duties are covered up to the second quarter and therefore until 30 June 8 July for the reduction of excise duty The so called aid decree does not extend these measures from the advance notice and is a major problem Since the dear energy aggravated by the Ukrainian Russian war has structural characteristics and continues incessantly with prohibitive prices the government will play force within a month will necessarily have to introduce another substantial measure that extends to the third trimester the measure to protect citizens of the enterprises and the economic recovery penalty the crisis It 's gonna take several billions It is likely that we will need a new set of debt interventions of course also in the Community where Europe is called upon to play its part If Brussels with the recovery fund has allowed debt to be paid for the ecological and digital transition there is no reason to avoid this tragedy that has been affecting families and entire production sectors in crisis for almost a year"
Minister thank you for informing this House of the measures that the Government is about to take to secure our energy system more and more I want to start with the data too In 2001 Italy extracted 15 billion cubic metres of gas from national deposits representing 15 of total consumption which was then 71 billion We imported 20 billion cubic metres from Russia 28 percent of the total Twenty years later in 2021 last year zero kilometre gas extracted was reduced to 3.3 billion equivalent to just 4 of total consumption which in the meantime rose to 76 billion and last year we imported 29 billion cubic metres from Russia equivalent to 38 percent of the total These figures summarize the failure of years of Italian and European energy policy set at the bottom of everything No to nuclear was not enough no to coal no to drills no to TAP no to regasifiers no even to biomass and geothermal energy Politics in our country imbued with environmental ideologism has ignored the fundamentals Irregularly the foreign energy dependence of gas has risen in 20 years from 85 to 96 percent Instead of diversifying supplies we did the opposite by increasing imports of Russian gas Moreover in Italy as in Europe the advocates of green deal of push decarbonisation of Net Zero in 2050 have prevailed which has contributed with the ETS to raise energy prices However supporters of the ecological transition without fossils make no distinction between fuel oil coal and gas which is the least polluting of fossils And so for gas infrastructure for several years investments extractions and regasifiers have been blocked Until a few months ago even in the Senate by various political forces gas was considered absolute evil while it is exercising its strategic role of accompanying the ecological transition Yet who would go to fight the expensive bills someone had feared it in due time the League at the Copasir already in September 2020 asking and obtaining a cognitive survey on the energy system always the League during the preparation of the general lines of the PNRR I quote our comments as reflected in the final report on the PNRR proposal approved here in the Senate in March 2021 In a passage in relation to the development of renewables the Government was invited to take into account the following objectives to reduce the dependence of the country in terms of both energy and raw materials and diversify the sources of supply to reduce the cost of electricity and gas bills to strengthen the security and resilience of the country 's energy system with regard to plants networks and strategic reserves Evidently hairs fell into the void Now instead they all speak of energy autonomy of diversification of supplies after the dear energy has fallen like a tsunami that is overwhelming everyone and that risks to frustrate the economic recovery Compared to last year we are at crazy prices of electricity and gas which have increased six times The high level of energy which increasingly has structural characteristics is a phenomenon mainly European but Italy suffers much more because it pays for the questionable choices I have said and for a too small energy mix I remember that last year alone the average price of electricity in Italy was 30 higher than in Germany and 15 higher than in France We acknowledge the government 's intervention in the last few months with five measures allocating more than 17 billion to contain electricity and gas bills until the second quarter of this year But the measures are not enough the situation is unsustainable for many companies Much more needs to be done a budgetary deviation is now inevitable Meanwhile Europe after the Russian Ukrainian war to face the dear energy has updated the toolbox after the half empty one in October The Commission presented the RePower EU Some proposals are appreciable others do not convince us but better late than never Gas and nuclear integration into taxonomy is fine recognition of the role of gas in the transition is good We are now no longer talking about freeing Europe from gas but about freeing it from Russian gas It is the progress of pragmatism Care must be taken to accelerate too much the transition to clean energy with the prevalence of renewables photovoltaics and wind are not programmable because they produce only when there are sun and wind and represent a strong limit to the safety of the energy system and storage systems are far from being technologically ready developed and distributed on the territory I am concerned about the stability of the energy system in Sardinia where the Capacity market auction was assigned to a 500 megawatt accumulator The Government 's recipes for the gas emergency are positive both measures to increase short term security and measures to reduce and eliminate the dependence of imports from Russia as you indicated earlier Minister it contrasts speculation and pursues the withdrawal if there are extra profits of gas as already done for plants with renewable sources As a League always attentive to the issues of dear energy or the security of the energy system we ask you and the Government to do more I reiterate the need for a significant budgetary deviation to contain the dear bills It is not enough to extract more gas from authorized deposits alone We know that there is the Pitesai with too many constraints but we cannot continue to give our gas to Croatia or Greece We need to look for new gas fields at zero kilometres to increase our energy autonomy including to protect the environment since with the import one we emit many more climatic substances For the diversification of the supplyings we resume the plan of the EastMed gas pipeline able to bring to Italy natural gas from Israel We extend the energy mix to all renewables It is necessary to develop not only photovoltaic and wind they have strong limits of programmability but also geothermal biomass and especially hydropower which needs investment through demonstrations of public interest and not mere extensions that would for the third time be pallinated by the Constitutional Court We need more technological autonomy let us not close to the development of the latest generation of clean and safe nuclear power We must open a serious scientific and unprejudiced debate on the energy of the atom and reopen research on fission If by 2050 we want to seriously combat climate change and reduce CO2 emissions to zero if we want to respond to the growing demand for electrification if we have to deliver energy in a stable and continuous way and if we want to produce hydrogen at very low emissions to overcome gas know ladies and gentlemen that nuclear technology is the only one that will allow it Now we must also face the expensive fuels dear Minister As if the dear energy were not enough the crisis in Ukraine is exacerbating the expensive fuels that represent a further energy shock The critical situation on the international commodity markets has driven the prices of petrol and diesel which for several days have exceeded EUR 2.3 per litre With these unsustainable prices the field of road haulage is put in crisis it determines the block of numerous productive activities it will determine an ulterior increase of the prices of detail for many products of wide consumption creating a heavy damage to the economy of our Country There is no doubt that these prices are leading to a significant outcast for the state 's coffers estimated this year at over EUR 2 billion At this point it becomes necessary and the League has filed a motion to this effect for the Government to act as done by other European countries such as France Ireland Belgium and Poland who have deliberated measures to return tax extra-introductions bringing immediate benefits to citizenship We strongly call here in Parliament and in hundreds of municipal councils to intervene with an urgent temporary measure for the non-application of excise duty perhaps according to the so called mobile excise duty criterion or by introducing a reduced rate of VAT on fuel Minister Cingolani this action which does not need economic cover is necessary for the maintenance of the economic system of the entire country implement it Minister accept these proposals and the full willingness of the League to cooperate Good job
"Mr President Under Secretary of State ladies and gentlemen I am speaking on articles relating to the concessions for the distribution of natural gas and those of major hydroelectric origin On the first dealt with in Article 4 of the basic text which has now become Article 6 after the move to the Commission the League expresses partial satisfaction The inclusion of this topic in the draft competition law had and has the objective to overcome the stalemate in the races for the reassignment of the concessions that lasts for more than ten years during which by the 177 minimum territorial areas very few competitive procedures have been carried out also because of many expensive and very long disputes This is a stalemate which is effectively precluded from the country 20 billion investments in the sector which are estimated over 12 years of the duration of the concessions The basic text which aimed to relaunch investments in the sector by accelerating the tendering procedures and which already positively in case the Municipality intends to sell networks and plants allowed to properly exploit the gas distribution networks owned according to the residual industrial value also thanks to the contributions of the League has been little improved However more had to be done for example as we have proposed to encourage and support the aggregations between companies in order to give greater competitive impetus in the competitions thus reducing the current fragmentation that now records more than 200 operators of which more than half that together cover only 20 of the market or it should have allowed the Municipality to alienate its own networks and distribution facilities even before the contract of reliance of the distribution service This is to better capitalise on its assets which on the other hand run the risk of not being properly valued during the competition Moreover it should have been foreseen that the contracting authority should appoint the tendering commissioners by extracting them from a list of experts of proven experience defined by the Ministry of the ecological transition I hope that I am wrong but I fear that by approving this text we have not effectively amended the rules and therefore we have not created the conditions to promote the development of competition and to remove the many regulatory and administrative obstacles that do not favour the conduct of competitions On the concessions of large hydroelectric derivations now dealt with in article 7 the League expresses great satisfaction instead With the approval of the amendment in the Commission after the majority agreement the basic text which presented several critical issues that would worsen the current national legislation has been positively amended In practice both the regionalisation of the sector and the procedures for renewing expired concessions are confirmed These therefore will be carried out by the Regions in compliance with the criteria and guidelines already established by the national norm strongly desired by the League and introduced in the phase of conversion of Decree Law 14 December 2018 n. 135 which I remember last year allowed to archive the European infringement procedure opened against Italy We are very happy because in these two years the norm has resisted last also during the negotiation on the plan of competition law several attempts of some political forces that have tried to dismantle the regionalization of the field and therefore demolish one of the first concrete forms of autonomy of the Regions or to propose the extension of the concessions for these the reasons avoiding the arrival of foreign operators forgetting that already now the majority of the operators of the hydroelectric are participated from foreign investors and guarantee the safety of the energy system and the national autonomy energy These are two aspects that are certainly important ignored for many years and discovered only in the last few weeks but that we are convinced will be pursued precisely with the renewals of the concessions Recentralising the management and extending the concessions in fact would have represented a tight entry against the regions that have already legislated or are providing it it would have represented a huge gift to the outgoing dealers who would have continued to make so many profits confirming yet another wrong to the mountainous territories exploited without any return with erial damages to be borne by Regions Provinces Municipalities and mountain communities of more than 10 billion euros it would have violated the conditions laid down by the European Commission which withdrew the infringement procedure provided that it proceeded with the procedures of reassignment of the concessions it would have determined a third rejection of the extension by the Constitutional Court after the 2008 judgment on the ten year extension previewed by the law 23 December 2005 n. 266 and the second judgment of 2011 on the extension of five years previewed by Decree Law 31 May 2010 n. 78 This is the victory of common sense With the completion of the competitive procedures of reassignment of the expired concessions wet goods i.e. the properties of dams gripping works canals tunnels and forced conducts will be relegated to the regions and appropriate compensation will be paid to the affected mountain territories through appropriate water charges free electricity environmental and territorial compensation Finally after more than twenty years of stalemate a season of great investments will start to modernise and relaunch the hydroelectric a strategic programmable renewable energy asset for our country The investments will allow to realize actions of improvement of power generation and efficiency of the plants in order to produce more renewable electricity and therefore to contribute to reach the target increasingly challenging of energy from renewable sources and also to pursue the reduction of our energy dependence The investments will allow to realize actions of technological and structural improvement necessary in order to improve the efficiency of the goods on dams and conducted in order to assure the better conservation of the volumes of invaded to upgrade the systems of pumping and therefore to increase the ability to accumulation in order to greater safety of the energy system The investments will enable the improvement and environmental improvement of the catchment area concerned by the installation under concession as well as the coordinated management of water resources in order to exercise control over various aspects such as the management of lake levels and the need for irrigation The investments will allow to give an opportunity to the Italian supply chain known in the world made of excellence both with regard to machinery and technology and with regard to companies This is not only one of the first forms of regional autonomy but I stress this again the renewal of hydroelectric concessions with investments in new or existing plants is a driver necessary to aim for zero CO2 emissions in 2050 The International Energy Agency is also said to be in its latest report entirely dedicated to this renewable source According to the director of the Agency Fatih Birol hydropower is the forgotten giant of the energy transition because investments have concentrated and badly are on wind and photovoltaic On the other hand the hydroelectric basins offer several advantages in addition to producing renewable electricity thanks to pumping they act as storage systems they can provide flexibility services to the electricity grid and thus help to compensate for the unprogrammable fluctuations I repeat of wind and photovoltaic parks In the world hydropower with a committed power of 1,330 gigawatts and a production of electricity of almost 4,500 terawattora per year is the largest source of clean energy and produces more than all other renewable sources put together wind solar photovoltaic bioenergy and geothermal In Italy the hydroelectric park consisting of more than 4,500 plants for a power of about 23 gigawatts of which 4 gigawatts of pumping and that in 2021 has supplied a production of 45 terawattora almost 16 percent of national electricity equivalent to 40 percent of all RES thanks to this norm is going to relive a new great season I would like to end by thanking Mr Garofoli Mr Pichetto Fratin Mr Bini Mr Girotto and above all the two rapporteurs Mr Collina and Mr Ripamonti for their great commitment in almost three months of activity"
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to thank Minister Cingolani for his comprehensive report in anticipation of the forthcoming meeting of the Energy and Environment Ministers of the G7 countries convened to establish a global alliance on ecological transition and sustainability We understand that the German Presidency intends to promote further emission reduction commitments compared to those already adopted at Cop26 in Glasgow Well if the anticipations are these there is a little to worry about especially if we are the only EU countries that are responsible for only 9 of CO2 emissions while China and India continue to be the major polluters I say this because we are well aware of the failure of years of the Italian European energy policy based on hyper challenging objectives and on the no to almost everything no to nuclear no to regasifiers no to drills no to TAP no to the thermo-energy plant in Rome In Europe and Italy in recent years for example we have disinvested in oil and gas thinking of protecting the environment instead we have made a disaster Gas consumption has remained similar prices have skyrocketed due to the surge in global gas demand and we pollute more because by importing gas more emissions are created Thus natural gas has overpowered its strategic role as a source of energy and as an accompaniment to the ecological transition and is sold dearly Compared to the pre-Covid period we are at crazy levels of gas prices and consequently electricity they have increased five times The high level of energy which increasingly has structural characteristics is a European phenomenon in particular But Italy suffers much more because it pays for the questionable choices I said above it pays for inefficiencies never resolved and for an energy mix too reduced High energy is also slowing down the ecological transition more coal is burning in Europe especially in Germany which would like to morale about emissions and not about nuclear power Against expensive energy we acknowledge that the Government has intervened in recent months with seven measures allocating a total of about 24 billion to contain bills of light and gas and expensive fuels Measures after the Russian Ukrainian crisis for gas emergency and measures to increase short term security and to reduce and eliminate the dependence of imports from Russia are also positive It wo n't be easy anyway I come to Europe and to the very recent Repower EU plan After the successful incorporation of gas and nuclear into taxonomy at the end of last year pragmatism in Brussels has made some progress In fact the role of gas in the transition has begun to be recognised Now we are no longer talking about freeing Europe from gas considered for too long the dark evil because it is a fossil but about freeing it from Russian gas After the Russian Ukrainian war in order to cope with expensive energy and to free itself from coal oil and Russian gas Brussels updated the toolbox after the half empty one in October and so the Commission last week presented the Repower EU plan The new objectives which have been raised compared to those already challenging and which are not acceptable to us in the Fit for 55 package leave us very perplexed We take note of the need to prolong the lives of coal and nuclear power stations and environmentalists will take it into account Illusory is instead the doubling of the objective of green hydrogen from 5 to 10 million tons per year There 's nothing yet There is no hydrogen market and above all there is little renewable electricity to produce it Too much emphasis then on the new 2030 energy efficiency target raised from 9 to 13 percent Question who pays the investment on existing buildings If we were to do it only with the superbonus the state would go bankrupt There is still too much emphasis on renewable energy with a target raised from 40 to 45 on final energy consumption We reiterate that the development of photovoltaics and wind they are not programmable and represent a strong limit to the security of the energy system will not be without the adaptation of the Terna transmission network and the development of the storage capacity which is still not available at an industrial level for which research is needed to develop technologies that do not make use of lithium in order to avoid tying us even more hands and feet to China With this in mind it is difficult to combine three energy policy objectives such as reducing emissions ensuring security of gas supply from other suppliers and containing energy prices There is a need for substantial investment A total economic support of 220 billion by 2027 is being envisaged in Europe with a loan mechanism such as the one created in response to Covid but how much would it be worth to Italy We know that Italy like Romania and Greece is among the countries that have already drawn on all the funds available for the National Recovery and Resilience Plan so we risk remaining dry Minister as a League always attentive to energy issues we make proposals that we ask you and the Government to take into account First of all it should be remembered that all the measures taken so far to contain expensive energy and expensive fuels are covered until 30 June on 8 July the excise duty on fuels and this is a big problem because the dear energy aggravated by the war has structural characteristics the Government will have to take another full measure within a month that will extend to the third quarter the measures to protect citizens businesses and economic recovery in the penalty of the crisis It will take several billions and it is likely that we will need a new intervention in debt a budgetary deviation that is a Community intervention in which Europe is called to play its part As far as gas is concerned all supply diversification measures are good for freeing themselves from Russia But above all we must reduce our high energy dependence also because Algeria Mozambique Angola Congo and Qatar themselves are not champions of democracy It is therefore okay to produce more biomethane but above all it is necessary to increase national gas production exploiting our deposits which Minister means more investment more employment more royalty for the territories and more environmental protection On sustainable mobility and decarbonisation of transport to combat climate change the enemy is CO2 not internal combustion cars The G7's objective of having all the new electric vehicles cars and zero emissions vans within the next decade is profoundly wrong Minister enforce the principle of technological neutrality All technologies contributing to decarbonisation including Euro 6 and Euro 7 must be supported We continue to develop biofuels synthetic fuels and LNG liquefied natural gas supply chains for heavy transport in addition to biomethane and hydrogen It is not only a question of protecting our automotive industry but also of protecting the environment as there is not all green energy Where is the charging infrastructure The electricity grid however cannot be easily adapted and then there will be no batteries or there will be another dependence on Asia with enormous geopolitical risks The circular economy must be closed in accordance with the principle of self sufficiency and territorial proximity Next then with the thermo-energy plant in Rome and with similar plants that are necessary The previous ones are measures for the short and medium term while we must have a view on the medium to long term So if we have to decarbonise in 2050 respond to the growing demand for electricity if we have to deliver energy continuously if we have to produce very low emission hydrogen considered a central element to overcome gas and if we have to reduce energy dependence we cannot avoid the development of the latest generation of clean and safe nuclear power Minister Cingolani and I have concluded we believe that these proposals of ours are important for the maintenance of the economic system of our country in a period of deep crisis and international instability Evaluate and accept the full availability of our collaboration Good job
Mr President ladies and gentlemen the report is the result of intensive work by the Copasir during 2021 thanks to the relations between the Committee and the Republic 's Security Information System and the close hearings with all the ministers of the Interministerial Security Committee of the Republic CISR the Delegated Authority represented here by Prefect Gabrielli and the directors of the Security Information Department DIS the Information and External Security Agency AISE the Internal Security and Information Agency AISI and the new Cybersecurity Agency an intensive and articulated activity has developed The issues dealt with in the report show that the perimeter of control entrusted to the Copasir invests an increasingly extensive and neuralgic area which has what purpose the national security in its different declinations that cannot be considered static and predefined One of the main focus of Copasir 's activity as in previous years was the theme of 5G the single network and the national cloud which our country is still lacking There is an awareness that the strategic and now indispensable role of the most advanced telecommunications networks as well as of the new generation of infrastructures demands a constant defence against pitfalls and threats that risk exposing these garrisons to an accentuated vulnerability This awareness combined with the Committee 's constant drive led in June last year although with many years of delay to the establishment of the National Cybersecurity Agency which is allowing our country to reduce a gap that is no longer sustainable in this sensitive sector a key agency also to respond to the hybrid character of the Russian war against Ukraine Moreover the extremely invasive extent of cyber threats the plurality of possible sources of aggression and undue interference the same heterogeneity of attacks and possible incidents are all together factors of extreme concern which require a protective and maximum resilience framework which requires continual adaptation and refinement To this end we recall that 95 of Italian public administrations do not yet have the necessary and adequate tools to protect their data Thousands of public administrations still have Russian Kaspersky as antivirus There is therefore a need to use European technology to build a national strategic hub which will host country 's strategic digital data and services together with the National Cybersecurity Agency in order to ensure maximum protection of national security The government 's exercise of special powers the so called golden power has also been systematically monitored in the course of the Committee 's work which has identified its limitations as well as its scope for improvement The already fragile economic situation has also been affected by the explosion of the pandemic with a general reduction in productivity and competitiveness and a devaluation of strategic industrial assets increasingly exposed to foreign aims It has been found that in a more dangerous condition are the small Italian multinationals that develop artificial intelligence robotics packaging machine tools defense and biotechnology Hence the need for a geopolitical protection and so called special powers or golden power a legal instrument for the protection of economic financial industrial and scientific interests at the disposal of the Italian Government With this discipline modified during the pandemic to increase the role of intelligence services our country builds or wants to do so its identity presenting before the global world its priorities in order to ensure the maintenance of a leading role for Italy and its degree of overall competitiveness within the global area It is in this sense that a modern and truly incisive vision of the culture of security can no longer ignore the so called economic intelligence as they have been doing for several years in France the defence of the independence of the state and the national territory requires that the perimeter of security includes the protection of strategic economic interests and crucial for the strength of our country The Committee has also launched a survey on aerospace as a new frontier of geopolitical competition deepening the current process of liberalisation affecting the space perimeter and its consequences starting from the adaptation of international regulations in the field and the increasing protagonism of private actors alongside state actors among which are powers particularly active in the exploitation of space domain A further survey of the prospects for developing the common European defence and cooperation between intelligence services is also under way The Committee will come to Brussels in two weeks time One of the issues to consider is the strengthening of the national defence industry as a strategic asset for the country system both because it provides capacities and means indispensable for the protection of national interest and because it is a resource to increase the geopolitical influence of Italy I think it is a good thing that in the light of the Russian Ukrainian war there have been more arguments about the possibility of devoting more resources to defence in the state budget Of course the Copasir could not fail to dedicate a chapter to the country 's energy system Already in the second half of 2020 a year before the emergence of expensive energy the second half of last year it was clear to the members of the Committee the need to carry out a cognitive survey to analyze the vulnerability of our system characterized by a high dependence on energy and raw materials from abroad also due to the unfortunate and progressive reduction of the exploitation of national geo-resources Our dependence on gas from abroad last year was 96 percent due to the lack of diversification of supplies In fact we import 40 of gas from Russia We are critical in the safety of the energy system and strategic reserves a high cost of electricity and gas bills historically higher than European partners and risks of impact of the ecological transition Meanwhile since the second half of 2021 but for those who speak to you it was expected the perfect storm with the dear energy that has touched Europe in particular Italy with more structural characteristics than cyclical expensive energy then aggravated with the Russian Ukrainian crisis to become the worst energy crisis in recent decades also in the face of the concrete danger that Russia can exploit this issue to exert pressure on the EU using gas supplies as an instrument of tension and asymmetrical war With regard to energy security in the current phase of ecological transition the information procedure has shown that the complex changes caused by climate change and the fight against global warming with the aim of achieving so called climate neutrality by 2050 have given impetus to a phase of energy transition full of opportunities but also of serious risks which are much greater and diversified than those related to the renewal of hydroelectric concessions which I see emphasized by many colleagues as the only problem of our energy system With this in mind the need for a strengthening of so called economic intelligence in support of such a decisive sector is further stressed through an approach not only more defensive and protective but also proactive and proactive Mr President I would ask you to be able to hand over the final part of the speech to the record and I come to the conclusion that the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group thanks President Urso who is the rapporteur today and above all expresses his sincere thanks to the women and men of the agencies in our intelligence sector
Arrigoni L SP PSd Az Mr President the result of the unblocking of the sale of credits is certainly not due to a single political force which has speculated on the issue of superbonus but it is the result of various political forces and in particular of the League thanks to the mediation work done by the Undersecretary Freni If it had not been for the Undersecretary Freni there would have been the red light in front not only of this amendment but also of the amendment of the League An important result has therefore been achieved allowing thousands of businesses hundreds of thousands of homeowners and tens of thousands of professionals to get out of the ford It is regrettable that within the framework of the League 's amendments package on the superbonus the proposed removal of the SAL at 30 has been rejected planned in September which would allow those who left with work on single family villas to get out of the swamp where great responsibility certainly has the Movimento 5 Stars which on the superbonus has deceived thousands and thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of citizens The League therefore strongly votes for this amendment which is certainly due also to the amendment of the League of Italy alive and of Forza Italia
Mr President ladies and gentlemen of the Government colleagues from the beginning of the parliamentary term have established the practice of defining measures with a name as well as a technical designation Often in the past the pompous name is not matched by an equally important content In my opinion however this is not the case Defining this as an aid decree is entirely relevant because it contains measures of 14 billion measures in favour of our production system in favour of our population and in favour of all categories in difficulty It is no coincidence that as a first reference to content I want to talk about the fund for companies in crisis For two years there has been talk of crisis crisis for the Covid 19 crisis for the supply chain crisis of the caused by the war in Ukraine crisis caused by the dear of raw materials crisis caused by the dear oil It has been two years practically that we have been facing one crisis after another Therefore taking measures in favour of businesses could be crucial to their survival Evidence however that it is not a question of rain measures of one off aids aimed only at giving a small temporary limited comfort To expect an increase in the tax credit for the purchase of structural goods means to look to the future it means to push the enterprise and investments it means to push our productive activities to their improvement it means precisely to focus on the future to the future and not to the present survival In this respect measures for drivers also apply We know that inflation in Europe is not driven by such flourishing economic growth as in the United States for example in recent years Inflation in Europe is determined almost exclusively by expensive raw materials primarily oil and gas then aggravated by the fact that the exchange rate ratio between the euro and the dollar has gone against us This is because paying for raw materials in dollars it is clear that if the dollar strengthens against the euro raw materials cost more despite a fall in the nominal price I would like to make this observation because many people are surprised that with oil at 100 dollars per barrel fuels are still close to two euros But if when it was 110 the exchange rate was 1 to 10 and now it 's 100 but the exchange rate is 1 it 's obvious that the price is the same it 's the exact same price we paid before Therefore to implement measures in favour of road hauliers which in Italy are fundamental for our production system as practically all transport takes place on rubber means supporting not only that production category but also all Italians because in this way we help to reduce the final cost for consumers It has already been said about the 200 euro bonus which is not high of course but it is a help It has already been said of the extension granted to those who are doing the work for the superbonus for the bonus 110 percent On this point however I would like to dwell because on the occasion of my explanation of vote in this House on the conversion of the decree law bills I had complained that I could not intervene in the improvement of that provision highlighting the need to derogate also from Article 136 of the Single Construction Act in addition to the derogation contained in that decree from Article 142 The derogation from Article 136 is also contained in this measure and this is a personal satisfaction for me It is in fact a useful measure for the whole of the national territory but indispensable for the Commons earthquakeed which are very often found to fall within the limits of Article 136 and not in those of Article 142 Therefore in addition to intervening with economic support the Government also intervenes in this measure with measures in favour of what has already been done to simplify procedures to eliminate problems to give opportunities to those in a situation of difficulty In this respect the measure in favour of the municipalities also applies As a former mayor I am obviously very sensitive to everything that is in favour of the municipalities both because I believe that the mayors especially of the small municipalities are in trenches and therefore must give concrete and immediate answers citizens both because already before all these emergencies it was difficult to give these answers Now that public lighting prices have quadrupled now that heating prices have increased the municipalities obviously have many public buildings to heat now that the revenues for these municipalities have decreased it is clear that taking these measures means allowing these administrators to continue with their voluntary activity Being mayor in a small municipality I guarantee you that it is volunteering in its utmost essence
Crazy people L SP PSd Az Mr President members of the Government ladies and gentlemen at school I was taught that by changing the order of factors the result does not change Memories of that teaching alas not recent reverse the usual course of the explanation of vote anticipating at the beginning that the vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will be favorable This reversal does not depend on the desire for originality or the desire to distinguish me in some way but rather on the determination to make a contribution to the conversion of the decree law in question The need to convert it by 30 April has given us the time limit so that we have arrived in this House without the rapporteur and without the possibility of improving the text of the measure by tabling amendments and all other acts that usually fall under the prerogatives of a Member of Parliament Let me be clear I 'm not complaining about this In the past I have argued that it is not the Italian Parliament that can determine the development of raw materials at world level nor decide the development of the markets The only part of our control is time but it is crucial because it would allow us to prevent a fair and appropriate measure from not being effective because it is not timely Therefore I welcome the timeliness of the intervention and point out that the contraction of the times is an essential objective element It would be unforgivable if this decree were to lose its effectiveness so I take note of the impossibility of proceeding differently and accept the fact that this Assise will not be able to contribute to the improvement of the provision At the same time however I would like to leave a trace of what we could have done to improve the measure which is unquestionably necessary Some colleagues have censored the government 's alleged abuse of the urgent decree while in this case I believe that no one could discuss the existence of all the requirements of necessity and urgency However I would like to go beyond this reflection and point out that in fact yes all the requirements are met but they should not have been Italy was also the fourth world economy thanks in part or in large part to its manufacturing activity What was the fourth world economy and it is still one of the world 's major economies cannot and must not be found unprepared in the face of an emergency like this It needed programming and avoiding improvisation as unfortunately has been done In fact when you improvise you risk pursuing a dream but you do n't achieve a goal In the past always from this scranno I have highlighted the difference between an objective and a dream the dream is intangible that of going to the moon we can all have it but it is not concrete while the objective is concrete because it is monitorable programmable and staggered in stages that can be progressively implemented and verified in their implementation Some of my colleagues also in this debate have highlighted the need to have only renewable sources That is a beautiful dream which I share but it is indeed such Let 's do a parallel and imagine if the dream of fully electric mobility was implemented immediately What would happen if our entire fleet of passenger cars became electric tomorrow Let 's imagine an exodus of normal August with endless files and civil protection that often has to intervene compared to what would be if all the machines were electric To the normal and usual pathological elements that determine that situation we should in fact add a less autonomy and a greater time of charging of the vehicles which on average exceeds half an hour if it now takes five minutes to make a full of gasoline to recharge whole an electric machine it takes more than half an hour Therefore we must not pursue dreams otherwise we risk renewing that mistake that in the past has caused fundamental choices for our economy and for our country to be put aside Some Members have mentioned nuclear power we might remember many others but this is not the time What I want to highlight is that it is necessary to recover the vision that I do not say generational as it was once for which works were started although knowing that it would not be seen the completion but at least a medium term programming it is indispensable otherwise we will always have to intervene in emergencies and improvise Having said that however I remind myself first of all and my colleagues why this measure is so important and I do so starting not so much from the positive that there is but rather from what is missing to repeat again that the Senate could have made an important contribution to improving this measure It contains a decision which I fully agree with that of the amendment to Article 142 of the Code of Cultural Heritage and the Landscape The League has always asked for simplifications it has done so for the procurement code and for administrative procedures it does so on every subject in this specific case in my opinion the useful and appropriate choice has been to provide precisely a simplification for interventions that could benefit from the superbonus in the cases provided for in Article 142 I now turn to the Government because the lack of time will prevent us from intervening today and in an imminent future but it would not prevent the Government from intervening in a subsequent measure I therefore call on my fellow Members of the Government to pay particular attention to this point because it is a request for action It is useful and appropriate as I said to provide for simplifications and greater possibilities for action in relation to Article 142 In my view it was a wrong choice to exclude Article 136 from these possibilities For colleagues who perhaps want to have a clearer idea of what I am saying Article 142 of the code of cultural goods and landscape refers to areas protected by law now at last it is possible in the intervention also to partially modify the silhouette and volumes of the building because it is absurd that you benefit from a public contribution and you cannot improve the building However this should also be done for the cases referred to in Article 136 which are buildings and areas of considerable public interest I imagine that in the discussion at the Chamber he discussed opposing interests and prevailing requirements and that therefore for some objective motivation perhaps referring to the main Italian cities it was decided to exclude Article 136 from these possibilities I would point out however that the exclusion of Article 136 for the earthquake victims is an important and enormous obstacle to reconstruction Several times I have pointed out that in the attribution of priorities in government action we should have operated as doctors do in a First Aid when they attribute the codes the code red is not given to the healthy patient who has a small cut in an arm it is given to the patient who risks dying or anyway to the serious patient The same thing the Government and Parliament should have done in their action precisely as Executive and Legislative we should have given a red code and priorities to those who risk dying In this case by bringing the parallel to today 's debate we should have given it to the earthquake stricken municipalities which could and should have benefited from the possibilities now available to them under Article 142 extending this intervention to Article 136 Therefore my heartfelt invitation to the Government to provide for it immediately because Parliament could do so in a next measure but we do not know when it will be The government could do that right away I therefore ask you please on behalf of all those people to intervene in a timely manner I see that the time at my disposal is unfortunately almost over I would just like to point out that there are many reasons to vote in favour of this measure not least the 8 billion 6 of which are destined to fight the dear energy an issue which the League has immediately brought to the attention of the parliamentary assemblies but also of the national leadership There is an intervention in this sense and therefore our vote will be strongly favorable because it is a measure albeit not definitive and complete very useful to the country
"Mr President as I do often I would like to divide my speech between the things that I am satisfied with with the provisions of the measure and the things that have left me puzzled This is not with the intention of making controversy or complaining but only and exclusively with the hope of indicating a direction of indicating objectives that in my opinion it would be important to pursue in order to draw a line that leads us to the end of the legislature Given my origin obviously the first reason for satisfaction is on a solution that we will offer to the municipalities inserted in the perimeter of the seismic crater Some might mistakenly think that almost six years after the first shock the crater 's emergencies and emergencies have been overcome but that is not the case I want to go beyond the usual names known by everyone and talk about Municipalities like Ussita or like Castelsantangelo sul Nera which will probably be unknown to most but which together with the Municipality of Visso according to a calculation if I remember well made by the former head of the special office for the reconstruction of the Marche Region engineer Spuri alone represent 10 percent of the damages found in the Province of Macerata This province alone presents 65 of the damage of the Marche region and alone has twice the damage of the other three Regions put together This is to say that areas devastated by the earthquake where there are more damage than almost any other area of the crater do not yet have a crane in the old town I say this to point out that the emergency is far from over and that the needs of these areas are far from over This is why providing for the transfer of resources for the lower revenue of the waste tax Tari to these municipalities is very important Given that as I said before we are approaching the end of the parliamentary term I would like to remind not so much myself or colleagues here but also and especially those who will come after us because it is essential to continue to foresee these resources Someone naively and simplistically might think that since there are fewer people the cost of urban cleanliness service is lower But it is n't The cost could be divided into two macro- categories the variable costs obviously linked to the contribution and therefore reduced due to the minor presences and the fixed costs of the staff who do the collection rounds and the means These are costs which regardless of the quantity collected are fixed All our internal areas on average have about half of second houses and half of houses of residents There are places however with a particular touristic vocation in which this relationship is distorted I am still taking the example of Ussita if I remember correctly in Ussita there are over 2,000 second homes with a resident population of about 400 people Indicatively I think I am not far from the truth claiming that about 90 percent of the houses are second homes that contribute to the coverage of the cost of collecting solid urban waste and that therefore having been declared totally unactable at this time contribute zero to the income of the Municipality If we consider then that about half of the residents are in contribution of autonomous accommodation therefore not resident in the emergency housing solutions SAE that could contribute to the payment of the tax we get that about 5 percent of the resident population should cover in full the residual cost of the service that could be quantified in about 80 85 percent of the cost before earthquake That is why it is essential to guarantee these resources because otherwise we would bring that cost to increase by a measure that has not yet been quantified accurately by all the municipalities but that could be triple or quadruple compared to what was before the earthquake It is clear that this is not acceptable because it creates a huge inequality against those who have already been so penalized It is also not acceptable because it also goes against the always proclaimed intention of avoiding the depopulation of the internal areas favouring if possible even resettlement intention that clearly with the removal of the services and the increase of the costs we will never pursue It is true that in the mountains we are accustomed to solidarity on the contrary In fact solidarity usually provides that those who have more can give to those who have less Those who live in an already difficult situation who pay more fuel than those who live in the city who pay much more heating because not only the cost is higher but the need is for a longer period those who pay the basic necessities already more than everyone else obviously makes solidarity We know very well that more than half of the cost of fuel is of taxes so if we pay more fuel in the mountains we obviously contribute to those services which the State then reserves to us to a minimum and which benefit instead of those in other areas We are therefore accustomed to solidarity on the contrary but beyond certain limits we could not afford it If then we really want to make it easier to stay in the inland areas and to promote resettlement in those areas we need to take specific choices and solutions to achieve this objective That is why I must express regret at what is missing and this gives me the opportunity to move on to the second part of my speech especially with the aim of indicating what I think we should do to remedy problems I had tabled amendments not only on Tari but also on the possibility of derogating from Article 136 of the Cultural Heritage Code I had presented two one for all the national territory because in my opinion the inequality created between those who are subject to the constraint provided for in Article 142 and those who are subject to that provided for in Article 136 was inexcusable another on the other hand is specific for the earthquake areas The reason for this dual re-submission is because the time for the entire national territory is reduced compared to what is possible for the earthquake areas since we have granted a derogation until 2025 Therefore I was hoping that at least for the earthquake areas the amendment would be accepted since almost all the buildings of the municipalities to be rebuilt fall within the constraints of Article 136 Unfortunately this has not yet been the case but I hope that can be achieved This also allows me to close the intervention by referring to the bonus situation especially the 110 bonus which as we know has encountered many difficulties in its implementation and at this time as a resource is risking becoming a problem The title of an article this morning speaks of nearly 33,000 failed builders for 2 billion frozen bonuses banks no longer accept accrued loans and craft companies find themselves with full tax drawers but without a penny of liquidity I close pointing out that last year we might have changed a paradigm for years to highlight how important public and private works were for the recovery of the economy we talked about Marshall Plan now we could also talk about bonuses because if the exit from the economic crisis caused by lockdown was better than expectations it was also largely because interventions on Italian real estate have favored this economic growth This will be crucial for the sustainability of our debt Let 's not stop this flywheel I therefore call on the Government to resolve these difficulties immediately and to give that certainty that it should be a fundamental principle of our legal system but that it is lacking at this time"
"Minister with the Fit for 55 package formalized by the European Commission on 14 July 2021 with the aim of revising much of the current legislation on climate and energy the European Union has set itself the ambitious target of reducing emissions of newly registered cars by 55 by 2030 compared to 2021 and 100 by 2035 On the occasion of the information presented in Parliament with a view to the meeting of Energy and Environment Ministers of the G7 in Berlin last May Minister Cingolani reported on a strong commitment of the G7 countries to support decarbonisation in the transport sector as a significant contribution to the reduction of emissions in order to maintain the increase of the temperature within the degree and half centigrade The Minister reiterated the Italian position in favour of a rapid decarbonisation of the automotive sector but highlighted the need to identify diversified timing between light vehicles and heavy vehicles in order to allow an ambitious but just transition to national specificities regarding the development of the necessary infrastructure the adaptation of the production system to new technologies the importance of focusing also on other sustainable fuels and innovative technologies However with regard to the Fit for 55 package of measures the European Parliament at its recent meeting on 8 June 2022 approved the ban on the sale of internal combustion cars from 2035 as a priority contribution to the 55 reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 with a view to achieving the Union 's climate neutrality by 2050 as dictated by the European Green Deal Roadmap This will mean that in the immediate future only the sale of electric cars in Europe will be allowed considered by the EU a virtually exclusive solution to the sustainable transport of the Union demonstrating an ideological and demagogic approach to the ecological transition Given that the Italian automotive sector is worth 5.6 percent of national GDP and employs over 250,000 employees representing an excellence on the world scene also in terms of avant garde and technological innovation and therefore of environmental sustainability it is clear that the measure will result in an important alteration in the sector and in the economies of the countries Europe is still far from being independent of non-EU economies as regards the availability of raw materials their ability to transform and create all the components necessary for the construction of the vehicle Since I believe that my time is running out I come directly to the question It is asked to know which measures the Minister in address intends to put in place at national and European level to counter the ideological approach undertaken by the EU to achieve climate neutrality through drastic and utopian measures in the field of electric automotive one of the main national excellences and to promote a true sustainable ecological transition in the short and long term allowing with a gradual approach the holding of the country 's economic system in achieving the ambitious goals of climate neutrality of the EU responding to the commitment of the Minister himself to ensure an ambitious but just transition on national specificities and the importance of focusing also on other sustainable fuels and innovative technologies"
"Mr Minister I agree with everything you have said partly because I have said the same things several times in the past but I cannot say that I am completely satisfied with the answer because on the point that was a priority for me that is to say the employment and rescue of our national industry in fact it did not say anything at all Previously when I spoke of 5,6 of GDP I was obviously only referring to what comes directly from the sector then if we were to talk about induced we would get higher figures This clearly can only be a priority With regard to the criterion of technological neutrality I claim its birthright in the political debate because as soon as the Draghi Government was born in the Environment Commission I pointed out that being a very heterogeneous majority the only common sense approach not dogmatic nor ideological but exclusively of common sense was precisely technological neutrality an approach that in reality did not exist In our intentions yes we all probably share it but then in reality especially in European politics that is not the case I would therefore ask you again Minister since you have just said that you share this suggestion that I had allowed myself to move forward to the Environment Commission a year and a half ago to continue strongly to support it because as you said earlier there are technological alternatives but we will not save the environment by preventing the possibility of science which is proving that precisely these alternatives are there Let us put the problem as a policy but let us leave it to science to find the answer only in this way can we be sure that we will do what we can to improve the situation"
Mr President if anyone were to ask me what the aid decree is for me I would say that it is the standard act for which the Dragon Government was born and for which the majority supported it This is a measure that contains a large sum of about 20 billion in favour of Italian companies in favour of Italian families and local authorities It is practically a measure that supports Italians and Italians in the light of the difficult moment that we are living The measures were listed first in detail the bonus of 200 euros the 7 billion to contain the expensive electricity and gas bills in the third quarter of this year the 23 million euros for the dear diesel oil the liquidity to companies In short it is a measure that deserves our support a measure that makes me scream even if it is underneath nothing but free cane and easy citizenship It is a measure that Italy needs All this happens in a difficult context which still sees Italy in the grip of the pandemic for economic health and social problems a pandemic that seems not to want to abandon us and that is still threatening our country in recent weeks Then the war broke out at the gates of Europe we have an inflation that exceeds 8.5 there are the expensive bills the gas cut by Russia the loss of the purchasing power of salaries and pensions the debitory records knocking on the doors of the Italians There will be € 26 billion debitory folders € 2.6 billion has already been notified and expects a total of € 13 billion to be notified by the end of the year I would like to say a few words what does Italy need in this regard It needs another renewed convinced fiscal peace and for this reason the League and Matthew Salvini fight a fiscal peace that aims to protect not criminals and evaders but those people who unfortunately have found themselves in difficulty and have not been able to honour their debts to the Erario people who are not to be abandoned or massacred but supported because it is necessary even more at a time like this to give them a new opportunity Then we have the high prices of raw materials which also puts construction in difficulty we have the high prices of food and as if it were not enough drought has been added In this context in which all of us have been called to responsibility in which the League has renewed until last night a behavior based on responsibility and loyalty provided that it is aid to Italy provided that the nation is supported I say it not because I allow myself to judge in the house of others but it is right that Italians say it what does the Movimento 5 Stars do Run away in the face of responsibility Run in front of an important act of about 20 billion in favor of the Italians Last night we had a nightmare like me many Italians an absurd nightmare a country ours the Bel Paese was nailed for hours and hours to wait for the outcome of the national council the message of President Conte a nightmare because it reminded us of that expectation of the famous directs of two years ago of President Conte when he was to announce in a facebook non-existent decrees in a Facebook way during a pandemic in full gravity managed in the worst of ways But can Italy really continue to live waiting for those moments And then what gave birth to the consultation lasted a day An incomprehensible statement which should be translated out of respect not for us but for the Italians out of intellectual honesty towards the Italians After hours and hours of confrontation President Count says that the Movimento 5 Stars does not vote and therefore escape from the responsibilities that however is ready to support the Government and President Draghi without signing bills of exchange in white in spite of the most difficult and incomprehensible language of the First Republic Then there is even an escape forward President Conte says that the announced massive decree full bodied that President Draghi proposed by the end of July makes him happy and makes joyful the entire Movimento 5 Stars and that that same decree is due to the political action of the Movimento 5 Stars This is completely incomprehensible Today we are dealing with an important measure one of the most important of this majority and of the current Government and just a few minutes from the vote we do not know what the political force that represents the largest number of Members in this House and also in the House of Members really wants to do The moment of responsibility is not over it is in full Honesty and not that which you called with great malice but intellectual honesty towards the Italians who have given you confidence is in the fullness of his moment We do not expect to convince you or judge you that is what Italians and Italians will do but we demand to free Italy which can no longer be hostage to a bluff because the Movimento 5 Stars has turned out to be a real bluff Italy has to run Italy must return to dream and this is done in two ways either with an authoritative and solid Government or giving the word back to the Italians No more threats Enough with the palace games that look at your selfish interests and not at the general interests of the Italians
PEPE L SP PSd Az Mr President on behalf of the Group to which I belong Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione and also on my personal behalf as a lucano I have the honour to recall in this House a very authoritative personality important for Basilicata Senator Romualdo Coviello who left us a few days ago a personality that has done so much for our region and in a spirit of unity of the nation also for the whole of the Mezzogiorno Mr President you mentioned the institutional path of Senator Romualdo Coviello I would like to add that he has been one of the constituents of the Basilicata Region a region that has administered continuously for twenty five years covering both executive and executive roles as city councilor and of representation par excellence such as that of President of the Regional Council I also repeat the fact that he has been an excellent parliamentary representative of this branch of Parliament for another twenty years where he has been able to bring the demands of his territory that territory that was in distress in difficulty with respect to the rest of the country and that he had to catch up with a delay that could no longer be justified He has been able to combine the institutional role as has just been said with the political role I was n't lucky enough to know him personally but I 've heard about him so much and well They tell me he did n't disdain political militancy at all Mr Pittella used to say that he knew how to look far away but he also knew how to keep his ears on the ground as they say and therefore to be close to the territory and to his own people in addition to his academic commitment All this led him to carry forward the theory of a self propulsive development of our Region a theory that I think is very current Surely today we would have been on different political sides but this condition would not have prevented us from looking at it and confronting it with respect because respect deserved it all As a young institutional representative of Basilicata I address the following wish meanwhile to me and to the entire Lucanian ruling class that begins to undertake a journey if I were to borrow a teaching from Senator Romualdo Coviello it would be to carry out political and institutional commitment with dedication with passion and so much study that never hurts For this reason on behalf of and on behalf of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione he reaches the children of the late Senator Romualdo Coviello his family and all his loved ones our heartfelt respectful affectionate and heartfelt greeting
Mr President undersecretary Gava ladies and gentlemen the high prices in this case the high prices relating to the cost of energy and gas are making itself felt heavily on Italian households and at the same time is holding back growth On the one hand it puts families in difficulty and on the other it prevents those who do business from moving forward growing and developing Yesterday 's forecast by the International Monetary Fund that GDP in Italy in the current year will be around 2.3 unlike last year when it stood at 6.6 One of the causes that determines this discrasia in negative is the energy dependence of Italy from other countries This is an issue as happens in other areas which policy must address as is happening from two points of view firstly from the point of view of contingency and secondly from the perspective and the future What has been done about contingency A measure has been taken to limit the increase in the cost of energy and gas for households businesses and local authorities with an important allocation As far as we are concerned it is likely that if we need another budget this Government and this Parliament will only be able to act in this direction On the other hand what should be done in perspective We must speak frankly and radically change the approach to what has been until recently Enough with ideology enough with no enough with senseless fears enough with irresponsible attitudes We must move forward with common sense and pragmatism in the interests of our country first and foremost We must exploit natural resources where there are we must have common sense and the responsible approach to taking advantage of the discoveries of science and technology at the same time we must have the courage to diversify sources Renewable Yes absolutely yes but we need to accompany the energy transition Europe says so not just us bad ligistics with the latest generation of gas and nuclear power This is an inevitable route except that someone does not want to imagine that instead of our beautiful country there is the wonderful panorama of Heidi and the grandfather of Heidi There is also another important aspect It has been considered the forecast of the import of gas but as far as we are concerned certainly noteworthy attention must also be given to the production of gas within our own country What is achieved by this pragmatic responsible and common sense approach We support families who can grow and be founded with serenity and safety because if we rely on technology we do not put at risk either the health of people or the health of the environment around us Businesses are supported which can benefit from a new shift in pace and pace thanks to the prospect of a new technology We must also give concrete support here too to the municipalities because if they are not supported from the point of view of the cost of energy gas and not only they will inevitably have to struggle for a lower quality of services and there will be an inevitable increase in taxes on citizens And we cannot and must not allow that today I would like to make another reflection on renewable energy We know I know from direct experience that there are countless disputes between those who have put up renewable energy plants and the GSE in some cases and the Revenue Agency in other cases A hypothesis that cannot be overlooked is to look carefully at these disputes and to consider putting in place a measure that either suspends them or cancels them completely or at least revises the chapter of sanctions and interests In fact we have already existing plants which are blocked by these disputes and which could so much give Italy in terms of lower costs and greater renewable energy Then we have the bureaucracy With this decree law an important step forward has been taken there has been an acceleration but it is not enough We know that in some ways Italy attracts investment from the point of view of renewable energies but at the same time what blocks them or even rejects them is the length of the technical administrative procedures of our country It is a field challenge and is the most important if you really want to move on Today what is happening in Puglia and specifically in Taranto The first offshore wind power plant is inaugurated which is authorized and whose tape is cut sixteen years after the project is presented it is something unacceptable and incomprehensible especially at a time like this Some regions need to be given a look at There are some that have natural resources they already have opportunities for the hands on which they have direct ownership and on some events they do not even have to wait for the intervention of the state I urge these regions to immediately make available to their citizens economic resources or natural resources such as gas because people cannot and must no longer wait What has happened in these two years The world has changed because there has been a pandemic because there is a war going on at the gates of Europe and because priorities have changed and politics must live up to this change that there has been so abruptly Politics cannot give up it must not fall back on itself but it must re-launch in our view on the basis of two essential aspects On the one hand the mistakes of the past must no longer be committed One of these mistakes is that obtuse populist irresponsible and senseless environmentalism that has stopped the country for too long We can no longer repeat these mistakes To be clear it is that environmentalism that it is an example of many is manifesting itself in the Adriatic Sea where from the same basin there is Croatia pulling gas and Italy that for this ideology does not pull anything On the other hand the strength is the courage of new ideas avant garde ideas and concrete actions Today is the birthday of Rome and to this city I address I imagine on behalf of all a deep and heartfelt wish Yesterday the mayor of Rome Gualtieri debunked this taboo of obtuse environmentalism senseless and irresponsible and announced that by 2025 he will realize a thermo-valuer for the city of Rome It took a huge pile of waste and perhaps the energy crisis to convince the mayor to do this We learn this news so favorably also because I want to remember that there is no greater victory than seeing your adversary 's mouth shine your truth This happened today in Rome and we hope that it will happen throughout the country with courage with vision with responsibility in the interest of all Italians after having definitively archived an ideology that has never had a sense of existence and that today even more has no sense that it continues to exist
Mr President Mr Undersecretary ladies and gentlemen I would like to make a few comments on the debate that has taken place over these hours and days on the reform that we are discussing We have always said as a League that we are in favour of an integral organic and incisive reform of the judicial system and we have always said that following the approval of the House of Deputies we would work in this House to improve the so called Cartabia reform We have always said this because the League has been consistent with itself it has been transparent towards the Italians and it has also been correct towards the allies that at this moment make up the majority that supports the Government Dragons We have always said that the reform as well as leaving the Chamber of Deputies does not give us satisfaction and that we would try as we will to improve it in the Senate For those who are treacherous and I am sorry there is the press review of April 22 in which it is clearly said that the will of the League is to improve the reform of Cartabia in the Senate says the Corriere della Sera says Free says the Republic says The Press and says The Sun 24 Hours Nor is it true as some have suggested this morning that the will to maintain the amendments to the text is a reaction to the referendum We had said this from the beginning because we had a strong and consolidated conviction from the beginning and the only effect that the referendum had was to strengthen it The referendum was in itself a great and extraordinary victory because it was a democratic exercise which we wanted along with many other political actors and Italian civil society others praise it but obviously at the practical moment they fail to give it the right value It was also a great success because the yes prevailed by far over the no and those 10 million Italians who went to the polls deserve respect and consideration At this moment the only way to give respect and consideration is to bring those amendments forward to improve the text that came out of the House I say by the way I allow myself to do so because before me people have said it much more authoritative than me who belong to a world different from mine that is Violante and Spataro that the only real failure in this affair is represented by the incomprehensible strike of the magistrates This was the only real failure which marked a watershed between an old way of understanding the relationship between the judiciary and the country and a new way of understanding that relationship which is evidently tired of old logic and old interpretation So we 're against the Cartabia reform No not at all We are in favour of reform of justice otherwise we would not have promoted the referendum But let us say that the reform must be worthy of this name it must be a more incisive reform a true reform We are not content with the balance that this unnatural majority imposes anyway because we must give account to our country and we must give account to the Italians That of the CSM as my colleague Simone Pillon said before is a sloppy reform which does not actually cancel the currents and does not cancel the power of the currents We are convinced even today that the main way for this to happen is the draw integral and temperate Let 's go on the logic of the draw because it is the only road that allows us to break the link between the currents and the judiciary On the evaluation of judges it is okay that there is an annual and no longer four year dossier but it is also okay that the assessment should be decided not only by the members of the judicial councils but also by the lay members university teachers and lawyers On the separation of functions we would have liked and want more courage and we will do so in this debate today in this House so that we can decide from the beginning of the work and professional journey whether we are on the side of the judiciary or whether we are on the side of the judiciary We also agree on revolving doors because we believe that policymakers should remain outside the judiciary Those who decide to belong to a political party or movement decide in a legitimate way not to be impartial and embrace an ideology a world and certain logics that no longer allow them to be magistrates This which unfortunately the text we are working on does not provide for must apply not only to those who have the honour and the burden of being elected after an election campaign but also to those who simply want to run The moment of discrimination is not the election but the candidacy at that moment the will to belong to one political area is manifested rather than to another We are satisfied with the stop to package appointments and also with the reduction of the number of magistrates who I say with respect are parked at the Ministries However we would have liked more courage incisiveness and organicity Some say let us do this quickly because Europe is asking us to do it and why we have to implement the PNRR It is true and this will must be respected However as President Ostellari said earlier Europe is asking us not only to do things quickly but also to do better and better than what has been done in the past Let 's say more we must reform the justice system because Italy and the Italians have been asking us for decades and not for a few months like Europe so that our country can live up to its history and its great civilization That is why we cannot waste this historic opportunity which will not be resumed in this parliamentary term Certainly we will do so in the next when there will be a more courageous homogeneous centre right majority with a different and healthier view of the justice system I would like to make one final appeal to this House We are talking about justice that is that little piece of our country system that judges in some cases our freedom and in others our heritage Let us use this historic opportunity to make a true and real reform that the Italians want and for which they have given us confidence
"Mr President you will forgive me if I say that I make this brief speech as mayor rather than as senator proudly mayor of the third term of office of a small municipality The small municipalities which represent 69 percent of the Italian municipalities are 5,500 small municipalities that have been rediscovered in recent months and years like the architrave of Italy We all remember what the mayors did during the pandemic If there were n't those mayors along with the health staff how much greater difficulties Italy would have had and would have had to face the Italians Those mayors have taken on many responsibilities both in relation to what was the health sector and in relation to the distribution of vouchers to so many citizens where at first there were no rules but the only pulse of the situation was the state of need of so many families Then we also saw mayors on the front line And we are seeing them now during this incomprehensible and unjustifiable war in Ukraine while they welcome and stretch their hand all lined up and lined up women and children waiting to ask the state for help both financial and logistical Mr President now there is also a great expectation which I would like to point out here as far as the PNRR is concerned I feel too often that we have to wait for the mayors and their ability to implement the mayors and that the ability to develop a strategy lies with them Too many however are those who philosophize behind a desk and forget that very often mayors do not have the right tools to implement the PNRR I 'm on my own in the vast majority of cases Mr President I also say that in the various selections that have been made in recent months for the PNRR the results have not always been satisfactory I 'm talking about it from experience Fresh and competent forces often do not arrive in the municipalities neither fresh nor competent forces arrive unable to support the mayors As a result everyone refers to the mayors We 're proud ready we 're not gonna back down Let us however give the right recognition to those gentlemen who dress the tricolor band with dignity As many people have said before me the measure we are examining and will be approving shortly is important but it is a minority part of a broader and more incisive reform that we all hope for It starts from the inconferability of top management positions in bodies governed by private law under public control for those who have suffered a conviction even not final in the context of crimes against public administration We move through the abolition of the control of the management of small municipalities and we arrive at the third mandate As Senator Candiani said before we must say thanks to those mayors who are still in their place today who decide to run But we want many more reforms Some may relate to the single text of local authorities Legislative Decree No 267 of 2000 I can think of for example the profile of responsibility As far as I am concerned Mr President it was already quite clear Evidently however some magistrates pretended not to understand it or thought well that throwing a mayor in the papers rather than an executive would do more news Already from Bassanini laws however from the single text of the local authorities the tasks are clearly divided the politician and the mayor have the powers of political direction and political control the manager or the manager of the service the management and the assumption of the acts The mayor however is always there like a lightning rod The delegation law is now in place which we hope will lead to an even better clarification of this issue as soon as possible Therefore mayors will no longer oversee the operation of the services and offices nor will they oversee the execution of acts And we hope that this specification will finally put an end to the mayor 's criminal responsibility in particular Mr President I would also go further because this is an issue that has been raised by President Ostellari I would not just stop at the unique text of the local authorities but I would go further looking at the penal code and the official abuse that so many mayors have put under investigation and perhaps even under trial Then however in the vast majority of cases everything melted like snow in the sun since the abuse of office is subjected to the so called diabolical test because the mayor has never been in bad faith has not had the specific dole has not violated the norm has not violated the regulation and has not harmed anyone or any unfair advantage to anyone else A little courage would take to make this important change Among other things the President of ANCI said this this means not asking for impunity for the mayors but to make those people work in serenity and tranquillity knowing that where they were to commit crimes they will surely answer for their responsibilities Protecting mayors also means protecting democratic participation How many times in small municipalities we are forced to attend the presentation of so called owl lists where there are no people willing to sacrifice themselves and engage in an electoral competition and if anything also in the administration of the municipality Besides the mayors can't run anywhere but they 're there Even in small municipalities if they are not in town hall they are at the professional studio and if they are not even there they are at home They are present garrison of civilization and freedom to guarantee services and rights Another bad page for the mayors even to show that they are the outpost of the state on the territory is represented let us remember by the innumerable threats intimidating and offensive acts that suffer both de visu and now alas with the abuse of the use of social media Only in 2021 were the intimidating acts 722 We demand dignity and even more agility some others might speak of more powers because it is too easy to say that with direct election the mayor has more powers In fact especially in small realities the mayor does not have all these powers He has many responsibilities but he does n't have many powers because often in those realities he can't even choose the manager and the manager having to limit himself to choosing fortunately at least the municipal secretary To conclude I would like to mention Article 114 of our Constitution which was first mentioned in 2001 and which reads extraordinarily beautifully The Republic consists of the Municipalities Provinces Metropolitan Cities Regions and State These are the various institutional levels of our country that we believe must have equal dignity Senator Candiani said earlier that very often mayors can bring added value to institutions Many times speaking with friends I make a joke destined to remain so because it would not be allowed by our Constitution it would take a minimum of cursus honorum I believe that this is another aspect and it is up to the parties to make a selection But many local administrators and many more mayors in an institution like this would bring the royal country into the palace and render a far better service to the whole country"
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen in the meantime I think I share a wish shared by the whole of this House namely that the positive signals coming from Turkey from last night can become concrete and definitive signs of peace as soon as possible I would like to make some comments on the decree law that we are about to approve The measure in fact does not only deal with weapons but also with other weapons Some Members mentioned earlier that it is about the reception of refugees the decree law has allocated important sums but we all know that we will need more to ensure reception health care and services for these women and these children who really flee from the war In this context I take the opportunity to say although I know that our parent Massimiliano Romeo together with other colleagues is already moving in this direction that it is right and proper to move in time so as not to burden all this situation on the Italian municipalities both from the economic and logistic point of view and services It is important that the system be set up immediately that coordination be carried out so that the service can be best served so that the Italian citizens cannot be indirectly welcomed by the people we all want and we must offer them The numbers to date are as follows 74,000 refugees in Italy of which 29,000 are minors So on the one hand there is the attention of the State on the other the great heart of Italy has emerged The Italians have all mobilized themselves individually and associated to welcome these people but also to bring to the borders with the lands of conflict basic necessities Another important measure the operation and security of the offices that Italy has abroad of the staff that Italy has abroad but also of the interests that Italy cultivates in the countries that can be most affected by this conflict It means protecting our women and our men who proudly represent the country abroad On everyone I want to remember our ambassador Zazo who was a hero of modern time a hero who saved 100 people a hero who kept open the only embassy seat in Ukraine ours the one with the tricolor There are measures that concern university students university teachers companies that are suffering from this conflict Then there is also the provision that provides for the disposal of military equipment equipment and equipment free of charge not lethal It is a necessary measure a measure that does not declare war a measure that was indispensable On the other hand we are talking about peace We want peace true peace not that which appeals to pacifism True peace where peoples love each other and live together very well But it must also be said as Mr Candura said very well before that there is a state that has attacked and a state that has been attacked How do you get peace If Russia stops or Ukraine stops The message is clear Let us be clear because we all know this and above all all our fellow citizens can know it in the right way and in the right direction The only way to achieve peace is for Russia to stop If Russia stops peace is achieved and war ends if Ukraine stops Ukraine ends it disappears from the map The only way to achieve peace is that during the time that diplomacy is at work Ukraine can defend itself and can limit the offense that Russia is unjustly causing it This is a fact if Russia stops the war ends if Ukraine stops Ukraine ends Let 's be clear otherwise we do n't understand each other and fall into the misunderstanding It is a difficult time this we are living an extraordinarily difficult time We 've had two years of pandemics and now we have this conflict We have companies in difficulty families in difficulty We are touching problems that we would never have imagined until recently And if it is an extraordinary and difficult time we need an extraordinary commitment on the one hand and we need the unity of the country on the other hand An extraordinary commitment does not mean trenching behind labels and behind slogans We know the country is on its knees but we have to work to get the country up An extraordinary commitment means at the same time respecting international agreements because it is the result of the credibility and authority of our country but it also means supporting families and businesses We will begin immediately from the decree cuts prices but we will continue with the next measures with the next financial and also with the admission of further deviations Let 's not shout at the scandal We have families on their knees We can help them We have companies in difficulty we have to help them Above all we do not accept lessons from those who have been the author by political will of waste par excellence We can talk about the scooters that invade our sidewalks of the wheelchairs of the masks of Arcuri but also of the income of citizenship that so much waste and so many scams has provoked Mr President I shall end with unity The unity is required by President Mattarella who must be our lighthouse always and not if necessary A unity cannot be betrayed for a different political vision at this time because if we are in the majority it is in the spirit of sacrifice and service to Italy Even less so the unit must not be betrayed just to chase the polls This would be a very serious mistake I will really finish Mr President If we are aware that we live in an extraordinary time and that our honor is the Armed Forces let us all rise to their level and rank This means work a sense of responsibility a sense of the institutions and a few words Especially during this period words weigh like stones and if we use the right words and tones we can help the path of peace in the shortest possible time"
Mr President I did not actually intend to speak in general debate because I thought I could do so in the debate on the vote of confidence that all the newspapers today announce as certain However it is enough to read the agencies or to listen to what is happening outside this Chamber to understand that there is an attempt which we can call desperate to avoid the vote of confidence because the Movimento 5 Stars said that it would not give confidence to the Government of which it is the main representative And then I run to the shelter and I speak now even if only for six minutes I understand very well the correct intransigence now we call it that of President Draghi who said no to Draghi bis putting in ambasce those who would like to pull the rope without breaking it They 'd like to pull the string have some protagonism but go ahead and sit in the chair That 's the figure So what 's the attempt It 's to put the dust under the carpet How do you do that They say not to take a vow of trust Finally after an incredible number of votes of confidence this time that serves to clarify the Government is desperately trying to have the amendments voted to hide under the carpet the dust raised by the Movimento 5 Stars which claims that the Government should fall I could say that we had said that and that from the beginning we had argued that this Government is an iattura for Italy No you do n't I say and I am referring to the friends of the centre right that I have always respected their choice different from ours to be in the government but I am glad that they have now considered the fact that with this Government and under current conditions we can not continue While there are expensive bills war inflation and everything we know Draghi cannot spend his days agreeing not only the center right with the center left but also Letta con Renzi Conte con Di Maio e Conte con stesso Poor Dragons must do that too We therefore feel that we should appeal to the President of the Republic who is among the very few who have not voted for him to whom he knows he joins me with a personal esteem and also with something that is very similar to friendship President Mattarella I know that you even by a political nature are trying to find a way to rectify the situation but please look at what is happening in this House this time and listen to the speeches that are taking place I do not say in the First Republic but in any parliament of the world a government with positions of such profound contrast between the parties that compose it as it is happening here would not stand Mr President of the Republic instead of attempting an impossible patchwork do what the Constitution allows you to do in this situation put your hand on your conscience and give the voice back to the Italians so as to have a compact cohesive government with a serious programme and not the ridiculous opposition that makes us and the Italians ashamed

"THE RUSSIAN FdI Mr President to commemorate a Member of Parliament a President of the European Parliament who has known and appreciated himself always gives a strong emotion an emotion that the whole House shares today Sassoli rather than an exponent of a political part was in fact a figure that we have always recognized as a man of the institutions He was a journalist on the main television network and he had been in his youth In common with him I found a figure it was also scout And perhaps it has affected his youthful militancy in his way of working and acting What was his way what we political opponents have always recognized and that made us appreciate it Being a man without prejudice strong in his ideas but loyal and able to confront and discuss with everyone to recognize the one who did not think like him as an opponent with whom to be able to confront It was a characteristic of him who accompanied him and made him a President of the European Parliament capable of giving voice to the various pressures needs dynamics such complex ones as those of a Parliament that gathers people from all over the world His line was a clear one a Europeanist political line a political line of tolerance of overcoming all diversity We have appreciated it sometimes opposed it but always recognized as an honest man and it is not little in today 's time and as a loyal man and even more in today 's time it is not so simple and so common Like everyone else when they see a danger approaching and even his illness lived it without us noticing it at least the vast majority of us he may have rethinked his political life which began in 2009 with 400,000 votes of preference I say this to this House which has long forgotten for reasons of law what it means to collect votes of preference He had 400,000 votes preferably in 2009 but then his ambition at a certain point was to try to be mayor of his city of adoption Rome He could n't do it there He took half of Marino 's vows but he did n't make it a drama There too his ability to deal with a problem without making a fuss or boasting about it Then in his election as President of the European Parliament he was able to distinguish himself at the time of the pandemic not to close but rather to prevent any real impediment to European parliamentary activity A man who has been able to give the role that covered a thickness such as politics would always need to have I believe that he is an example for those who have militated in his political part but allow me even for those who did not have his own ideas for those who were a political opponent but in him he is reflected in loyalty tolerance in the ability to face the adversaries with a smile humility and firmness Thank you David"
Mr President I would like to thank the Minister for Infrastructure for his presence Minister we have thought of directing this act of inspection union to you even if together with my colleague Mr Fazzolari we too have been tempted to insist with the Minister of the Interior on the matter of aggressions in Piazza Duomo As a friend of mine who is in North Africa told me there these kinds of attacks are called taharrush gamea which means collective harassment a kind of crime that must be tackled by not putting it together with so many other issues which in Italy you do not want to do and do not I would have said that on this issue but we have thought of other initiatives more serious than just a few minutes speech on a question here in Parliament I would like to ask you Minister with the first question I signed whether you intend to work to remedy a serious problem in the private rail sector and in road transport at medium and long distances which with the spread of the pandemic and with the measures of the government is suffering enormous damage if we consider that we are talking about a sector that lives on tickets of the travelling people so if people do not travel there is a serious risk of unemployment and disservices in transport I know that already yesterday perhaps after our proposal for a question something has been moved I am quite informed but I want to be sure that a package of measures that includes for example the extension of the integration fund but also all possible support for companies operating in free and private competition can be given I think of the dismantling of tolls both motorway and rail I think of a whole series of restaurants that can and must be given because the sector directly involves citizens but also many workers many companies and many industrial activities that are part of the wealth of our country I would ask whether you intend to work as I hope in this direction PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Sustainable Infrastructure and Mobility Professor Giovannini has the right to answer this question for three minutes
Mr President in Office of the Council thank you for agreeing to transform the Premier Question Time which was scheduled for today into the information requested first by Senator Rauti of the Brothers of Italy at the Conference of the Leaders I listened to your speech very carefully but I also recorded the applause that came they were almost never of its entire majority but in pieces that is sometimes applauded one and sometimes applauded another So my curiosity has increased to understand what will be the attitude of the interventions that still have to follow One I just listened to President Renzi's You had to struggle not only in international fora but also in our home you had a little trouble putting together positions very wide apart I 'm not going to list the fact that Count says something and Di Maio says exactly the opposite It is yesterday that the Presidency of the Foreign Affairs Commission emigration which fortunately ended with the election of a responsible person such as Senator Craxi to whom I wish good work So I 'm curious how everyone 's gonna pull the blanket a little bit On the contrary there is no doubt as to what the position of Brothers of Italy is because it is clear and coherent We have always been anchored and we remain to the Western world for our common cultural and values roots as ours are stories of economic commercial and even military alliances that sink when the Republic was born It has been since 1949 that the Italian right in its various political expressions MSI National Alliance then PdL and now Brothers of Italy has always consistently sided I say it to those who wondered on this side of the world in support of the Western defensive instrument that is NATO We have always felt that the danger to our independence and freedom came alas from the East in the post war period Senator Renzi quoted Berlinguer who it is true at some point tried to change and I give him notice what in Italy was a radically different position of the left which still we heard him here and there and not in the PD echoes different positions We have entrusted the burden of our defence to NATO but at the same time at least for Brothers of Italy we consider it absolutely important that sooner or later a truly European pillar of NATO arrives because it is one thing to be an ally and another to be a subject There are those who are against any military expenditure and it drives me crazy but at the same time they get angry when the Americans to whom we entrust our defense saying think about it yourselves are interfering in our policy Decide If you do not want excessive interference if you want to be equal you cannot be against the efforts necessary for a defense that never like at this time proves absolutely indispensable President Draghi war is not a lightning strike you know it and everyone knows it Russia 's expansionist policy is the daughter of the ideology of its mother Russia and Putin 's attempt to take back the territories that were of the Soviet Union is evident That is what explains the behaviour of Moldova and Georgia and why Finland is asking to join NATO it is clear what the policy and desire of Putin 's Russia is I was saying about the Soviet Union Faced with this we have to imagine that it is absolutely right to put a stop How With a direct NATO intervention in Ukraine No we'd be crazy as it would amplify the conflict We need to help them defend themselves How do you help them defend themselves By sending all necessary aid including in terms of defensive weapons What do you mean defensive weapons I hear we have to send non-lethal weapons Do we send medieval shields and helmets I do n't understand Do we send out sprung kitchen knives The weapons to defend themselves are the ones necessary to turn back those who invaded them It has been since Ukraine was invaded that the possible reasons of the invaders have completely failed This is our position There could have been a different argument but they did n't want it Then we who have constantly said that the defense is always legitimate at home and we want it when a thief enters our home at this point we can not really understand how to imagine that it is not legitimate the defense of those who are attacked in the house of their own nation We bow to the heroic defense of men women Ukrainian soldiers and not only in Mariupol but throughout Ukraine without exception We are careful not to fall into Putin 's trap we do not believe that those who are still fighting in the steel mill as they are even more heroic are more evil We must give full solidarity without exception to the men and women who fight hard to defend their homeland and their freedom but also our independence They do n't do it for us but it 's a consequence and I 'm surprised there 's someone who does n't understand it I am surprised that we do not see how we should be in solidarity today with those who are attacked in their own territory and in their own geographical political and human integrity and that defending themselves affirms the principle that this can not be done Certainly it costs and brings with it some drawbacks We know that we may have to pull the belt a little bit but there are valuable reasons why it is right to do so and these are more than enough for us However there are also very concrete reasons which the naives probably do not understand the West has responded compactly to the Russian aggression and if Italy today became the weak link and soft belly of the West breaking this compactness and questioning military support to Kiev we would become the Parish of the West the unreliable State as we are often painted And this would have enormous costs for us in terms not only of security but also of relations with the rest of the West which also means economic and commercial relations which affect the well being of Italians President we are on the side of Italy we are on the side of the attackers And to those who take back the same arguments that they used in 1956 when Hungary was invaded and in 1968 when the communist tanks invaded Prague because they wanted the West to stand by and not intervene we say that the intervention in defence political and with the sending of necessary weapons is absolutely shared by the Brothers of Italy and is necessary for our nation
THE RUSSIAN FdI Mr President in Office of the Council I would like to say at once that I appreciated your report for a patriotic opposition force it is not the first time but it is significant that in this case the Brothers of Italy have full support for the joint initiative of the whole Parliament and the whole nation in support of the Ukrainian people and their good reasons without whether or not That is why my thoughts go immediately to those who are fighting in Ukraine to the Ukrainian Armed Forces who have not surrendered and as my friend Adolfo Urso said before to the girls who are preparing with bottles of beer Molotov to the workers who contribute to tear down bridges and viaducts and dig trenches to families with children in the cellars and improvised shelters because no one thought it was so urgent to imagine in Kiev the existence of shelters A conscious thought of the turning point that this story represents for the world there is a first and there is a following Russia 's aggression against Ukraine We are faced with the need no longer to remove what we have removed for too long namely that war is not an impossible thing that multicolored flags are not enough that unilateral peace is not enough and less unilateral pacifism and that every day we must build peace knowing that war can exist It 's the only way to be prepared Today after Putin 's incredible act of Russia we have a much wider solidarity than we could have expected Putin's Russia probably did not expect a Ukrainian resistance to what was imagined as a lightning war such as I use a sad term the blitzkrieg He probably thought that as in Crimea we would find ourselves faced with the accomplished fact and then the reactions would be more disordered and less convinced It has not been so and this error allows us fortunately to think of how concretely to react with solidarity I said it a moment ago without if and without but and also with concrete aid for the needs of material survival but also military aid with defensive weapons that even yesterday in the encounter I had with the Ukrainian consul of Lombardy we were asked starting from the bulletproof vests and helmets extremely defensive elements which they tell us are the most urgent that Ukraine needs Concrete aid of course but also sanctions For once Biden who has some responsibility if only for encouraging with the shameful retreat in Afghanistan terrible actions like this he said the right thing sanctions are necessary because the alternative would be World War III We must be prepared to adopt sanctions which will also be a damage to us our families and our nation knowing that the government we give it a mandate will ensure that they are always fair and will not fall on one nation more than on another We also need to help Ukraine with different reception rules and not to change immigration policy which should be changed in the opposite direction In this case in the face of a real war and real reasons for a European people to flee from that terrible situation we call for all the necessary measures to be taken to abolish the bureaucratic mechanisms that could slow the arrival of those who want to come here to shelter themselves from the war and to work welcomed by friends There is no doubt that the consequences of this act will not only be political and diplomatic and will put us before a reality that we had removed but will also be economic and geopolitical You have already been reminded and I am grateful to you Mr Draghi of the absence of a national energy plan This is not the time to say 've we said 've nor to claim anything in front of those who given the need for a national energy plan always felt that it was a question of freedom and independence I am glad that at last it becomes a common feeling but we need to move on from words to deeds In fact there is no freedom and independence without energy independence Having abdicated our energy independence and put our needs in the hands of others no matter whether Putin or anyone else is something that needs to be rethought immediately even by reopening the debate on nuclear power I remember that the French nuclear power stations are on the border with our country and we would therefore suffer the possible negative consequences but never enjoy the positive ones I do not give the solution but I say that the matter needs to be re-examined I raise this issue which has been ignored I imagine deliberately in the first part of the debate although I do not have the sure answer As I said it is about our freedom and there will be repercussions in Italy but also in Europe I have heard for the first time in a convincing way of common defense Again I do not want to make demands on those who have always believed that thought should go to a confederated Europe with its firm point in defence international diplomatic policy and the defence of common energies rather than looking perhaps at the colours for food that have penalized Italy too many times This is the Europe we expect and want We want to move towards a European confederation that can defend the values of freedom democracy and independence of the peoples united by a common feeling and a history that has united them for good and evil In announcing the vote in favour of the joint motion that we have contributed to writing I say that nothing like the difficulties crises and tragedies can have as a side effect the strengthening of the common roots the awakening of the values that are sowed that make a people a nation and that unite the nations daughters of the same values historical and religious I believe that this awareness must guide us in the tragedy of Russian aggression making us say to one voice that we are all Ukrainians today
THE RUSSIAN FdI Mr President thank you for noticing my request for an explanation of vote Those who have been careful about the referendar results will have realized that on the first two questions the distance between the yes and the no has been very different from the one that has been recorded on the other three questions Given the fact that on the left those who voted did not vote no on all five we felt perhaps wrong that the no to the first two referendary questions expressed by Giorgia Meloni and the Brothers of Italy were heard by a part of those who decided to go to vote also because the polls showed very clearly that the Brothers of Italy was among the parties whose voters were most involved in the referendum compared with the same proposers On this amendment therefore we are strongly opposed and not for the reasons I have heard here not for the issue that my colleague has well expressed namely that they can be at least partially used instrumentally but because we believe that the matter of protective custody should be dealt with more deeply In other words not only should the text that is necessarily a summary of the referendary question we do not blame the proposers but once the referendum does not exist the way to change the issue of protective custody in our opinion cannot be sic et simpliciter equal to the referendary text so our substantive no to this text is reiterated with transparency However there is a contrast in this House also through the arguments I have heard to justify the no which makes us imagine that we do not want to deal more fully with this issue as the Brothers of Italy desires For example it surprises us I must tell the friends of Forza Italia that Silvio Berlusconi 's party votes differently from the League which proposed the referendum but which in history has always expressed itself more cautiously on this issue than on Forza Italia Brothers of Italy in reaffirming the no to the text and the need for a more in depth debate on the failures of the current legislation of the protective custody which has often created unnecessary suffering and which in other cases we consider absolutely justified does not want in this case simply to join the no expressed by the left and I have heard with which arguments nor to participate with a yes or a no to a strange division of the center right on this issue between those who also participate in the Government and towards both we respect We do not want in this case to divide and divide ourselves within the centre right on a subject on which we have a common underlying sensitivity that is to want to review it So Mr President although I am absolutely opposed to the text which is necessarily a summary of the referendary question we will not be taking part in the vote in order to stimulate a real and thorough debate on the issue of protective custody
Mr President after me Senator Fazzolari will explain more widely the position of Brothers of Italy I would just like to point out that in these days even in the press and in the course of television broadcasts the political party leaders are asking themselves an imperfect question asking whether we are pro-Russian or in favour of something else For Brothers of Italy the answer is very simple we are neither philorusians nor philokinesis nor philo Arabic If you really want to apply the concept of the thread which as Giorgia Meloni says belongs more to puppets than to political forces we are pro-Italian At this stage this means being without and without but in a position of accession to NATO and to the Western bloc There 's no argument about that However being led to safeguard Italian interests also means examining not only the position of today for which as the Minister has said with whom I agree we are certainly for the defence at all costs of the territorial and political integrity of the European States Ukraine at the head at this time We are also interested in understanding why we have come to this point I remember the story of not many years ago as far as Putin 's relationship with Italy is concerned of political friendship and not just personal friendship with Berlusconi which is known and on which it is useless to return But I remember George Bush 's America had a completely different relationship with Putin at the time so much so that we could then imagine that Russia could enter NATO and we forgot it while now in order not to have NATO on the border Putin is almost willing to declare a terrible war I am a convinced Atlanticist but the mistakes of some American administrations especially those of Obama and Biden must be strongly emphasized because they have dramatized the confrontation with Russia having facilitated and pushed Ukraine to the request to enter NATO Many years ago I was Minister of Defence and I remember that at the NATO meetings that I attended I expressed strong doubts about the action that had already begun to approach Ukraine or rather to promote Ukraine 's rapprochement with NATO until it got there It was clear that the advantages were much less than the dangers that this could have brought in relations with Russia Then there is the problem of the role that we have always raised This was well done by Senator Nencini perhaps mindful of his party 's main exponent Craxi who knew how to give meaning to the national identity Perhaps he was the first sovereignist of Italy Craxi for that famous story of which it is useless to remember the contours in which in front of the arrival of the American troops and planes put the carabinieri around the airport I wonder however why the European Union today cannot imagine a path which we have long hoped for aimed at giving itself a political role rather than a role exquisitely aimed at giving some form of different pressure to the national states on other matters We would like the European Union to focus on a common military policy a common foreign policy and a common fiscal line and then leave more freedom to individual nations On the other hand this time too we see the total absence of a diplomatic and geopolitical strategy for the European Union For us who are more pro-European than those who are pro-European in substance moments like this demonstrate the need for the European Union to evolve walk and go in a very different direction from the one it has followed so far I believe that I have run out of time and therefore remaining on the subject today on the agenda I repeat that if I look at the future of our nation and therefore of our children I see I imagine I hope and I want an Italy strongly linked to the Western world which knows how to hold to the values of freedom democracy and independence that someone would rather be implied

Perhaps not giving the government representative back for a majority member is a good thing
Mr Undersecretary in summary you gave a favourable opinion with a request for reformulation on a number of points I ask Senators Binetti and Fregolent if they accept such reformulations
The drama of written texts is that then it is more complicated to synthesize them
In the light of the opinion of the 5th Permanent Commission which you will certainly have followed very closely I would ask the representative of the Government whether the Government intends to incorporate the opinion of the Budget Commission into the maxi amendment
"Mr President before addressing the President in Office of the Council I would like to address my friend Pharaoh who has just spoken Too bad that the two thirds of his speech could n't listen to them even President Draghi who had gone out I imagine after the intervention of the League giving almost a signal of what has already happened I noticed a bit of despair in your speech Senator Pharaoh indeed a lot of despair I understand that the spectre of the elections the fear the ghost of this democracy are approaching Italians who choose become the fear of horror films for many in this House When there 's an election it 's almost like you 're hiding in the house and putting sandbags in the window things like that President Draghi you were very clear I would like to begin by addressing you now Sometimes I fear that this system dominated by the left in the aspects of culture the judiciary art and journalism will be so strong that even the freedom of the President of the Council to decide to resign She had decided to resign and then threw her by her hair and feet to get her back here after six days a record since we usually return after twenty four hours to have time to orchestrate the campaign we saw with 1,500 mayors out of 8,000 and 150 people and no more so what people in front of the Teatro alla Scala in Milan to shout Titì nun ce lascià recalling an ancient film by Nino Manfredi as my colleague Rauti did before You President Draghi have been corrected Although they forced her back here you said that without the popular vote it is no longer possible to have a government with you as President He said that without the popular vote he needs to have a large majority to continue Speaking of the latest events he also added that the majority of people have been fed up the desire to be together has been exhausted there has been the end of the pact of trust with the contrary vote of the Movimento 5 Stars and that it is not possible to minimize this fact These are his words to which I add is it possible to minimize what is already happening in this debate Perhaps you did not notice because you spoke that the only standing ovation during your speech to which we also associated is when you quoted Falcone and Borsellino For the rest I did not see any applause and I am pleased from the friends of the League and also but it was obvious of the Movimento 5 Stars Moreover there was no applause if not someone isolated from Forza Italia I understand that the President in Office of the Council has left the Chamber again because the games are played There is not that large majority that the President considered necessary in order to continue The League Leader 's appeal to a new government with whom Not with the Movimento 5 Stars it has correctly found the responsibilities and the hard contrasts between the center right that was to the Government and the left that said that it is not part of the pact of Government and therefore we speak of free drugs and immigration or worse we do nothing to decrease the taxes indeed The government is gone On the other hand is there anyone raise your finger if there is one who really believes that the interventions that have been and will follow in which we talk about the need to keep the Government alive for a sense of responsibility are sincere Do we really think that Italia Viva has as its first objective to keep the Government alive for a sense of responsibility towards Italians Do any of you really believe that the Democratic Party is not looking with despair at nearby elections that would not finally see it probably will the Italians decide the opposition Does anyone really believe that Does an Italian believe that Then I understand who is afraid abroad President Draghi There 's a song by Gaber that says I do n't feel Italian but luckily or unfortunately I am I think it 's a feeling not about the President of the Republic but about someone We Italians are It is clear that there is someone abroad who has reason to doubt that a change of government can be negative What is this reason To fear that a new government will not be clearly and compactly deployed on the side of the West on the side of NATO on the side of aid to Ukraine Brothers of Italy who will never enter this Government if there is a center right government can guarantee that it will be a government on the side of the West on the side of NATO and on the side of Ukraine 's defence President Draghi then what are the reasons why we insist on voting This is a simple reason If it were true that interrupting the legislature today creates discomfort on some issues but when in a few months time this parliamentary term ends will everything be done Or even in six seven or eight months there will be questions that would advise them to ask but how do they vote So what 's the system you like A system where you never vote A system says Ignazio La Russa with an election ban A system with a government appointed by the President of the Republic without a popular vote The situation will not be different from what will be in six seven or eight months Even in eight months there will be questions that need a government Another assurance which I regret President Draghi does not listen if Parliament is dissolved and the Government Draghi remains in office for the ordinary administration which has very broad boundaries when a large majority wants to define it as such Brothers of Italy will continue to make the patriotic opposition that it has done all these years If action is to be taken while Parliament is dissolved you know well that Parliament loose can work until the new Parliament is established and the Government remains in office until the new Government is born we will be patriotic opposition There is no fear of power gaps in a democratic system The power gaps are only in dictatorial systems a dictator died there is a crisis There is no democratic system Why do we ask you to allow us to vote again Why do we have this need No President Draghi It is easy to understand that if you decide despite everything and against the interest of Italians to continue for Brothers of Italy there is a continuing tendency to increase consensus We have no private interest in that this experience of Government continues indeed we are convinced that the good of Italy the good of the Italians is to have a Government son of a program presented to the electoral consensus a Government son of a coalition compact with a precise project We are convinced that the good of Italians is to have a Government son of the popular vote Let 's do it"
Colleagues as you know Maria Romana De Gasperi has failed His surname immediately indicates his ancestry Unfortunately this House wants to remember you I give the floor immediately therefore to the various senators who have asked to speak
We have thus concluded the interventions that have deservedly remembered Maria Romana De Gasperi
Mr President first of all I apologize if I asked you to take over from the Presidency I would have continued but I was pleased to speak even if in a Chamber that was not quite full I would like to thank my group 's colleagues who are still present as are other colleagues including Senator Gasparri The reason why I decided to intervene is because I wondered how it is possible that from here to a few minutes the government will have to put its trust in a measure that 95 98 percent of the Senate I do n't know what the exact percentage does not contrast and on which it says favorable Yet the Government on the provision will put trust which is an instrument that serves either when there is obstructionism or more correctly when the Government having within it opinions so divergent that it cannot be brought to unicum decides to say You vote for this measure through trust or resign How is it possible that in the face of the prospect of helping an assaulted country a bombed country a European Christian country which resembles us in ways of life there is today a need for a vote of confidence I do n't know or better I know too much It is also a question of aid which is justified of aid which is necessary and necessary for us too not just for Ukraine In fact there is a before and after Putin 's attack on Ukraine by Russia There was hope or you can say the illusion before the invasion that Europe could be a great economic power without having to have an international policy and a defence policy This illusion has fallen it 's gone We have war not at the borders of Europe but within those who want to be part of it also organically And then maybe it means that there is still someone who thinks it would be more appropriate to put some multicolored flags on the windows maybe make some rounds of peace and not send help or send only some blankets and not military defense aids that hold back a brutal attack and give a precise signal to those today attacking Ukraine and tomorrow could attack not only Georgia or Moldova but also countries that are an integral part of this Europe The other argument is that this debate has been joined not by choice of the Brothers of Italy but by choice of Europe of that Europe so declaimed by choice of our President in Office of the Council of your President in Office of the Council the issue of the amount of funding needed for defence first national and therefore European Those who understand that today European defence can only be the offspring of an adaptation of national defences otherwise they are stammering in terms of political knowledge And then someone wondered how it 's possible to think of increasing defense expenses to 2 while people do n't pay and do n't have the money to pay their bills Do you think we do n't know Look at the requests for measures that come from the right to help families businesses and traders What 's that got to do with anything Why equalize I quote because I am pleased because he is a person who esteems and is intelligent even if he is part of another party of the Democratic Party my colleague Zanda who a couple of hours ago said that Italy repudiates war as a means of resolving international disputes but considers you think he said it a member of the PD and I am proud to read it sacred the duty to defend the Homeland The debate on what should be the priority between spending on the defence of the Homeland and spending on social policies has always existed Governments prior to the present have increased and he says we voted in favour of the defense of our country despite having to face massive percentages of youth unemployment and then there was no war that is now there I would add that we spent a billion and a half a year dutylessly for fifteen years on international missions in distant places because even there we were going to fight terrorism Imagine if the need for a gradual increase in military expenditure to which Italy committed itself in 2004 2006 2014 and yesterday with Draghi and attention not only with Dragons friends of the Movimento 5 Stars with the vote in the Chamber of Movimento 5 Stars With the vote in the House of all parties Then someone said do you want to see that if we change our mind maybe we get back some votes from those we 're losing Then it 's a controversy they wanted to deal with us With us We have done nothing but reiterate what the 5 Stars the PD all the majority parties and of course the center right parties have done to the House what Italy has committed itself to in international fora and which today is compared to the needs of families and businesses Of course but do we not have those famous billions that must come from Europe for families businesses traders workers Have we not perhaps you have not read this proposed a further increase in European funds to advance rising military expenditure Do you know or do n't you know Then decide and if that is why today you force Italy to a figure like that of having to vote with the vote of confidence a measure that should be approved almost unanimously if not unanimously beat your fist and say mea culpa mea culpa mea maxima culpa Shame In conclusion for once we wanted to be able to forget that for us this is a government that if he had gone home earlier would have given the Italians the opportunity to choose one that thought one way or the other but in the same way We had decided to vote in favour of this measure but your begas force us not to do so not because we will vote against the measure but because you have turned it into a different thing into a vote of confidence to a government and the Italians have understood that it cannot be given because it does not deserve it
Senator you can rest assured because on real issues Parliament has always had attention This is an indiscretion and there will be spaces that the Regulation allows for any topic
Excuse me Senator Abbot how do you intend to vote ABATE Mixed I intend to vote against the resolution unlike the Mixed Group which abstains I speak on behalf of the Alternative component there is PRESIDENT The debate is closed I take note of that and give you the floor ABATE Mixed Mr President ladies and gentlemen if until recently the Committee on Agriculture it is true was working unanimously but on good measures and in favour of the agriculture sector since the government of the best has entered into force which is doing its best unfortunately I must say that this is no longer the case Beyond the fact that the use of water must be optimized and beyond the usefulness of the extension of the entry into force of the ecological outflow in relation to the minimum vital outflow that is currently in force the methodology that is currently being used is not acceptable In a measure that contains a common point in favour of the sector they stick wide meshes so that all kinds of speculation can take place In this respect the derogations which are ventilated and which can be implemented but which will be a certainty are absolutely not acceptable I am talking for example about those derogations that the regions can make with regard to certain waterways It is true that PNRR funds have not been distributed at all for needs while invaders and water management were necessary We preferred to give money to supply chain contracts at a time of crisis such as this or the food districts and we did not think about structural deficiencies and difficulties The water shortage at this time with climatic variations is structural I 'm also asking the Minister to review the funds allocated to the PNRR If we have to ask for money ask for it but we do not do serious and irreparable damage to agriculture and the environment That is precisely why I declare the vote against the Alternative component there is
THE RUSSIAN FdI Mr President I rise on one of our many amendments especially to explain why as the Group president has just informally said we do not withdraw these amendments We have no reason to withdraw them because they are all meant written and wanted in the interests of the citizens We would have expected that since they were all written thought and wanted in the interests of Italians and Italy the Government could not liquidate them with a simple opinion contrary to all the amendments in agreement with the rapporteur Mr President the sense of responsibility that moves Brothers of Italy on many occasions even important of internal policy and foreign policy the sense of responsibility of Brothers of Italy to the House and the Senate I believe gives us the right to imagine that we can at least examine what we think serves to improve these measures The quick definition that is useless that the opinions are all against that you look at nothing that you do not even ask for a remodulation that you do not need the opposition makes us not only confirm the presentation of these amendments but consider that these positions which you assume as necessary are aimed only at keeping the Government unduly clinging to the spit and not to the interest of Italy We shall therefore vote in favour of our amendments proud of your vote against and smiling at any abstention vote which is worse than the vote against
Thank you and the best wish I can give you is to have after those of parliamentary life successes in non-parliamentary life
Senator De Petris you were the most present in the intervention phase and we recognize your absolute record You have the right to do so DE PETRIS Misto LEU Eco Mr President this will be my last explanation of vote and therefore you will no longer be displeased to listen to me At the beginning of my speech I would like to thank you I spent long years here in the Senate during which I learned a lot and I really want to thank all the officials as well as all the staff of the Senate for me were teachers and guides I also thank all my colleagues with whom I have shared many of these years The decree law that we are about to convert today seeks as far as possible of course they are all quite partial interventions to intervene on a dramatic crisis which is energy and therefore social because of the combination of inflation and energy crisis These are measures that serve to cushion a situation and not to solve it so the social bonus is fine the stop to changes to the energy contracts the extension of the cuts to the bills the energy bonus to the enterprises the excise cut the 40 million for the local public transport that obviously has had an increase of costs There are a number of absolutely fundamental interventions I also think about the drought bonus and the state of emergency for water risk These are of course decrees of a government that is in office only for current affairs We have done our duty in Parliament and I also thank you for the work done over the last few days which has not been simple and complicated but has led to the improvement of the decree law in question and even though we have had to suffer until the last day to find a solution an indication as regards the superbonus I want to say clearly here that there has been an hostility on a matter that could have been resolved a long time ago as undersecretary Freni knows perfectly well I repeat on this issue hostilities have never been hidden A few months ago things would have been different if they had dealt with each other I say this at least by thinking of the anguish that we have produced in many companies that risked failure and by putting thousands and thousands of workers and their families on the road Is it a solution that solves everything No but it certainly gives you some certainty right now The other question is that of the school We insisted on finding a better solution until the last minute I have to say that in the end we have made changes which do not solve all the problems but which are a starting point for eliminating standards which in our opinion only harm school and teachers Having said that we announce our vote in favour and I renew my greeting I 'll see you outside the Senate
At the request of some of my colleagues particularly Senators Lannutti Castaldi and Calderoli I believe that the whole House is pleased to recall a figure who has accompanied our days for many years even those who before me were senators when I was in the Chamber of Deputies and who left us a few days ago Which one of you has no memory of Salvatore Biamonte 's presence at the buvette Who of you does n't always remember him ready to help each of us in the moments when we went to rest or chat sometimes at the buvette A figure who continued to be present in this palace specifically at the buvette even when he was retired even when he no longer received as I know a salary but only the pension because for him the Senate was his home his life He leaves a family with two children his son who works in the Senate to whom we offer our condolences and his daughter a doctor at the Umberto I Hospital in Rome who will ideally continue his closeness to the institutions which is humble but which sometimes teaches us more than many words Thank you Salvatore
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen I hope that we are at the end of the comics and I hope that this situation which the Italians have now understood to be carried forward only for the sake of perhaps some of us but certainly not of the Italian people has come to an end I would first of all like to address the parties in the centre right but in general to the whole of Parliament and all political forces so that we finally have the courage to say the experience of a government that has tried for too long to unite everything and the opposite of everything and the extreme left to those who believe in meritocracy liberal values and autonomy has ended What were the results They are the ones we see in the squares and numbers and we read in objective sources not in the words of a representative of the opposition To begin with and I address the esteemed and co-regional friend and colleague who preceded me Senator Conzatti as irresponsible is to continue with this Government which we must stress has seen the public administration 's debt to enterprises increased by 12 billion to quote a number So the so called Govern of the best was not even able to reduce the impact of the debt that is penalising the entrepreneurial system because the public agency does not pay Not only did he not reduce him and with a banker of Professor Draghi 's level we had some hope too who were and remain in opposition but he even increased it by 12 billion What is worse ladies and gentlemen is the answers that could be given in a decree law that in my opinion has the arrogance today to call itself a decree aid after which I will explain why I speak of arrogance We could use the tax currency which could be a prompt and immediate response to companies that are not paid by the public administration it could be a prompt response to companies that are in difficulty because the State the Regions and the Municipalities do not pay them Those companies that thanks to the Draghi Government have seen an increase of 12 billion the exposure could be granted tax credits in maturity even five years but allowing these credits to circulate which is exactly what you are not allowing the building bonuses At last I want to take it in word the Movimento 5 Stars decides today it seems not to participate in the vote that is not to trust the Government on a topic like the building bonuses on which the Government is mocking the Italians Even in the decree law under consideration as colleagues know very well on the subject of the transfer of tax credits and the tax currency is not being made the interest of the country they are simply following the things that are said under dictation outside this country probably from Brussels and the financial companies that have interest in maintaining a certain type of rating for our country that have interest in that our country does not grow and maybe to that the financial companies of our country not because they are less good but because they have a lower rating cannot compete in the management of savings with those coming from outside our country maybe Germans and French In this way our savings are not managed and used in Italy but abroad These are therefore the answers that the Government and Professor Draghi must give not to the Brothers of Italy who are asking him but to the Italians who deserve to listen to them Do you really believe that Article 14 of the Decree Law helps solve for example the problem of 60,000 Italian companies that are about to fail because of the inconsistent and persevering position of the Government on the subject of superbonus The Government in fact on the one hand seems to give an opening and say to reopen the circulation of the credits allowing the banks with Article 14 to make an extra sale to the VAT consignments It is therefore allowed to the banks who do not buy more credits therefore the enterprises are crippled and the citizens are desperate to free their tax drawer and therefore to start again That would be the logic that any thinker might have Instead this Government on the one hand inserts Article 14 but on the other hand it happens at the same time comes out a circular of the Revenue Agency who knows who inspired according to which the assignee that is the entrepreneur who should buy the credit is responsible for the goodness of the credit itself You understand very well that first of all this is a forecast that does not serve because upstream there is a visa of conformity of the professionals therefore the activity of the banks and the insurances that have obviously verified everything therefore to pretend that a simple entrepreneur who does not do the work of the banker neither the State Controller or the official of the Agency of the income in buying the credit is also held responsible for what happened upstream means with one hand to give an opening and with the other to establish a closure then to make fun of the Italians Would that be help ladies and gentlemen Who says this government really believes that Italians have slices of ham on their eyes Do you really believe that 60,000 companies 500,000 workers and the about 5 million Italians involved in the superbonus have slices on their eyes and believe in your nonsense and your teasing We can always move forward on what you have the courage to call decree law aid There are tax credits that you recognize but by chance last week and it is not a coincidence because we of Brothers of Italy do not rely on the case we questioned the Government to ask how those tax credits should be treated The government has told us that they are on the same footing as non-refundable state aid so it means that we will overcome the ceiling so those companies to which you have recognised and recognised tax credits will have to return them to the state a further mockery I could then Mr President talk about tax credits in the energy sector In paragraph 3 b of Article 2 you linked the tax credit to the de minimis so in fact these companies will not take anything because with the de minimis they will not have the right to take this money This is another mockery I do not think it is an opinion these are objective data Starting to conclude because it seems to me that time is coming to an end I would also like the Government to give some answers to Italians and maybe even to us I of cognitive deficiencies will certainly have many We are waiting to hear from the government about fuels why fifteen years ago the cost to the barrel of oil was higher than today but the fuel cost considerably less You have to explain to us why today we are teasing Italians even at the petrol pump This is not the way to run a country We all have a whisper of dignity I ask you with my heart let us send Parliament before the voters let us give the country a coherent and loyal political majority that can finally govern and not make fun of this country"
"DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen after the draft competition law and after the bill of admission despite so many bad forecasts we have also arrived in advance at the adoption of the draft law on the reform of tax justice I address the parties that have done so much terrorism in recent months on the risk of elections we have come to secure the fourth instalment of the PNRR We concluded in advance the approval of that legislative component that was necessary for the fourth instalment that of December of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan We have concluded with the coherent effective and constructive contribution of the Brothers of Italy Group which always having the national interest at its centre never thought of putting itself out of the way when objectives were or would have been to be achieved So we have arrived ladies and gentlemen I would therefore also like to address the communication experts and those who outside this House have stormed us for weeks and they have done so in recent months saying that those who wanted the vote were irresponsible and those who wanted a Parliament finally expressing the Italian people and perhaps a Government expressing a more legitimate Parliament were irresponsible because when the Chambers had dissolved it would have been the end of the world nothing would have been approved and the PNRR would have skipped The conclusion as we have always said and as Giorgia Meloni has always said is that there has been no legislative paralysis and no institutional paralysis that we could continue to work as we have worked and as we will also work in September bringing at the same time the Italian people to say which Parliament wants to represent it and which will then be or will have to be the government that will take its lead and will take the country outside the sandboxes which all too often this legislature has instead provoked I would also like to know where those owls are who have hidden behind Professor Draghi 's esteemed professional figure in order to hide their inability those political forces in contradiction between them who however hid behind the figure of Draghi and who perhaps even today without their legitimacy and probably without permission hide behind the flag of Draghi to propose to the Italians an alternative that does not exist You have tried to avoid the elections behind the figure of President Draghi and today illegally I repeat because I do not know that you have been allowed you hide too many behind the figure of Professor Draghi to hide a lack of program and homogeneity that homogeneity that we in the center right have already achieved and that program that in the next few hours we will explain to the Italians because yes we are a coalition ready to govern the country Entering into the substance of the bill I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this point first of all the President of the 6th Commission of Alphonsus the undersecretaries Freni and Guerra who have supported us and all the colleagues who have loyally collaborated with us to reach this goal which could also be achieved in a more concrete and substantial way More could be done however we have done so and that was what mattered even for the considerations that I explained in the premise We of Brothers of Italy are very proud dear colleagues to have placed an element in particular as essential in order to allow the measure under consideration to reach the goal today I am referring first of all to filling an iniquity that prevented graduates in economics and commerce from accessing the roles of the tax judiciary It was something shameful which went against the interests of the citizens because we all know that tax commissions or tax courts as we will now call them are called upon to decide on business and business issues on which therefore economic business and tax competence was essential It was therefore unthinkable not to foresee the presence of graduates in economics and commerce Since the first day Brothers of Italy has placed this as an essential element to proceed and fortunately for Italians and for all citizens this has been accepted so we have come to a positive acceptance of our amendment The same reasoning applies to an amendment which has made it possible to clarify and those in the sector understand this the value of the dispute In the area of jurisdiction of the monocratic judge we have provided that because of the value of the dispute the virtual value should be taken into account otherwise the loss would have put the risk for the monocratic judge of having to decide on disputes of much higher value than that which can be referred to his field We are equally pleased to have obtained an agenda One of those acts that governments often disregard but this time who knows why we are convinced that the next Executive will not disregard the agendas of the day that have been approved therefore those approved in this context have a far greater weight because I repeat that whoever will take the reins of the next Government or at least we hope that it will will give them immediate enforceability the day after its establishment I am referring for example to a measure which is highly requested by the regions and the self governments on the facilitated definition of local taxes because in accordance with the principle of self government which at this stage has not been accepted as an amendment but as an agenda we want to allow the regions and local authorities to be able to reduce the amount of taxes and taxes due to them when taxpayers are ready to pay to solve the previous tax problems which already existed This is therefore a rule that has been requested of us by the Regions to which we will deliver it when we are given the opportunity to do so Further useful and important amendments have been adopted on the subject of pending disputes which will certainly be widened taking into account also what is happening at the Court of Auditors in accounting justice where there are no limits of EUR 50,000 EUR 100,000 or EUR 200,000 but there is the possibility of resolving disputes in agreement when the parties want to do so We will also move in this direction to solve the serious problem of the clogging of the magistrates So we 've dealt with some issues others we 'll deal with in the next legislature and we 're sure the government that 's gonna take care of them will have our consent Mr President I am abstaining because we did not want to put obstacles in the way We tried to improve this measure we would have expected more We had asked and this is one of the causes that leads us today to abstain that finally at the end of the hearing the device should be read and that the sentence be filed within fifteen days The agreement could not be reached so let us refer this to the next parliamentary term as well I shall conclude therefore Mr President with the hope that this will be a step forward and we are convinced that it is not only in order to obtain the funds of the PNRR but also in order to give full time as has been said to the tax judiciary therefore a greater guarantee to the interlocutors and investors who are approaching our country We are sure however that more needs to be done we need to make further improvements just as we need to do a real tax reform in the next parliamentary term Brothers of Italy have been seriously proactively consistently in this political phase by the opposition I believe that there will be even more force and seriousness in the next legislature"
Mr President ladies and gentlemen another piece of the PNRR should be in place Another piece that this time had caught me with a little more confidence than the usual government activity When my colleague and leader in the Commission Senator Ruspandini informed me that this time there is no confidence I thought that at last the words of President Mattarella and let us quote with much less importance the repeated demands of the opposition for greater involvement of Parliament had taken effect In this particular case they have had it which we welcome and hope will be a good hope for the continuation of legislative and parliamentary activity Analyzing everything however we are then faced with a delegation law that is really a delegation in white it is yet another delegation in white that Parliament within the framework of the puzzle of the PNRR entrusts to the Government A blank delegation which I would like to call double Parliament gives a blank delegation to the Government and the Government allow me to play a game of words gives a further delegation to the Council of State It is not very simple it has not been so in the past either and I believe that those who at parliamentary level are older than me have rarely seen such a phenomenon they have rarely seen a Parliament delegate the Government and then in turn the Government de facto delegate another body of the State to carry out its functions When we then check in this case with the utmost esteem and respect for the Council of State that this delegation is given to a court who understands some of its procedures administrative acts contracts notices and tenders some problems if it poses it both from a political and democratic point of view because the excess of delegation is never positive and from the point of view of the final result In fact to put in the hands of a judge a path that should not only guarantee legality and so far the judge is fine but also the practicality and the enforceability of the works the fact that it really can then be transformed into concrete works as the PNRR must bring to the system where there are the needs of the companies to sburocratize and simplify with all respect for the courts I think it is a risk it was opportune indeed it was necessary not to give exclusively to a judicial body the function of delegation Instead one could share a path where the Government while maintaining the direction and role shared with judicial technicians but also of the enterprise and the private this iter That is why my analysis of the path was positive in the first instance at least until I saw that trust was not placed Even this time I can't completely calm down I am faced with a delegation and in addition with a delegation in white which is a double delegation with the intervention of the Council of State Mr Minister allow me as an opposition which certainly does not want to pre-constitute criticism but to try to make a contribution of proposition and improvement to give you a signal It is okay not to resort to trust but let us try to involve Parliament and the Government to a greater extent in the roles they play On the substance of the provision may I refer to a passage that we have certainly shared I am referring to the ban on uniting lots a matter which in fact has often prevented our small and medium sized enterprises from working This is a positive aspect that we certainly agree with As Mr Ruspandini will say better in his explanation of vote however we would have liked to see much more about the aspects of simplification deburocratization and speed in the concrete implementation of the works that the various notices and contracts must then guarantee We would have liked the majority to be more open to the role of the opposition more open to the proposals that the opposition always with the seriousness that we would like to distinguish exercised in the Commission Let me give you an example of the amendment to avoid the exclusion of small and medium sized enterprises which had some problems with the DURC or non-final fiscal irregularities In fact let us always remember as an accountant that the findings of the Revenue Agency are not a mantra but the opinion of a party that must possibly be accepted with payment by the taxpayer or contested and judged by the judicial bodies Therefore until the act of ascertainment becomes definitive to me that I am a liberal that act has no value In contracts a small and medium sized undertaking which has an act of verification is excluded This is unacceptable We had therefore asked for remedies especially for those companies which may not have been able to pay and are perhaps also the victims of investigations because of that public administration which does not pay them what is due Therefore a double mockery they are excluded without having definitive acts and the possible irregularity is due to an irregularity of the State the Regions the Municipalities and all those public administrations that have not paid them Minister you will understand that accepting that amendment by Brothers of Italy would be an act of justice towards the Italian system and not a favor to a force of opposition We are in general discussion and I would also like to reflect on the other reforms integrated into the PNRR on which we would also like to see a different attitude from the majority and the government Let us think for example of tax reform in that case too a law of delegation and we also see that the Government wants to maintain absolute control so that we can then we have to tell ourselves and tell the citizens and voters who listen to us legislate through delegated decrees on which Parliament can only give an advisory opinion Therefore heavy delegation on the reforms of the PNRR In the context of tax reform a topic that is making many talk and angry many is the reform of the land registry Mr. Minister beyond what you think of course your thinking is as legitimate and as important as mine you cannot tell the Italians that you are doing the reform of the land register but you do not increase taxes Maybe they wo n't increase tomorrow but if you do the reform of the land register even a fifth grader understands it sooner or later unfortunately more before then taxes will be increased further In this way we will go to penalize even more those Italian citizens and pensioners who perhaps with the liquidation of thirty or forty years of work bought the garage the apartment for the son or the sea We will go to penalize even more those Italian savers who have tried with all their strength to save and instead of being rewarded are discouraged with more taxes This is not how we solve the problems but at a time when the state 's coffers are already in difficulty and even more so are those of the citizens because of the energy crisis that is hitting them in a brutal way Beyond words the various decrees bills and supports have not given answers to today Mr President allow me a few more seconds to remind you of another serious element I believe I am not the only one in this House to receive daily cries of grief from poor people who would like to pay their debts to the State I am referring to the breakdown b and balance accounts and excavations These citizens would like to pay but last year in December they were asked to pay for what had been suspended for a year and a half because of the lockdown Now they are asking and I am asking you Minister to reopen the terms immediately because we must ensure that honest Italians can pay what they owe and want to pay which is also in the interest of the Erario and the Italian State
"DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is not easy to speak at such a dramatic time for the whole world We are talking about a ridiculous decree and I will explain why I make such a statement while there is a risk that this night a potentially global war has broken out and unfortunately in a context in which our country and Europe have proved themselves and are proving absolutely absent Well in the midst of all this we are discussing a decree on which yet another confidence will be placed and which comes to the attention of the Senate Assembly in the indifference of a Parliament that has become accustomed Only a few days ago my colleagues I remember that only the Brothers of Italy Group actually engaged in the general discussion of this measure said that we would arrive at the imposition of the question of trust and so it was while the President of the Republic had asked the Chambers and of course the Government for a renewed role of responsibility The conclusion is that all those who have filled themselves with joy and have peeled their hands for the words used during the election of our President of the Republic have only allowed a few hours to go back to the vote of confidence So vote of confidence general debates that are deserted explanations of vote of which as happened a month ago written texts are delivered without even being read and announced in Parliament The role of our democracy tends therefore to be more and more assimilable to a form of parliamentary government to a form of subjugated parliament with a government that comes here simply to have a formal authorization to proceed which is not the one for the magistrates but the one that we are asked to give in this case On the subject Mr President I would like to say that only the Brothers of Italy Group can claim to have succeeded in doing something good to the House of Deputies I would stress this in the House because here in the Senate we have not been able to analyse the measure even in the Commissions I would remind you that the Finance Committee of which I am a member has not even expressed its opinion even as a form of unanimous protest because there is no longer even the time and the way of working I certainly express and in any case my personal solidarity with Mr D'Incà because I believe that no Minister for relations with Parliament has had to make certain figures for so many times I personally pay tribute to him for my solidarity but politically the bitterness for what is happening is truly profound We of Brothers of Italy are proud to claim to have obtained the extension for the lowering of the ceiling of cash which therefore for this year does not go up to 1,000 euros but remains to 2,000 euros it would have been really demential at a time when our tourism and our trade are suffering having to ask all this to foreigners who already do not come to Italy because we ask for the green pass and go instead rightly to countries smarter than ours which despite everything perhaps have less problems than we and in which the green pass is not required Not only that therefore with this measure we also make sure that those foreigners go shopping abroad perhaps in neighbouring Austria where they can use the cash without having to resort to other means of payment The result is therefore proudly claimed by the Brothers of Italy while the Government I believe has very little to claim Mr Steger who preceded me spoke of the psychological bonus On the substance I agree I would miss it with a government that has made DAD a philosophy of life and that unceasingly has continued with absurd green passes which are useless as demonstrated by themselves I share this bonus but I was not allowed to present the amendment that I would have liked because of the imposition of trust I would have liked to propose that the cost be borne by Minister Hope since the psychological bonus is to be charged to the political inconsistency of those who wanted to manage the pandemic in this shameful way It is not the citizen and the general taxation who must assume the cost of the psychological bonus but it must be the Minister who unceasingly with the approval of the Government has remained in his place continuing with a health policy that throughout Europe has no equal for closures and restrictions with damage to people otherwise there would be no need for the psychological bonus and the economy as we have seen But it 's not enough What have you done gentlemen of the government on the subject of energy As I said we are at the door of a war that risks being global The energy problem is very serious In our country there has been no energy policy for years nuclear energy cannot be named even if we buy it from the countries that produce it and we do not even have to extract gas because this seems to destroy the environment So no gas After that however companies are no longer able to compete on the markets and families will probably no longer be able to warm up I would like to understand from the Movimento 5 Stars if the TAP pipeline should also be closed Do we also want to stop the gas coming from Africa At least I remember that the position of the main governing party was to close the TAP for the passage of African gas In the same way I remember that the first party of the Dragon Government is against the regasifiers So no gas to store Where then is the government of the best What is the energy response we give to our country and Europe Where do you want to go These are the questions that a citizen an entrepreneur and an Italian industrialist ask themselves and whose answers they would like from their own government On the other hand the psychologist 's bonus comes on the charge of general taxation to remedy the damage of Minister Hope No gentlemen of the majority you have not put together the Government of the best you have put together everything and more to keep the chair something different from the Government of the best The government has failed in health care and is failing in the economy and does not have a strategic vision in energy policy which is crucial at this time The government if it had to talk about extensions had to remember instead the extensions of financing and guarantees for small and medium sized enterprises And none of that I shall begin by concluding Mr President by returning to the issue of energy Since you are all pro-Europeans in words perhaps we are in fact no one has thought of looking at Europe which has renewed its concessions to all hydroelectric power companies We do not however do so with the result that our hydroelectric companies have not made investments for years because logically they cannot count on the time to be able to amortize them This means that our companies that produce and produce energy not investing actually have 30 to 40 less than hydropower production potential In summing up and concluding thanks to those who are against gas we find ourselves with 30 40 billion cubic meters of gas that are not extracted in the Adriatic and a 30 40 percent of less energy production because of the missed extensions which we do not do while Germany France and other European countries do It is a shame and we are tired Mr President I would like to address the only representative of the Government who has remained in this Chamber tell President Draghi that this cannot go on"
"Mr President I would like to start with a positive note because I think it is right and proper to do so I am referring to the fact that even with a distance of three months from the budget law 2022 approved at the end of December the Government finally intended to follow up on the commitment it had made with Brothers of Italy when in the tax decree law a demanding agenda was approved binding on the budget law I would like to point out and emphasize to extend the terms of the break up b and balance and cancellation So three months later the government finally wanted to respond to this commitment We note this in a positive way Therefore it is a small and important piece which finally gives an answer to over 500,000 honest Italians who had been asked to pay in a month and a half what they could not evidently pay in almost two years of lockdown It is regrettable however to have to say that despite the amendment of Brothers of Italy despite the original agenda of Brothers of Italy the first party present in this Parliament the Movimento 5 Stars has tried to appropriate this in the main national newspaper It is indeed a fall in style which should not characterize those who make politics and sit in institutions As Mr Damiani acknowledged in his report for which I thank him that was an amendment by the Brothers of Italy And I repeat that a party in addition to the first party present in Parliament is appropriate in the first national economic newspaper I 'm really sorry Sorry that ethics and fairness even in the harshest political confrontation should belong to each of us So a positive note which however is covered by an act of wrongdoing that we did not like We are sorry I repeat and I stress that Having said that let us get to the bottom of the real problems Mr Calandrini the leader of the Brothers of Italy in the Budget Committee has been quite clear in denouncing in fact how this decree of support has only the name but certainly not the facts or in any case the facts are very few We are in fact in the midst of a financial storm due to Article 27 the problem of tax credits The government already has a thousand problems to solve we understand problems related to the pandemic the political energy crisis the international crisis that has aggravated all the other crises Well in all this marasma the government has found a way to put into crisis a path that of the building bonuses that was virtuous that we all thought virtuous He did it in an inconceivable and absurd way I repeat truly inconceivable and absurd Even the correction measures then identified in the so called bill decree did not actually serve almost anything I 'm used to talking about facts too In these hours I have received confirmations also from my region of certain data I can tell you that the current situation not in a financially weak and poor territory but in Trentino which is a consolidated and structured reality is as follows today the main banking realities have exhausted the plafond of use Banca Popolare di Sondrio ITAS Assicurazioni primary Italian insurance competitor Mediocredito Banca di credito cooperativee di Verona e Vicenza coffers rural and other national banks Unicredit and Gruppo Intesa are in the process of being exhausted This is the fact that you are failing You were wrong In the decree law supports you have done irreparable damage to the system and in the decree law bills you have not even been able to repent and to put back on track in a correct way the path that characterized the bonuses and the superbonus What 's worse is that whoever gets into this is the whole country It is the Italian companies the construction companies the construction companies the financial companies that had worked in the sale of the credits the citizens who find the yards blocked who cannot move forward and who at best today thanks to your measures Mr Undersecretary are in fact having to sell the credit and therefore take much less than what the State invests More than 110 percent We are moving towards 60 70 percent when it 's okay because in most cases today they can't even bring home a euro Then the measure under discussion should be called decree law support Someone might object that there have been fraud Of course there have been but certainly not in the princely measure that was the superbonus because in that case there was a very simple norm that actually stood I am referring to the visa of conformity professional ope ligis obliged to insurance that countersigning a practice guaranteed its existence in fact fraud in the superbonus does not even reach 1 The fraud took place where the government left the doors open as they say in the bonus facades where there was no control Does the government need the best to predict that if there is a weight relief if there are state tax credits there must be a minimum of control I therefore wonder why you continued to insist on taking action by restricting the transfer of credits You did not have to intervene in that area because the sale of credits had nothing to do with it as the 110 measure shows You simply had to understand that the credit must be identified at the origin must be traced on a financial platform in its passages and must be accompanied by a visa of conformity With the passages of identification origin X and Y particle traceability of the transfer path which can therefore be infinite if moved on the financial platform and visa of conformity the government would be protected would protect the Erario would protect the citizens and would avoid waste Instead despite the fact that with its constructive opposition you have always said so you have decided to limit the transfer of credits which is of no use but to destroy a measure I therefore appeal to the political forces that are in the government that sit in this Parliament and that I am convinced feel the same way as I do about this It is not enough for them to say it the way we do it because we have no other means than to be able to speak except sometimes to be expropriated even of our work You are in the government you have a duty to change these things You have a duty to put an end to the destruction of certain measures Rather have the courage to say that they are all cancelled because this would be an act of seriousness it would not be shared but it would be an act of seriousness We cannot destroy a measure by creating barriers to art or even by doing so in origin I believe that there is bad faith by not providing for control measures and therefore determining fraud which were predictable and which however today are used to oppose the tax currency the transfer of tax credits I repeat therefore that there has been bad faith Starting with the conclusion to take up the words of my colleague Calandrini and many arguments carried out also by other political forces the present decree law supports will not support almost anything or very little We need a revision of the PNRR which is no longer current and we also need another one linked to international crises we need a budgetary deviation and we need real energy policies On these issues we would like the Government to be judged on these issues we would be happy for the Government to be labeled as the Government of the best we would be happy for the opposition because it would mean that in that case our country and our fellow citizens would have the answers they deserve but unfortunately today it is not so"
"Mr President I would like to speak on the subject of the PNRR by splitting the reasoning into macro and micro-economics I start from the reasoning about microeconomy and I am referring to the first two aspects that each of us should have in mind when thinking about the PNRR I am thinking of the local authorities and I am addressing above all those colleagues who like me live in peripheral situations and are close to the problems of the small municipalities which are the great wealth of our country and know very well how difficult our local authorities are encountering I repeat in the effective achievement of the results of the PNRR I believe that each of you at least once has been called by mayors and local administrators concerned that with their own structures they are unable to respond to the PNRR 's calls and sometimes cannot even fully understand their prospects The first question I have to ask the Undersecretary and the Government is then what is really being done because we are not at the beginning but we are in the middle of the PNRR 's activity There 's no way that so many administrators still do n't know where to bang their heads This is the first point that the Government should keep in mind if it really cares about the good result and especially the good transition in the economy and territories of the investments that could be produced by the PNRR The other sector which is obviously connected to it is the construction sector because we know very well that all infrastructure depends on and is linked to the efficient functioning of the construction sector I would like to open a parenthesis then to remind you that this sector is dying that it is suffering greatly from another lack of government that is the fact that the tax credits linked to the building bonuses are blocked We have dozens of companies that have put workers in cash dozens of companies that can't pay for suppliers dozens of companies that risk bankruptcy And I am sure ladies and gentlemen that like my phone and my computer they are overburdened by the cries of pain of Italian companies and artisans in the construction sector even yours cannot but be equally attentive And what is the government doing Do we really want to kill the heart of Italian construction and then think about realizing the PNRR projects and infrastructure when we no longer have companies Will we take them from France perhaps thanks to those who have privileged relations in France Is that what we want to do Otherwise it is not explained how to combine the blockage to the enterprises through the cessions of the credits with the realization of a PNRR that obviously demands an Italian building capable of carrying out these works The theme is the relationship with SMEs We were taught by the Marshall Plan in the 1950s that a national and international investment plan is effective when the private sector is involved How did you involve our SMEs and when did you involve them They 're in exactly the same situation as those mayors on the outskirts who do n't know where to bang their heads There is another wish that I would like to address to the Government move because time is no longer there I would therefore pass for the sake of time to some reasoning in macro terms I would like to remind you as Gustavo Piga brilliantly explained in an article in the magazine Il Libero Professionista that the provision of PNRR funds is linked and conditioned by fiscal compact Let 's go back to this bad word which has penalized Italy so much for our passivity in previous years Well the fiscal compact that is the famous 3 in the debt to GDP ratio can still condition the disbursement of the funds because Article 21 of Regulation EU 2021/241 the one establishing the recovery plan before the PNRR provides for a suspension of the fiscal compact but this is not normal So today we 're going to be back in the fiscal compact if the government does n't act immediately and we risk due to the obvious impossibility of falling back into the parameters of the fiscal compact to see us block the financing of the PNRR I therefore suggest to President Draghi to read Gustavo Piga 's article and to deepen what the freelancers are emphasizing and screaming moreover in the usual carelessness towards the category which is now a habit Again on these issues what are we going to do about the issue of the economy and inflation Are we going to follow the path of monetary policy as in the United States where inflation comes from an excess of demand or do we think we are going to change strategy because inflation in Italy and Europe is not due to an excess of demand but to a supply shock because of the increase of raw materials So a monetary policy of austerity serves very little indeed creates stagflation We would like to have some answers on this point from Minister Franco and President Draghi we do not agree to move Italy towards the policy of stagflation but we are asking for development policies and therefore we are asking for action with a view to employment I run because I see that time is running thin and I move on to a brief summary to remind the Undersecretary and the Government that the first results of the PNRR are certainly not exciting It also says The Messenger these days talking about the flop of employment centers We should in fact guarantee 16,000 jobs in employment centres so that those receiving the new employment social insurance NASPI and citizenship income can be given work They are therefore 16,000 people to be hired thanks to the 5 billion euros of the PNRR but the Regions have hired only 3,000 of them with a frightening delay moreover in a country that first does the measures that is gives the money and then creates the tools that should have anticipated the measure If for the income of citizenship the employment instruments had previously been envisaged I repeat and only once they had been active had they been expected to be paid out it would have been a reasoning on which one could be confronted The opposite is the case and even with PNRR funds we are not able to hire the professionals needed to create jobs Let 's remember therefore also looking at the simple numbers provided by the Government that in the two years 2020 2021 that is in the last two years the Government of the 15 billion euros of expenditure expected has spent 5 and therefore we have a rate of absorption of the funds of the PNRR that is a third of the planned Would this be the Government of the best which has planned 15 billion euros and spent 5 billion euros in the two year period 2020 2021 according to official data As regards the prospects I welcome the fact that this morning Mr Cingolani finally gave a clear answer on the subject of gas and said in answer to my question in 10a The Commission has finally realised that national deposits must be recovered I am pleased better late than never as I said in the Commission In the answer however the government also says that there is no investment that we must invest to reopen the wells that is not easy because we lack we have deficiencies and we have maintenance to do I would like to ask the Undersecretary what we are doing to ensure that PNRR 's money flows into those gas investments but I am also thinking of rare lands lithium and the great mineral deposits we have in Italy I therefore ask what is being done to invest in the direction of energy autonomy which would be a first response to the geopolitical crisis not to give resources to those who want to wage war such as Russia Mr President in conclusion this would respond above all to the need to give Italians businesses and citizens the energy they need Mr President representative of the Government let us therefore make these investments and try to be more effective than unfortunately despite the constant warnings of the Brothers of Italy Group the majority has been able to do"
DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President do I take the floor after two opposition speeches or am I mistaken Mr Marino We have heard what should be a majority force to do an intervention on trust that really seems to include a further political component among the oppositions to this Government What I want to stress is that Parliament 's crisis is becoming increasingly marked here today and that it is defining in a very worrying way almost a conflict between parliamentarism which is the basis of our Constitution and those who on the other hand to the Government in a hierarchical and autocratic way interpret the way in which they play their role You see President today we are having to discuss trust in one of the many decrees law those many analgesic decrees that are responding to the drama of this period and we are doing it with the forty ninth if I have n't hurt the accounts confidence So we 're about to get to 50 trusts something unheard of and unacceptable I would like to devote at least a few seconds of my speech to some positive aspects But before entering into the substance of the provisions that Brothers of Italy managed to obtain in this decree law I want to thank those who put their faces on us I would like to thank the Presidents of the two Commissions Senators Girotto and D'Alfonso who had to put their face on a path of work that has seen Parliament de facto deported as I shall explain its role My thanks also go to the two Undersecretaries to the Undersecretary of War and to the Undersecretary of Freni who took part in the confrontations in the Commission and tried to give a moment of comfort to those parliamentarians who see themselves expropriated of their role You must know but the Italians must know that to support this Government that is to give the vote of confidence to this Government as colleagues are also going to do that in the explanations of vote not to say in the statements outside the Chamber express the greatest criticism of the Government means to remember that the parliamentary committees are not able to carry out their work We arrived here on Sunday afternoon at 6 p.m. full of good will leaving our families to work and modify a government provision We stayed until 3:00 in the morning in Commissions 6th and 10th gathered to try to do this Well we started working and at that time we began to vote on amendments which in fact were not even made known to us Normally it is required that there are at least 24 hours to be able to work on the amendments Instead the rewordings arrived in fact at the time of the vote Therefore Parliament has been deprived of its role I would like the President of the Republic as an expert and defender of the Constitution to give a signal because it is unacceptable Mr President that the Commissions and Members of Parliament cannot do their job Learning about reworded amendments when we have to start voting means that we cannot do our job or at least vote on the amendments not out of knowledge of them but perhaps depending on whether they are the majority or the opposition That would be enough ladies and gentlemen to explain why Brothers of Italy confirms as it has done since the beginning its no to this Government which has really laid a tombstone on the role and functions of our Parliament This however is a decree law that also from a technical point of view expresses its own inconsistency We must remember Mr President that the cover of this decree is absolutely sloppy and inconsistent But we know we have also read the comments that everything is at risk of appeals because you are using the taxation of over -use that in itself can also be an acceptable and acceptable thing at a time like the current one but only so long as you actually tax over -use But when in order to tax over use it is shown that it does not even know the most basic rules of accounting that it does not even know the difference between profit and the taxable VAT and therefore perhaps we end up taxing excise duties when the Government of the best Mr President taxes excise duties it means that it understands nothing about accounting it means that it does not know the VAT law That means he 's making fun of the Italian business system These are the covers Then however when Brothers of Italy responsibly appeals to the majority asking that to cover measures of importance and weight for the development of the country consider the tax feedbacks of the norms the Accounting tells us that we cannot Thus cover may be used which is likely to be rejected by the bodies of jurisprudence and justice but tax feedback cannot be considered This is what the government of the best is doing This is Parliament 's mockery but even more so than the Italians Nevertheless Brothers of Italy tried to remedy the inconsistency in the content coverage and form of the decree trying to bring to the analgesic provided some positivity For this I thank my fellow Members who have supported us I thank the President and the Undersecretaries who as I said before understood the frustration of Parliament and also the constructive and proactive motivations that a political force like the Brothers of Italy wanted to bring in its criticism to a measure in the interest of the country We are therefore pleased and proud to say that thanks to us we have come to a measure that allows us to retrodate the effects of the postponement of deadlines for illness and injury of professionals at the beginning of the emergency Covid and therefore at 31 January 2020 thus covering those who were at risk of sanctions for having fallen ill in the first year of Covid which is the worst We therefore thank the Government for accepting this commitment We are proud to have obtained an extension in the evaluation of the notices of irregularities from thirty to sixty days of the deadline to pay or contest the notices of irregularities of the Revenue Agency responding to requests from both employees of the Agency and fellow accountants and therefore of taxpayers we are proud We are proud and I appreciate that also Senator Marino president of a majority force said this in his speech to have obtained that the fuel bonus is extended to all private employers and not just to companies However we remind the Government that companies are not the whole economic world and therefore now also professional studies will be able to enjoy this bonus I conclude Mr President by reminding the Government of a commitment at least that and I address the correctness of the Secretary of State for War a demanding agenda has been signed for the Government in the first useful decree on energy to reopen the research and exploration of gas in order to achieve energy autonomy It was a commitment that the Government made with Brothers of Italy and with Italians to restore certainties to their future We hope that that commitment that the Government has made without if and without but with us and the Italians will be respected I conclude in the light of the arguments put forward with the denial of the trust of Brothers of Italy to this inconsistent and almost ridiculous analgesic provision for Italians
DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President for an exponent of the Brothers of Italy who before being a majority or opposition party is a political force that has the values of the Homeland in its DNA it can only be an honor and a moment of emotion to take the floor to express its vote in favour of the establishment of a day that must recognize the role that the Alpine Corps has had and continues to have in the history of Italy When we talk about the Alps Mr President we are not only talking about a body one of the main pillars of the Italian Armed Forces but also about a reality that is a pillar of civil protection a reality that today is almost fundamental in determining the solidarity that unites the Italian people This is the Alpine Corps these are the Alps And so says a senator who did n't make the alpine who was n't lucky enough to be an alpine but he has an alpine father a father of ninety nine years still alive who could glorify himself with the presence in the Alpine Corps I am part of a territory Trentino Alto Adige in which the feeling of brotherhood towards this military body is really important For us the Alps have always been beyond politics and even beyond age a reference point I believe that in our valleys in our countries in our territories there are opportunities to be confronted with the solidarity of the alpine young and old When we talk about the Alps when we have to recognize the role that the Alps have in the history of our country we certainly refer first of all as well highlighted in the bill to the battle of Nikolajewka a battle that as someone before me said was not only heroic from the military point of view but it was a battle that really allowed many Italians to gain esteem and respect regardless of the historical moment in which they lived So this is an acknowledgment that history must bestow on the glory of the Alpine Corps The Alpines are represented by a simple symbol but recognized by children of all ages the black pen which can be declined in the brown or white color of the generals which is one of the symbols of Italianity next to the tricolor I really believe that the Alpine pen as a symbol of this country is surely recognized in a cross-cutting way A symbol that approaches the motto of the Alps a motto that we must remember to ourselves to every citizen The motto This is where you do n't pass We must reflect on what it means on the topicality of that motto today as then today as tomorrow From here one does not pass it certainly indicates the defense of the borders of which Brothers of Italy boasts I remember especially to those who exhumed the tricolor during the World Cup of football that defense of borders means defence of values it means defence of traditions it means defence of the heritage of our fathers That 's patriotism This is the love of homeland This in fact represents the defense of borders Defense that the alpine have always exercised with honor and glory and deep respect for the opponents But defense of borders also means something else it also means the confrontation between good and evil and knowing always be on the side of good When there are calamities when there are tragedies when there are pandemics since we are living unfortunately also this epoch in those moments the Alps are there because this means in that case the defense of the borders This means that we do not pass from here This is n't where the evil goes this is where the negativity does n't pass The alpine is a bulwark of good The Alpine bulwark of solidarity the Alpine bulwark of our values We must remember this and we must remember this every January 26 because it is a debt we owe to all those soldiers and to all those soldiers who in the past as in the present defend our territory and our values Mr President I conclude with a current and political reflection From this point of view we should start by reconsidering compulsory military service a military service that could give many young people a definite commitment of course to training Of course we must not go back but we must re-evaluate a service that allows our young people to acquire civic awareness and enable them to feed that chain of solidarity represented by the National Alpine Association which is unfortunately falling in numerical terms for the ageing of their members but that each of us knows how important it is in the chain of solidarity We can therefore also draw political reflection from the recognition of their role and of this important Day
Mr President Minister Brothers of Italy draw the attention of the Draghi Government and the Minister to a topic of great importance our businesses and our citizens are broken by the pandemic the energy crisis and the international crisis They need immediate answers and not further problems So Minister with regard to energy the tax credits that have also been provided for in the recent Ukraine decree for companies that need energy and gas are certainly acceptable But Minister we are calling for an improvement both in terms of the percentage of intervention and the duration of this intervention and of greater accessibility to the measure But above all Minister we are talking about a very serious issue which at this moment is in danger of really blowing up as they say many Italian companies I am talking about the issue of limiting the transfer of tax credits This theme today brings together the credits of building bonuses the credits of the superbonus 110 and the tax credits recognised for the energy crisis This limitation Minister believe me does not help to reduce fraud and is penalising the whole of our country It penalises citizens who today are unable to move forward to see their work finished and who often have credits in their belly that they can no longer give up because no one buys more They penalise companies which are no longer able to find banks that buy credit from them because of restrictions on the circulation of credit So we 're facing a risk of failure Minister I have almost finished but I really do ask you and the Government to speak on these issues immediately I repeat loudly that when there is credit traceability the identification of the credit and a financial platform on which they run to which are added the visas of conformity of the professionals at that point it makes no sense to provide limitations to the transfer of the credit We really hope Minister with strong energy on your part to change the path that has led is leading and will bring alas serious problems to our country We do not want to restrict the sale of credits but we obviously ask for checks for all bonuses as evidenced by the fact that in the superbonus 110 there were no frauds With those checks in the superbonus 110 there will be no fraud in the other building bonuses or even in the energy tax credits PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Dr Franco has the right to reply to this question for three minutes
Mr. Minister unfortunately I must declare the absolute dissatisfaction with an answer that I feared but that I hoped could change There is no objective reason and I say this again Minister to persevere in error You are persevering and you are doing this in front of 60 million Italians in the error of predicting limitations to the sale of the credit which are of no use because in the superbonus 110 fraud is practically reduced to zero At a time when there is a visa of conformity where the professionals who apply it are insured and therefore liable to the State there is no risk of fraud The limits to the sale of credits lead to a single result Minister to paralyse the market Today the ceiling is sold out Poste buys only from private individuals and the main national banks have exhausted the tax capacity and do not buy I 'm asking you to really think For the good of the Italians put an end to the absurd limitation in the transfer of tax credits
Mr President we are also here today and we will alas be talking about one of the many reforms connected with the PNRR in the coming weeks and months I would very much like to be able to call them reforms and unfortunately we are faced with agreements agreements made by a majority which even a young boy with the first arms in civic law would understand in order to contemplate everything and the opposite of everything every time he has to make compromises downwards Nor do such compromises often express the will of the parties that support the majority who often come under the dictatorships that are likely to come from Brussels My colleague Mr Calandrini said this earlier but why do n't you look around You talk so much about Europe then look what they do in Spain In Spain the beaches are protected because they consider the beaches of goods and not services Look at what they do in Germany and Austria where hydro- electric concessions are constantly being renewed by whistling bans We Italians on the other hand obviously have to suffer the Brussels Diktats and immediately put the concessions to competition expropriate the beaches To do what To make more efficiency and competition No it 's not exactly that You see our tourism has always looked at the specificity of our country Always look at those bars those beaches that are characteristic of families expression of Italian individuality Well you will want with the new bans put coasts bathrooms bars and restaurants of our beaches in the hands of the multinationals You would like to have many Nestlé many equal structures that no longer identify a origin and a territory but represent only an interest and above all an interest that comes from foreign countries That 's what the National Emergency Government is doing The emergency is what you are causing with this Government which I repeat no longer represents as a parliamentary force the majority of Italians and which moreover no longer represents the forces that support it forces that do not have the courage to give it distrust because they know very well that they will go home This is the dramatic situation in which we find ourselves Instead of making C series reforms I would then like to make a proposal to Deputy Minister Pichetto Fratin whom I esteem and who I know that on these issues he thinks like me and at the same time I do it to the friends of the League who certainly did not have much satisfaction in their first Count government in approving citizenship income Let 's make a reform that finally meets the needs
DE BERTOLDI FdI I repeat therefore the invitation to Deputy Minister Pichetto Fratin for the Government to have the courage to go beyond half reform I am thinking of the reform of the tax system Mr Vice Minister a reform that is disgruntling everyone and that is why it is not being done I am also thinking of the reform of public works contracts There are many reforms therefore because perhaps with some artifice they convince Brussels to grant the quotas of the PNRR but they do not convince and do not serve our country Brothers of Italy will always be with Italy with the Italians with those Italians who want to work and with those companies who want to get up at 5 in the morning and work to grow our nation We invite the Government and above all that part of the majority that would belong to the centerright to take note of it and to give a turning point in the sign of the efficiency and effectiveness of a country that looks ahead and teaches young people and future generations that we can still make it that we can still be protagonists but we do not want to be passively assisted The money
DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President I would like to draw attention to the issue of professionals because this amendment seeks to equalise the position of freelancers with those of other economic operators Therefore I believe that it would respond to an act first of all certainly of fairness and also to the spirit of what should be as you well know for us it is not a true reform for competition At least being able to equate the liberal professions for the purpose of accessing the calls for funds and funding with other economic operators by equalizing the registration of the Chamber of Commerce with the registration of professional bodies would be a necessity for this category and an act of justice and equity by Parliament against those professionals who as we know are all too often ignored and considered to be B series compared to other professions and VAT consignments I would really like the Government to be able to give a favourable opinion on this amendment and that parliamentary colleagues who like me when confronted with professionals show their attention vote in favour of this issue in order to equate freelance professionals with other VAT matches
DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President it is enough to look at Article 1 which contains the spirit of the law in which we talk about competition in order to understand that the freedom of discount for traders the freedom to choose when to make firm and promotions is a principle that should not be affirmed as is the case today with ambiguous subterfuges and behavior a principle that should instead be guaranteed by the law unequivocally If you really think of doing a reform for competition you allow entrepreneurs in a liberal way to decide for themselves how and when to do promotional activities
DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen at a time of crisis such as the current one in which we all fear that inflation the international crisis the pandemic crisis can also increase crises in banking relations and the further presence of NPLs deteriorated credits at a time when we should all make sure that we protect our entrepreneurs artisans and traders as much as possible I believe that approving this amendment would be an act of civilisation first of all towards those entrepreneurs who are in difficulty As is often the case and the businessman knows this it is possible that the current accounts may be cross border We call for the only borrowing rate to be that applied to the current account and therefore there are no extra rates no trespass rates At an ordinary time it can also be understood that it is a precautionary measure but at a time like this we must tell the craftsmen and traders that Parliament is united and favourable in asking that the banks apply only one rate on the border or outside the border of the account I therefore appeal to the forces that are said to be liberal and close to business to vote for an amendment of civilization
"DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President I must say unfortunately with a certain custom that this time too we have faced one of the least positive features of this parliamentary term that is to say monocameralism which is now high in principle We were faced with a decree law which in the competent Commission the Finance Committee in which I have the honour to participate did not even have time to examine it arrived but in a few minutes we had to fire it to bring it to the House today Therefore not only monocameralism not only contempt for the tasks of parliamentary institutions but in fact also a failure of any attempt and will to improve as should be done this decree law We have been forced to table amendments in this House that we would have liked to table and debate in the Commission but that was not possible We have tabled them in this House Mr President and we have obviously seen for the sake of time reject all our proposals Entering a little bit on the subject we note that this measure the so called simplification decree is actually another omnibus decree which contains a little bit of everything and in fact comes to be a sanatorium for irregular immigrants Article 43 paragraph 3 in fact represents a suspension of proceedings on illegality and illegal immigrants and is accompanied by paragraph 6 again of Article 43 which provides that in the face of a simple application the offence is extinguished and the residence permit is actually obtained So in a simplification decree law you also introduced a sanatoria on immigrants it does not seem consistent or absolutely agreeable For this reason Brothers of Italy with its behavioral logic could never have voted in favour of such a rule A rule that represents I want to emphasize discrimination against those immigrants President who apply from their home who have not violated the laws who have not wanted to make illegals who were waiting to arrive in our country on the basis of the decree law flows So we also discriminated against honest immigrants against illegal immigrants This is what is contained in the so called Decree Law simplifications a provision that had nothing to do with this argument Mr President many things could have been done if it were to be simplified Just turn around any professional studio talk to any entrepreneur with any craftsman how many simplifications you could do Brothers of Italy as I said had tried to make a further contribution in this direction with the amendments tabled I would like to mention a few here because we cannot think of criticizing without explaining what better could have done For example with reference to Article 3 I believe and I think so many of my fellow accountants who are listening to us can only share that we could simply repeal the periodic VAT clearances In e-invoicing the State has all the elements available without having to ask for further compliance from companies craftsmen traders small and medium sized enterprises and of course their consultants That was a simplification to eliminate the periodic VAT clearances by Article 3 We could also mention Article 9 where you have provided in my view also correctly for so called systemic loss companies for the repeal of the rule that provides for comfy companies so you have given relief to those companies that are at loss not because they like to be at loss but because the crisis of recent years makes it possible unfortunately with some ease to go to loss in at least two of the last five exercises You have therefore removed from the absurd discipline of comfy societies this type of society but I believe that an act of greater simplification would have been to eliminate the whole path of comfy societies I remind those who are not of the profession ladies and gentlemen that the rule provides that companies are taxed are obliged to declare revenues on the basis of a percentage imposed by the State percentage for example on real estate ranging from 4 to 6 percent so we expect revenues that are supposed to be there If they are not at that level they are being taxed in a clearly presumed way A simplification especially at a time like this was not only to turn to companies in systemic loss but to extend the path to all societies of convenience I quote another amendment proposed by the Brothers of Italy I am thinking of repealing at least for the construction sector of the so called reverse charge that is the reversal that occurs in VAT which in fact constantly creates problems for our small enterprises which not applying VAT are serving VAT upstream the one that they must reduce This leads them to go to credit and to have to ask each time refunds that come late in time enough to force them to resort to bank credit in order to meet their liquidity needs So why did n't you simplify by eliminating the reverse charge at least in the construction industry which is so heavily affected by it as by other measures Another step of real simplification would have been for example to raise the limits of the flat rate Why do you continue to maintain at 65,000 euros the flat rate that could be raised to at least 100,000 euros You would have made life easier for many small businesses that have serious difficulties You did n't On the other hand Mr President the logic of taxation has always prevailed of suspicion towards the enterprise those logics which perhaps in the tax delegation contain the land register and therefore the desire to create a parallel income and then clearly create the conditions for taxing the assets of Italians the houses of Italians or perhaps predict as the Secretary of the Democratic Party Enrico Letta a further capital tax on inheritances in order to create further welfare towards young people Perhaps instead it would be enough to use other sources of income to give young people job opportunities according to the principle more work less taxes as proposed by Brothers of Italy The more you hire the less you pay taxes in this way you give an answer to young people without work not giving them a tip perhaps electoral since we are in elections and proposing on the other hand to create a tax that maybe would penalize so many young people who have inherited some assets but who do not have the income to support and be able to pay the tax These are the proposals of a serious party of a party like ours I would also like to refer here to Article 40 c Let there be a question from Brothers of Italy who highlighted how you in the previous decree with a hand gave the tax credits to companies in difficulty who have to pay the gas and energy at high prices but then applied the European de minimis and you went to remove them I remember that you have put this right thanks to a question that in recent weeks Brothers of Italy presented Also in Article 40 c you gave an answer to the problem of the transfer of the credit on the superbonus Finally say what Brothers of Italy have been telling you for months about the previous decrees you cannot have the limit of May 1st because obviously with this limit you did not free the tax drawer of banks and insurance However when you listened to the Brothers of Italy you planned to make a first circular of the Revenue Agency which makes the assignees responsible for the claims against the truthfulness of the credit itself making them jointly with the banks So you canceled the effect that with one hand you had granted Mr President for these and for many other reasons Brothers of Italy will not be able to vote in favour of this decree and we will commit ourselves with the Italians to really doing simple clear reforms in the next legislature and in the interests of all our companies"
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen I believe that the day we are going to live today and the decisions we are going to take could finally turn this country into a turning point I am sorry that the President in Office of the Council has now absent himself but I am addressing his ministers and I am addressing the Government I make a reflection Brothers of Italy makes a reflection after listening to the words of the President of the Council a very clear reflection The President made a clear contradiction on the one hand he reiterated that this was a government that was once called national unity on the other hand he confirmed in fact and I will prove it that this is a government that is direct and determined by the Democratic Party Why do I say that ladies and gentlemen I say this because the President in Office of the Council has clearly struck the so called centre right of government he has referred to issues such as the land register the Bolkestein directive taxi drivers talking about it in an irritated grieved way he has ignored the sentiments that the centre right part of the government has brought in these months On the other hand the President of the Council has made no reference to the divisive elements in his government that have been bullied by the Democratic Party in recent weeks I have not heard a word Mr Draghi about the legalization of drugs about ius scholae I did n't hear a word and maybe these were n't divisive themes And then a government of national unity as we have called it certainly cannot be based on a party that is carried in the palm of hands and on some political force which moreover is majority which instead is almost ridiculed in its own behavior and in its own demands One thing is clear President Draghi you have made a field choice perhaps I do n't know you are preparing to go on the field with the Democratic Party but at least we will be happy to discuss with you on the issues of economic freedoms meritocracy ethics Christian values that inspire us We will be happy to deal with you and with the arguments of the left but at least we will have clarity at least the Italians Mr President will say which side they want to be on Mr President in Office of the Council you said that you must stay because the Italians are asking you it is very serious what you said Mr President because in democracy it is not the appeals of someone who counts but as Giorgia Meloni said it is the vote of the Italians that must be respected not the appeals of some area And as for the mayors I want to say thanks to that clear majority of mayors over 6,000 who have not signed any appeal because they have respected their citizens A mayor represents all citizens even that majority of the country strongly opposed to such a government So what are the Italians Ministers and President in Office of the Council who are asking you to remain in the government Certainly not the majority as is certainly not the majority of Italian mayors I want to make some other considerations President let 's talk about responsibility For a few days we have read the newspapers the whole so called regime press with the big newspapers the televisions the news the opinionists with the Rolex on the wrist who come to talk to us about responsibility but what responsibility I also address President Casini with affection and friendship what responsibility Brothers of Italy tell you what responsibility is I remind the mainstream that if we decide to go to the vote we have a month of election campaign because in August the Chambers are closed So we 're gonna have a month of campaigning while you guys prefer to do nine months of campaigning You would like for your responsibility to leave Italy in the election campaign for nine months in which the Democratic Party will talk about ius scholae ius solo and the legalization of drugs the center right will instead say its thesis mocked as it has mocked it just today President and Italy will remain blocked and firm Or Mr President in Office of the Council you should clarify that a little better Today he made a list of emergencies he spoke about the problems of the country that we all know and that above all believe me know the Italians pensioners who do not arrive at the end of the month those who see the bills doubled the workers of those companies that thanks to the mess you made on the superbonus are home without salary There are 60,000 businesses that are failing at the Ministry of Economic Development MISE there are 170 crisis tables and the only ones solved I think are the Venetian ones solved by our Councillor Donazzan thanks to the commitment of those who really believe in work and politics So Mr President either you think you can solve all these problems in September having failed to resolve them in a year and a half of government or perhaps a government elected by Italians and citizens should solve them Or perhaps some of you I happen to address the Democratic Party believe that a government elected by citizens is not entitled to resolve the emergencies of the country Do you think that having on September 26 a government finally expressed by the majority of Italians it is not legitimate to solve the problems Perhaps you want the Italians to believe that the Government even in that month in which it would not be in full power could not carry out the activities of ordinary administration that is to issue the decrees that also serve for the PNRR You know very well that you can work until the new government is installed Then read the Constitution since you mentioned it so much work but give the word to the Italians because from early October we will finally have a Parliament expressing the will of the people and a Government finally expressing a cohesive parliamentary majority The majority will be center right we are confirmed by all this ardour all this assault that is coming from the consolidated powers those powers that for years have not won the elections but that for years badly administer the country for the Italians and well administer it for themselves Here the comparison is between the real responsible that it is us between those who really want the good of the country and those who instead want the good of their armchairs and who maybe want to arrive in May to make a few hundred nominations of state This is the discrepancy and Italians know it they are not fooled by the empty words that are said We are proud to be responsible because for us the responsibility is declined by giving the floor to the citizens and the Italians they and they alone I am going to conclude Mr President will decide who will have to sit in the scans and ministries in which you now sit in my opinion not representing the country Long live Italy"
DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President to mention the figure of Maria Romana De Gasperi for some thirty years is a reason not only for special honour but also for reflection and emotion For all those who were born in Trentino the De Gasperi family and Father Alcide have always been a cultural ideological and behavioral reference When we think of Maria Romana De Gasperi we refer to a figure far from secondary in the history of our democracy In paying tribute to and expressing the deepest condolences on behalf of the Brothers of Italy Group we want to remember how important Maria Romana was a daughter who was able to be at the side and at certain times in the shadow of her father and a person who knew not to seek the protagonism but precisely for this reason to be the protagonist of the cultural and political life of our country We owe her so many cultural moments She was the founder and honorary president until her death of the De Gasperi Foundation a foundation that collected all the documentation on the cultural and political history of Alcide De Gasperi a man of the other century who lived not only at the turn of time but also at the turn of a historical reality that saw our territory pass from belonging to the Habsburg Empire Austro Hungarian to the Italian State De Gasperi lived as a protagonist in the two phases of belonging to Trentino to different worlds and different historical realities I would like to recall the figure of Maria Romana as a witness to all the moments of her father 's life for example the moments in which her father represented the rebirth of this country its democratic and liberal rebirth He represented a strong barrier in the face of the drift of communism in the post war period which risked bringing Italy into a situation certainly not suited to the wishes of the Italians De Gasperi in the post war years was the barrier to communism he represented the liberal and Catholic democratic values that led our country to the years of economic development and boom Maria Romana 's work has been much appreciated by all of us because she has been able to testify to the role that her father had for our nation for our citizens and for the values that we all want to embody today in our political activity and in our daily life I would also like to stress the commitment of Maria Romana to remember the figure of De Gasperi as the protagonist of an autonomy that let me say was partly betrayed after her death De Gasperi conceived the regional autonomy that autonomy of the Trentino Alto Adige Region that had to give perspectives to a peripheral mountain territory which certainly also had problems of coexistence And he gave it to him because De Gasperi 's regional perspective also following the De Gasperi Gruber agreements I start the conclusion was decisive for our Trentino The Trentino then recalls the figure of Maria Romana and Father Alcide with the utmost respect and with the utmost mourning We turn to the family to express our closeness and our thoughts
Mr President I would like to speak very quickly to address my colleagues in the centre right who we believe are and can still exist We therefore ask you ladies and gentlemen to vote in favour of amendment 1.12 which corresponds to what you say and which we say when we are dealing with voters It is a precise precise and clear amendment according to which in the context of tax reform measures should be taken to reduce taxation on households and businesses and to exclude from tax delegation the revision of cadastral export We ask that we show that we are consistent at least on such strong issues We therefore vote in favour of this amendment in order to reduce the taxation on households and to prevent the revision of the cadastral bans Those who vote for it will be consistent Of course we are asking the whole Parliament to be consistent but we are asking our centre right allies in particular
Mr President after an electoral week after a moment that almost no longer belonged to us namely the confrontation with the electorate we should have rediscovered a value of democracy that is to say the confrontation with the electorate and we should therefore have learned also a heritage of mutual respect which we would always hope when we have some optimism should also improve parliamentary work and restore dignity to Parliament which unfortunately has not lost it but lately does not even try to win it back I will explain this point It is precisely in this context that we must listen in the last few hours and I am speaking with respect to the many esteemed colleagues of the Democratic Party to the words not of a city councilman but of an important MP of the Democratic Party the foreign head Mr Quartapelle in Martelli who referring to the Brothers of Italy and his leader Giorgia Meloni spoke of the Rantolo della Meloni Meloni I remember that in the dictionaries just open them the word rantolo means the breath of an agonizing person He even added and perhaps if he does not clarify it immediately he will also respond to the law that what considered today the first Italian party would be part of an international financed by Russia Mr President I believe in democratic rules in the respect of citizens and voters and in the cooperation between political forces and I expect immediately some words from the Democratic Party that will clarify exactly whether Mrs Lia Quartapelle 's ramblings in Martelli belong to you or to the Democratic Party
Mr President I do not think I have offended Mr Quartapelle as much as you offended the Italian right Giorgia Meloni and the voters of what is now the first Italian party I therefore apologise if Mr Quartapelle 's husband has been considered to be inappropriate so I withdraw him and call him Mr Lia Quartapelle a member of the Democratic Party I turn however to the Democratic Party and ask for a statement of clarity with regard to the Brothers of Italy because we do not accept such attitudes towards us I speak in this House as much as I want I turn to a political party represented by Mr Quartapelle You 'd better abstain
"DE BERTOLDI FdI There 's no doubt about it We are talking about a further reform so they want to call it of the so called Government of the Best which unfortunately and unfortunately I stress is once again yet another downward reform I believe that no one in the so called majority and even less among the opposition parliamentarians is satisfied with the reforms we have had so far and I am thinking of the so called reform of competition the tax reform that is not even moving this reform of the procurement code and public contracts because they are not reforms They are small compromises someone slightly improved someone else absolutely useless someone else even harmful that bring nothing to our country I am talking about these things with professional colleagues with businesses with those who find themselves every day confronted with issues such as the greatest downside or the most economically advantageous offer I would like to point out for example that although the transition from the maximum decrease to the most economically advantageous offer dates back to 2016 and therefore to a few years ago the fact that it has been well presented in recent days Inarcassa i.e. from the National Insurance and Assistance Fund for Architects and Engineers is that still today most of the race commissions penalize the concept of the most economically advantageous offer and in fact it is still possible to award on the basis of a 40 50 percent reduction In terms of score the weight of the component relative to the most economically advantageous offer is well below the specific weight of the decrease This was an opportunity to express a clear word to give clear feedback on these passages and instead also on this little or nothing When we talk about downside I also think about numbers To quote a few numbers I would like to remind you that the projects completed late those projects that cost us so much from all points of view when referring to the reality awarded with the low down are 34 percent when instead you have with the maximum down we reach 66 and therefore double The number of disputes and we know what this means even in terms of costs for our communities where there is the highest drop it goes from 13 to 88 so it grows four or five times What do I mean by that We had above all you had as a majority the opportunity to have a heavy impact through this text on elements of this kind You had the opportunity to radically modify unequivocally and instead continue on a tracked road which did not bring great results despite the reform of 2016 Perhaps it is necessary that politics cooperating confronting helping abandoning the culture of suspicion which has led to always seeing negativity risks enemies even criminals in their counterparts and therefore has weighed down the bureaucracy as well as the work of the mayors and administrators making it almost impossible to make decisions without the fear of being incriminated We have created the conditions for work not to be done and procurement is a difficult sometimes unworkable and extremely risky passage for those who have to oversee them We would have liked more attention to be paid to these issues by the Government and the majority I would like to make a brief comment on another passage that I think is important also underlined in the recent conference in Inarcassa which I recall being the National Welfare and Assistance Fund for Engineers and Architects i.e. those who are an active part of such paths I am referring to fair compensation in contracts and tenders that issue which even in Parliament remains suspended because we do not want to complete it Even in public works contracts it should become a precise and precise reference because fair compensation means quality performance It 's not like that As we do not want to approve after years the law on fair compensation which could be done in just a few weeks in this area of Parliament we did not want to make it very clear that fair compensation must be a right for professionals who benefit not only those who work but also those citizens who demand valuable works works and projects made by trained technicians and therefore well paid in a fair and fair way There is another subject which I would like to mention and which has not been implemented I appeal to all of you who have practiced craft manufacturing and service companies operating in the world of procurement how many companies perhaps public sector creditors are excluded from invitations to tender for tax or social security irregularities We are talking about companies that would have all the requirements to be able to participate in public tenders and are instead excluded not because of their fault but because they may have paid late 5,000 or 10,000 euros of VAT and therefore have an irregularity even if not because of their fault I repeat but because they are some of the thousands of creditor companies towards the State the Regions and the Municipalities that is the public administration Therefore the public administration that excludes them from the invitations to tender is the very cause of the irregularity in which they have incurred In conclusion Madam President this is the reason why we of Brothers of Italy and I refer to the initial part of my speech would like to be more cooperative we would like to be heard and to be able to compare ourselves on the basis of the respect and trust of the entire country of our community We would like the problems of our country and our economy to be solved together On the other hand unfortunately sometimes one prefers to make insulting and useless polemics rather than to go to confront on the merit that as I said is always important basic and fundamental"
DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President I was pleased to hear the words of my esteemed colleague Mr De Petris when he spoke of rebuilding what happened And who more than Brothers of Italy does so and with great pleasure I could list at least 10 speeches which contain the considerations that have led us today to adopt a single and united amendment on this subject at least 10 times in this House and as many times in the Commission Brothers of Italy has called on colleagues from other political forces to put an end to the absurd blockade in the transfer of appropriations that were not objectively standing A block that the Government has repeated and continued for months supported also and above all by the Movimento 5 Stars that was its first political force And then out loud we say well finally you also realized that that bond was to be removed because in the superbonus there were no scams because it was evident that with the visa of conformity of the qualified and insured professionals there could not be scams as it was evident that the banks carried out an investigative activity in the acquisition of credits Despite this despite the fact that the many interventions of Brothers of Italy and myself on this subject are in the archives a year has passed in which we have blocked most of the works in progress This is simply an objective demonstration of truth and it is obviously a reason for complacency because finally the rest of Parliament also realized that Giorgia Meloni and the Brothers of Italy had seen us just for months but unfortunately the Government Draghi has been supported on this issue in a truly unacceptable way
DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President I begin by thanking my colleagues and the structures of the Senate for the cooperation of these years synthetically I want to emphasize that also in the decree law in question we have seen the characteristic of the Brothers of Italy Group For four and a half years including this phase we have been a constructive serious opposition which has tried never to obstruct but to improve as much as possible the legislative production of this House both in this House and in the Commissions Of course we would have expected even more from this decree-law By the government that has been called the best and I think this adjective will probably be used very rarely we would have expected some strategic vision We would have expected perhaps Mr President that alongside the due and due bonuses and aid to businesses and citizens obviously not enough but we are waiting to see the next measure too there would be some hints of energy policy We would have expected answers in relation to national gas fields For months Brothers of Italy has been at the ribs of the Ministry and the Government asking for it to start again with the extraction of national gas nothing even in this decree law The same can be said about thermo-towers There is no mention of any prospect even of clean nuclear power Basically we see the immediate content but nothing strategic of that strategy that this country needs so much Surely if the Italians give us the chance we will be able to demonstrate in the first days of the next legislature that we will carry out paths of strategy and of energy and industrial policy for the growth of the country As far as the subject of the superbonus is concerned Brothers of Italy expressed appreciation as I said in my previous speech after pressing for almost a year the majority in parliamentary committees and classrooms saying that it did not make sense to prevent the free movement of tax credits and limit the tax currency which is still one of the strategies to avoid the country 's indebtedness and for the future Well we have said this and repeated it for months and finally in this decree law that was born in the electoral campaign the entire Parliament in fact complied with the requests of Brothers of Italy Maybe if they listened to us a little earlier if maybe those who supported the government of the best had listened to us today we would have fewer companies in crisis and fewer construction sites blocked In the light of all this I would have appreciated from the Government that in the face of these serious mistakes it had granted at least an extension today to 30 September for the achievement of the 30 of the work in single family homes It was because of that blockage to the credits that crippled the system The government had to extend it and despite our pressure it did n't grant it Brothers of Italy I repeat has been constructive it has brought its own contribution but for the reasons mentioned above can only abstain in the face of the decree law in question
The next item is the debate on document XVI No 10 on the question of whether the Senate should promote conflict of attribution between State powers before the Constitutional Court with regard to acts brought in the context of criminal proceedings pending before the Turin Court against Mr Stefano Esposito The Junta decided by a majority to propose to the Assembly the activation of a conflict of attribution between the powers of the State pursuant to Article 134 of the Constitution against the competent judicial authority The report has already been printed and distributed I would ask the rapporteur Senator Cucca whether he intends to supplement it
Since no one wants to speak in this debate we shall proceed to the vote on the proposal of the Assembly for elections and parliamentary immunity
I would like to point out that the Council 's proposal to raise a conflict of attribution against the Turin Court in criminal proceedings against Mr Stefano Esposito was voted by a simultaneous ballot The vote was followed The Senate approves See Annex B The Presidency therefore intends to give a mandate to one or more lawyers in the free forum
Mr President even if we interpret the thinking of the rapporteur Senator Santangelo we will give up our replies if not to say that the work of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure has been carried out further At the end of our work all the amendments that were adopted were unanimously voted on as was the unanimous mandate given to the rapporteurs I would therefore like to make the possible explanation of the amendments and express my opinion on them
"Mr Calderoli rapporteur Mr President I would like to make one point When I mentioned amendment 2,302 I wanted to refer to the amendment in the text reworded by the rapporteurs as tabled"
Mr Calderoli rapporteur Mr President first of all as we approach the conclusion of our work I note and I thank you for that that in an hour and three quarters this Senate has revolutionized a regulation for the second time in my opinion not only with numerical adjustments but also improving the functioning of the Senate Then we stop at what are proposed almost as religious battles Personally I am completely alien to the battles of religion because I do n't believe it but I think there is a principle of common sense that must be used whenever something is done I have made an assessment of a first version of Mr Maiorino 's amendment which directly introduced important amendments into our Rules of Procedure which I do not think can be dealt with in a forum like this because they should be contained in a Rules of Procedure something As rapporteurs and as a Junta we have expressed a favourable opinion on a reformulated text which I want to clarify why the speeches both in support and against do not correspond to the content of the amendment The amendment aims to include an additional article whereby the Presidency Council then the next one sets out the general criteria it does not just say how to amend the Rules of Procedure so that in the institutional communication and in the activity of the administration it is ensured that the gender distinction is respected in language i.e. by avoiding the use of a single gender in the identification of functions and roles while respecting the principle of equality between men and women I heard his friend and colleague Schifani say that it is right to leave the freedom of choice I am voting for this amendment precisely in order to leave the freedom of choice because today if I use a single genre I have already established that the other genre cannot be used So I want the President to call himself the President if he likes him whether he is a man or a woman and the President woman calls herself the President I would not be the President in my case because I will never be the President Everything is then entrusted to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure which will make proposals which will return to the House for possible transposition into the text of the Rules of Procedure of what we have stated in general terms So we do n't do religious battles and move on
The next item is the debate on document IV No 10 which contains A request for authorisation to use conversations and telephone communications with Senator Armando Siri in the context of criminal proceedings pending also against him transmitted by the court of Rome section of the judge for preliminary investigations and preliminary hearing on 17 September 2021 The Assembly 's report on parliamentary elections and immunities has already been printed and distributed I recall that the Junta of Parliamentary Elections and Immunities has decided by majority to propose to the Assembly to reject the request of the judicial authority regarding the interceptions of 15 May 2018 progressive n. 2521 and progressive n. 2523 for the uncertain and implausible configuration of the requirement of necessity and in relation to the progressive phone calls n. 2618 of 17 May 2018 progressive n. 5760 of 27 July 2018 progressive n. 5997 of 4 August 2018 progressive n. 6043 of 6 August 2018 progressive n. 6044 of 6 August 2018 and progressive n. 6090 of 6 August 2018 to reject the aforementioned request without the requirement of chance and occasionality I would ask the rapporteur Senator Malan if he wishes to speak
Thirty seconds I 'll give it to you MANTOVANI M5S In our country access to culture should always be encouraged and not hindered A group of 20 dance schools met to ask political institutions to take a step back on green pass legislation because the discomfort of young people and girls is increasing and we can not go on like this Even football teams under 17 close A thirty eight year old man set himself on fire in the square in Oderzo because he did not own the green pass and had been fined PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator the 30 seconds you asked for more have passed MANTOVANI M5S I ask the government to step back from this abnormal application of the strengthened green pass because it is clear that it is not a health measure and it goes to compress freedom violently on people not particularly subject to the Covid 19 pathology and risks increasing economic damage and also the psychological retention of children and in the younger sections of the population PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator if you do n't I 'm gonna have to take your word for it MANTOVANI M5S I 'm finishing thank you I have retabled in this House the amendments that have not been taken into account in the Commission which call for a return from the green pass reinforced to the use of the green pass base with the use of the FFP2 mask I think it 's a measure president Thank you Senator Mantovani She is registered to speak Senator Cantù You have the right to do so
The next item is Information from the President of the Council of Ministers on further developments in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine I remember that live television with RAI is in progress I call the President of the Council of Ministers Professor Draghi
Thus by synthesizing Senator Ciriani 's proposal the week following that of 12 June the Commission 's work would take place and the entire programme of which it has read before would be moved to the following week I put to the vote the proposal to amend the timetable for the work of the Assembly put forward by Senator Ciriani It 's not approved
CIRIANI FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen the first thing I would like to say on the premise is that we think as a force of opposition but I believe everyone here in the Senate that at such a serious and difficult time for Italian politics when we do not know if we will have a government this afternoon there is only one place where the President of the Council should stand now and that place is here in the Senate of the Republic because we want to confront the President not the empty benches of a ghost government The second thing I would like to say is that we have read the agencies because we are not in the majority and we know of the attempts made this morning to try to keep the majority together not on trust without voting on trust but by voting on the amendments in such a way that we can continue in government action according to such a Byzantine reasoning that no one has managed to understand it I want to remember that because when some of you some of the newspapers or televisions or some of the intellectuals who are crazy come to tell us that this is the Government of seriousness we will remind him of the scenes from the low empire this morning We are faced with terrible and epochal challenges some of which have already been mentioned by our colleagues in the Group who have spoken I will mention only one fact that has been released with the latest bulletin of the Authority for Energy in the last year the average price of the gas bill for Italian households has risen by 70.7 the electricity bill from now to July 2023 will rise by 91.4 I too am forced to make the geopolitical picture I dare say of the situation in which we are all involved there is war 700 kilometers from the Italian border there is a huge difficulty in guaranteeing the supply of gas there is a huge problem to get the grain out on the Black Sea there is the risk of famine in African countries there is the very real risk that famine generates new migratory waves that add to those already existing there is the problem of inflation never so high since 1986 there is a pandemic that we do not yet know if it is behind us there is a drought crisis that brings agriculture to its knees These are all the emergencies that Italians worry about and that Italians believe should be at the heart of the government 's action However it would take a strong cohesive and serious government instead we for weeks I have lost count of how many we live in a bubble made of blackmail theater ultimatum and penultimateum all of which belong to the worst first Republic We have a former President of the Council Count who still has to work out the double mourning resulting from the division of Di Maio and his eviction from Palazzo Chigi and that one day yes and the other also bombards the Government The President of the Italian Council is on a mission to Kiev in the war zone and while he is in Kiev he does not know if his country has a foreign policy because in the same days in Italy his majority of foreign policies put in place three or even four And then a few days later in Madrid we have a NATO historical meeting to decide the entry of Sweden and Finland but our President of the Council Draghi must return hastily to Italy he is a beautiful figure that our country makes on the international scene You tell us that the Government is the one that guarantees the image of Italy abroad Well Draghi takes the plane returns to Italy because it happens that Conte Grillo and pieces of the 5 Stars blame each other for being totally inadequate And if they say so we of course believe it If that were not enough the Democratic Party planted its ideological flags in the House knowing that it had no chance of having the ius scholae or the law on drug liberalisation passed with the sole and sole purpose of irritating and provoking the allies of the center right Faced with this with what has happened and is happening we have been waiting for weeks President colleagues for someone from the government to stand up and say or shout Look my boys the recreation is over But no one stood up to say that President It seems that the government is a Titanic going towards the rock as the orchestra sounds louder and louder and more and more crowded The so called best government has come to the judgment of public opinion and Parliament saying that it would be the government that would guarantee reforms important things the fight against emergencies stability but the result that you bring here today is exactly the failure on all these fronts You give us today the failed balance sheet of your government action I am asking those who have asked even in these hours whether the Government should continue its action even after would you entrust the government of Italy in the autumn to a majority that falls because it is not able to approve the realization of a thermovaluer in the province of Rome If you are unable to approve this what reforms can you approve in the autumn What kind of emergency war can you make if you can't even do the politics ABC This is because there are no technical governments there are no institutional governments there are only political governments This is a political government with everyone in it But a political government with everyone in it can't help but end up doing it it 's going to crash It 's like driving a car in which there are passengers each of whom wants a different destination The end is this either you stand still or you go against the wall Unfortunately what we are witnessing is exactly the clash of the Government against a wall and in doing so brings with it also the destiny of Italy Mr President I do not know we will now listen to the final explanations of vote what the Members of the Movimento 5 Stars will say I know that in recent weeks they have said that they want to stay in the government but also stay out of it that they vote for trust but they do not vote for it that they are against this Executive but the Ministers are very close within the Commission I would like to say that the situation is serious but it is not serious Even with regard to this we of Brothers of Italy claim goodness rightness courage foresight the seriousness of having remained the only force of opposition and we reiterate once again that we are not and will not be willing to make the stamp of any government because we just want to be part of a government elected by the citizens of center right Mr President ladies and gentlemen I regret that President Draghi is not here because I would like to tell him that we expect him because we believe he is a serious person apart from political differences to be consistent with what he announced only 48 hours ago at a press conference when he said that there is no and there will not be another Dragon Government following this without the current majority I would add that only those who fear or despise democracy are afraid of election day This majority ladies and gentlemen is over and this Government is also over Let 's give the Italians the floor with the vote let 's finally let them decide who they are governed by
CIRIANI FdI Mr President the request just made by Mr Malpezzi is of course shared by us Already at the last Conference of the Leaders we said that the presence of Mr Di Maio could not be sufficient in the light of the seriousness of the situation which unfortunately already yesterday apart from the events of this night was perceived as dramatic Therefore it is absolutely urgent for the President of the Council to report to Parliament on the actions Italy intends to follow up with regard to the dramatic crisis that is taking place As the Brothers of Italy Group we confirm our condemnation of what is an unacceptable military attack on a sovereign state and against international law And we ask you to know from the voice of President Draghi what are the choices reactions and measures Italy intends to take together with European and international partners in the hope that at least this time the European Union and the West will be able to make their voice heard
CIRIANI FdI Mr President President Draghi colleagues finally the Government after weeks of waiting referrals and solicitations also on our part reports to Parliament and the Senate on crucial and vital issues for our country for our economy for our security and also for the international prestige of Italy It should do so by virtue of a strong clear and united mandate but it is clear that it is not and will not be so We have read the resolution of the majority which has arrived precisely in the last few minutes it seems to us the usual mind fragile fragile made to please everyone and not displease anyone I will also give you another impression that I had Mr President in the twenty minutes of your report I felt more concerned not to say than to say to fade to avoid and not to displease anyone I understand that because its majority is really difficult to hold together it is an absolutely chaotic majority The problem however and the question that we ask ourselves on behalf of the Italians is what is the foreign policy of the Italian Government Is there only one party or are there so many parties that support it We have also seen like all Italians the television images of his trip to Kiev and compared to this arise at least two considerations The first is that the journey that you have made with the leaders of France and Germany takes place three months behind the similar one that the conservative leaders of Poland the Czech Republic Slovenia and England have made almost as if they wanted to send a message to Ukraine let 's see what happens and then we put our feet on the land of Ukraine That was n't a good message in our opinion The second question Mr President is that as the images of you and the other European leaders visiting Kiev and the suburbs of the capital the places of horror flowed on televisions in the homes of the Italians your majority continued to fly the rags as it has been for weeks and as it has happened up to a few minutes before you entered this Chamber I have here with me only a small part of the dozens of articles speeches and interviews that pieces of the majority have released against other parts of the majority or that pieces of the majority have released against the Government It really is not a great spectacle in which he distinguished himself alas a former President of the Council on which I do not want to extend myself because I do not have time and because I do not want to inflame for the sake of Fatherland Something else has happened His Minister for Foreign Affairs was put on trial and distrusted by his own party which is the first party in his majority this was because the Minister for Foreign Affairs shared the foreign policy of the President of the Council No one here but above all outside this House and outside the national borders among those who look at us may not consider what happened extremely serious for the reputation of our country I want to say to you President as a convinced opponent of your Government that Italy does not deserve a foreign policy made up of cleverness ambiguity and divisions especially at a time when there is a war 700 kilometers from the border of Trieste It is foreign policy you teach me this Mr President which qualifies and defines a government especially in the eyes of international chancellors However its majority is also arguing about foreign policy Indeed I would like to say that it is mainly arguing about foreign policy You can't you can't listen to people say We are with NATO but we are against arms we are absolutely pro-Atlantic but we are against military spending we are at the side of the Ukrainian people but against sanctions we are at the side of the heroic Ukrainian people but we do not recognize the Ukrainian people 's right to defend themselves their freedom their cities President all people of common sense all people who have a shred of humanity can only hope and work for peace or at least for a ceasefire But you and your colleagues will forgive me because I do n't want to seem pedantic or pompous five hundred years ago in Italy in Florence a gentleman named Niccolò Machiavelli wrote definitive things about how men are doing and how the world is going because then in the end politics moves with realism and pragmatism The first rule is that unarmed solidarity with an assaulted people is only rhetoric that the unarmed diplomacy offered to an attacked people is useless and ruinous and that the search for peace for peace that is the pacifism of which many fill their mouths is only another name that we give to unconditional surrender President and colleagues on 7 April you explained the DEF that the Italians were called to choose between peace and air conditioners Unfortunately we must note that we do not have peace and we have no guarantee of the functioning of the air conditioners either We have proposed a resolution which seemed to us of absolute common sense a maximum price for gas a European solidarity fund for the countries most affected by the crisis an international fund to avoid famine in North Africa You have said no and it is surprising as is the obstinacy President with which its majority continues to reject our amendments which call for the use of Italian gas fields in the Adriatic Sea which are not used or underused while our neighbours naturally do not waste time I must conclude because I only have eight minutes at my disposal we of the Brothers of Italy Group are not and will not be from now on for more reasons the crutch of the Government Once again we are proud of the courage in this House to have been the only force of opposition but we are well aware of the duties and responsibilities that derive from our European and international position Above all our leader Giorgia Meloni who is also the leader of European conservatives knows this This is the strength on which we have built our consent which is so annoying especially to professional haters who stand on the left Mr President we have said this from day one we are the ones who do what they say we are doing it only in the name and in the interest of Italy and we will do it today without asking for anything in return as far as we are concerned that is all that matters
CIRIANI FdI Mr President I am speaking on this article and in general on all the articles that we have voted very hastily because it concerns perhaps the most important part of the draft law namely the reform of the MSC I believe I have heard in this House and outside this House on television over the past few years that someone has called for the long 30 year war between politics and the judiciary hundreds of vibrant complaints from colleagues especially from the centre right on the political use of the judiciary and on the policy that came into the investigation to strike opponents How many times have we complained about this and how many times have we denounced the fact that politics had to regain a role and dignity knowing how to respond and reform justice Well in the end protests about the political use of the judiciary about currentism about career investigations that then result in nothing have produced nothing indignation produces nothing because we are voting for a reform that is little more than hot water The heart of politics in the judiciary stems from the fact that there is politics within the Supreme Council of the judiciary So if we do not eliminate politics within the Supreme Council of the judiciary everything else is completely useless We must be aware of this especially you who have often denounced the attacks of the judiciary on politics since the time when President Berlusconi received a guarantee notice in Naples in 2007 just after taking office as President of the Council I wonder what has been the use of all these years of political battle if then to the test of the facts the reforms that are taking place and voting are little more than hot water The problem is that if you do not introduce the draw all the other formulas you can invent do not serve and avoid the currentism I do not say that as Dr Palamara said at the hearing both in the Justice Commission and in the Anti-Mafia Commission where he stated that only the draw can interrupt block and defeat the cancer of politics within the judiciary in the form of a current This reform that you are voting for does not serve this purpose because the CPMP will continue with the formulas that you have chosen with the instrument of politics to promote careers and to designate appointments and will continue always with the instrument of politics within the judiciary not to hit with disciplinary sanctions those magistrates who do their job not for the sake of truth but for the sake of political faction Therefore I repeat once again our vote is in favour of this amendment but contrary to the articles because unfortunately with great bitterness we find that so many years of battle have not really served anything Once again I repeat that if we do not intervene in politics within the MSC politics will continue to radiate from the Supreme Council of the judiciary in all prosecutors because they will be convinced that they have once again won the battle against politics and can once again unpunishedly play their role not as magistrates but as political agents and partisans with the certainty that they are safe and that no one will ever be able to strike them This is the battle we have waged for so many years and we cannot escape now that there is finally a chance to give a signal
Mr President President Draghi Members of the Senate Members of the Government what has happened in these hours and is still taking place in Ukraine for the direct and precise responsibility of Putin 's Russia is undoubtedly very serious Suddenly we feel like we 're living a nightmare We are facing a dramatic crossroads of history with scenes that we thought delivered forever to our past History places us in front of a crossroads and a brutal acceleration really dramatic because it sweeps away in a single moment the illusions of those who after the logic of the blockades after the cold war after the fall of the Berlin Wall had imagined that history would have a linear path the triumphal march of democracies freedom and rights It was n't like that and it 's not like that Democracy is falling behind and it is our duty to defend it in every corner of the world This crossroads however Mr President ladies and gentlemen also sweeps away the theories of those who in recent years thought that the world the planet and the great geopolitical issues could only be regulated by business the market or by good feelings turning their eyes to another side so as not to see reality as it is or the theories of those who explained that there could be free unarmed states while once again history teaches that States are based on numbers strength and even armies without which the innocent are the first to succumb President Draghi today here in the Senate also for the Brothers of Italy Group for our President Giorgia Meloni is first of all the day of sorrow for the civilian victims for the military victims and for the suffering inflicted on the population And it is also the day for us especially for us if you will allow us of the tribute to the Ukrainian patriots who are fighting alone a desperate war They 're fighting alone a desperate war Politically however for us this day in the Senate as well as in the House is the day of responsibility decisions and unity of the unity of our country of the unity of the European Union I would like to say of the unity of the whole free world These are duties which we as a group certainly do not want to escape We have however Mr President the need to say not today because this day is dedicated to something else that the time will soon come to deal with our mistakes and our faults Mistakes and faults in fact there have been and it is useless to deny it as it is useless to hide the dust under the carpet I want to refer to the failure of our national and international diplomatic action to Biden 's failure in American foreign policy to the hasty and shameful withdrawal six months ago from Afghanistan with NATO allies alerted a few days or a few hours earlier to the role NATO wants or can play at this moment which we have not yet understood and finally I want to refer to the fact that there is no European Union that carries out an understandable and perceptible military activity The European Union militarily does not exist simply I want to make a single reference instead to our domestic policy to the issues that concern our country and I have to do so right now because you did too President Draghi Italy 's energy policy in recent years has simply been reckless We have assigned and entrusted the energy supplies of a G7 country the second European manufacture to politically dangerous countries and at the best of politically unstable cases We have given up a national energy security plan to pursue political correctness to pursue ideological environmentalism In other words we have entrusted the security of our country and our businesses to those who live politics as if they were Alice in Wonderland But today I repeat once again is not the day for these discussions which we will soon have to do Today it is a day for us for our Group for our political strength to reaffirm so that it is clear and there are no shadows that those who unilaterally decide to attack with arms in hand a neighbouring country immediately and automatically put themselves on the side of the wrong and that there are no reasons of political character geopolitical character historical character pseudo historical character recent reasons or past to justify a war of aggression President and colleagues the Brothers of Italy Group represents the only opposition in this House but we have always defined our national patriotic and absolutely responsible opposition We will be as a force of opposition at the side of the Italian European and international government institutions at this epochal moment for the simple reason that it would be impossible as well as wrong to choose not to take sides I happened to read yesterday a speech by Angela Merkel spoken I believe to the European Parliament two years ago during a serious crisis like this perhaps more serious I do not know we will see it that is the pandemic crisis These are words that can be perfectly adapted to today 's crisis The Chancellor said on that occasion that Europe is not such if we do not support each other when an emergency of which no one is guilty strikes us Referring to that crisis he added that we also have the task of showing who we want to be like Europe I want to remind you that there can be no children and stepchildren even in the management and consequences of this crisis and because I have also found it out of place on the part of Senator Renzi the continuous polemical postponement at these moments to the positions taken by courageous states such as the Polish one which have tried on their skin the wounds of communism and which still host hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine Mr President in Office of the Council precisely because of what you have said the risks we face and the challenges we face we ask you to represent first of all to the European allies the interests of our country the hopes the demands of our citizens and also the legitimate concerns of our companies and our entrepreneurs who risk paying a high price perhaps the most expensive of all in view of the inevitable retaliation of an economic nature We ask you as a force responsible for opposition to act according to the political realism that pushes us to far sighted solutions but also to remember that politics is made of ideals that push us to courageous choices to defend the innate idea that we have of freedom which must be defended every day in Rome as in Kiev
CIRIANI FdI Mr President I would simply like to remind my fellow Senator Romeo that our amendments have all been submitted to the Commission on a timely basis
"CIRIANI FdI Mr President we will abstain on Amendment 3,300 first signed by Senator Angrisani We have presented similar ones to the Commission precisely to exclude certain types of activity from the rigors of the law that the Government and the majority will approve shortly However it is worth remembering that our amendments to this article and also to the previous ones have all been punctually deposited in the Commission and all of them have been promptly rejected by those who may now have some crisis of conscience and want to blame us for mistakes that do not belong to us We have a clear and correct position Amendments from a regulatory point of view have been foreclosed which is why they are not filed"
CIRIANI FdI The truth hurts Finally I remember the truth hurts that the easiest way to repeal an article is to vote against it It is the simplest thing in the world No amendments are needed Everything else is part of the problems of the parties the positioning the difficulties within the majority You have chosen your path we respect it but do not come and blame us for the responsibilities that are yours and not ours I repeat that the easiest way to say no to the solution proposed by the majority is to vote against the article Everything else does n't need to be done
CIRIANI FdI Mr President I rise because the Brothers of Italy Group did not vote in favour of the proposal for the timetable that you have just presented to the House and I want to explain why to the Members of this House The proposal in fact provides for a reduction in the time in our opinion incomprehensible and intolerable of the debate on two crucial aspects of political life and of the most recent political debate The first is the reform of the CSM 's judicial system The majority proposal is that given the fact that Minister Cartabia is unable to attend on other days if not Thursday morning Parliament adapts itself to the needs of the Minister rather than the Minister to the needs of Parliament Therefore such an important debate such as the reform of the MSC which has engaged for months in the general debate the parliamentary debate in the Commission is compressed in the Commission and reduced with the presence of the Minister only on Thursday morning On Wednesday afternoon there will be a general discussion in which the Minister will not participate because on other matters involved This is yet another episode that testifies to the importance that the Government attaches to the activity of Parliament Where there are no decrees in question there is this general contempt for the activity of the majority and the opposition I of course speak in the interests of the opposition Mr Balboni and I have tabled dozens of amendments to the Justice Commission not of a destructive and obstructive nature but simply in order to be able to debate them We have already understood that this cannot be done either in the Commission or in this House That 's the first reason The second reason is linked to the other decree monsters a decree that naturally presents the requirements of necessity and urgency There is nothing but a soup decree in which there is anything in it 50 articles with brief hints about the universe because we talk about everything In addition I would remind my colleagues that today there has been a school strike linked precisely to the prediction that the Government makes to include the negotiation and recruitment of school staff by decree- law avoiding the debate with the social partners We were hoping that at least this could be discussed in the Commission in a timely manner adapted to the complexity and scope of the arguments We realized that 's not possible Our proposal Mr Calderoli is to dedicate next week to the work of the committees on the MSM on the reform of the judiciary on Decree Law No 36 which contains various points on the universe and on the whole world also called PNRR and to hold Wednesday and Thursday next the vote in this House having devoted sufficient time to the examination at least in the Commission That is our proposal and we are asking for it to be put to the vote
CIRIANI FdI Mr President at the end of the debate on this Conference on the future of Europe we can say that at least one positive fact has led to it it has confirmed to us that the most important European institutions the Commission Parliament and the Council feel that they do not adequately represent the wishes of the citizens There is some difficulty in feeling truly representative of the peoples and citizens who elected them otherwise they would not explain this will and this project to build such a long and complicated session of listening to citizens and peoples In fact national parliaments and the European Parliament already exist to listen to and represent the wishes of the citizens Obviously in all this something does not work if you have set up this complicated phase Moreover this long Conference on the future of Europe which as Mrs Rauti has also explained has had a very long complicated and very troubled gestation in fact in its construction and also in its final outcome responds to the same defects and limitations as the institutions that wanted it that is the terrible bureaucratic slowness the distance from the expectations and sensitivities of the citizens the craftiness and inevitably the great desire for it The problem however remains what I mentioned earlier namely what a conference on the future of Europe needs which should express the will of the citizens when the elected parliaments are already there to do this It seems to me a little bit to feel in these arguments what we felt until a few years ago when a political force represented today in Parliament in fact the most important political force represented in Parliament said that it was necessary to bypass Parliament that one is worth one that it would be the Internet and social media that would determine the policy of the future We know the damage this vocation has caused yes genuinely populist and demagogic of politics the deletion of the idea of delegation for which Parliament is bypassed and people are directly listened to But who are these citizens and who has given them the task and the burden of fully representing the will and ideas of their fellow citizens This nobody has explained so much so that both today and in the European Parliament we have declared that the selection path of this audience and this panel of European citizens remains very mysterious very opaque and not transparent On the other hand it is a very small representation of the European population chosen with criteria that still remain very untransparent for us Another point that must inevitably be stressed unfortunately and without particular satisfaction is that this Conference on the future of Europe has hardly ever been heard of neither in the media nor in the newspapers nor in the news I have not seen a single person I have met in recent years and I have met so many in my political activity who has asked me what was going on at the Conference on the future of Europe This is because in fact almost no one except the specialists knew of its existence In the first formulation of the motion tabled by colleagues from the Democratic Party and the 5 Star Movement there was a hypothesis that we clearly rejected that is the idea of automatically promoting the proposals made in that forum and of transferring them to the will of the parliaments and then of the Government It was an unacceptable proposal because Parliament is not the passcard of the Conference on the future of Europe and because those proposals were the most varied the most heterogeneous and even the most contradictory We are here to do our duty which is also to discern the proposals on which we have a positive opinion from those we are naturally opposed to So the risk would be to create terrible confusion and to promote contradictory measures However since we were talking about major issues and even about the revision of the Treaties that are at the heart of the European Union we have allowed ourselves to fly just as high and we have said that if we have to talk about this then we have to talk about the whole of the European framework also in the light of the historical events that are taking place at the borders of the European Union I am referring clearly to Ukraine We believe that this is the time to reiterate that the European Union as it has been structured over the decades is not what we have imagined Ours is a different model confederal in which States largely maintain their sovereignty but they give up that slice which is useful to create a political European Union on the major issues that we have blanked out in our motion security defence foreign policy and geopolitics trade policy migration and demographic policy and the major health issues related to natural disasters This is what Europe should strive for and converge on This is certainly not the Europe we have known which has been marked by pervasive legislation I would say all pervasive growing and meticulous Europe deals with thousands of issues that are not important often bothering citizens and businesses but it does not deal with and does not care about major issues so it remains an economic giant and a political dwarf It is clear that if Europe wants to be different and to become a political protagonist it must have a common foreign policy and to do this it also needs a common army and a common military policy all things that are not there and that when they appear they immediately find the resistance of the same parties and movements that call for the European Union 's protagonism against China against the United States etc Our motion is a way of reaffirming the diversity of our approach to these great issues which does not mean being anti-European but rather perfectly pro-European in a different Europe stronger and even more supportive on the big issues and not on the small ones in search of a single standard that can enter into the detail of the activities and life of all citizens from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Finally Mr President with reference to the historical and cultural roots of the European Union which with an absurd choice have been removed from the foundations of the Statute of the European Union itself I am referring to the classical Jewish Christian cultural roots of Roman law Greek philosophy etc I do this because in just a few minutes we will discuss in this same Chamber the figure of St. Francis of Assisi Then I wonder could the Europe we know be the same without the medieval roots built by St. Francis and the culture of monks Benedictine abbeys and monasticism That culture is not Catholic or Christian but it has saved classical culture and delivered it to posterity We would not be what we are if we did not have this behind us even the figure of St. Francis with all that he represented for the history of Italy and Europe So ladies and gentlemen we will abstain on the agenda that the majority has proposed because we recognise this it is a step backwards from the first motion which was unacceptable but there remain great differences from the strategic vision that you have set out which seems to us very weak compared to what we imagine which I repeat is the dream of a different Europe If Europe does not wake up now with what is happening in Ukraine I think it will never wake up
CIRIANI FdI Mr President in the light of the statements made by Mr Amendola I would like to make the request for a separate vote on the motion for a resolution by the majority and if necessary on my first signature of the motion for a resolution by the Brothers of Italy Group President Draghi members of the Government ladies and gentlemen tomorrow 's European Council is the first after the word war with its terrible meaning has entered into the vocabulary and political agenda of all European Chancellors indeed of the world We are clearly faced with a leap in quality and a change of paradigm in politics after many years have explained to us that globalisation would bring peace to the world and remove borders states and differences between political systems It has not been so it is not so and more importantly it will not be so and we will all have to realize it in a very serious way not to be as someone has said with very effective expression in these weeks mere tourists of history observing the history that passes by us without not realizing it Tomorrow 's European Council many of my colleagues have already said so and President Draghi mentioned this in his reply is crucial to understanding where our continent is going and for example if Europe wants to be a political entity with its own foreign and military policy However it must be clear that this can only happen if we radically change the approach that Europe has taken so far To date Europe has dealt with a thousand unimportant things often breaking the boxes of citizens and businesses and never a few really important things including at the top of the list foreign and military policy This also means rethinking our role within NATO not Italy 's membership of NATO but I repeat the role we want to play as a country and as a European community In fact we have to confess that we have given NATO a blank delegation on our defence because we were pleased to be unaccountable and to entrust the American giant with the resolution of international conflicts since they are merely compressive Finally having a foreign and military policy means perhaps more important and difficult increasing military spending because there is no other way Mrs Rauti mentioned the projects that started they are little but they are a sign in the direction that we all wanted and that Brothers of Italy promoted by formal acts amendments declarations and resolutions often unfortunately rejected in the past years This is unless President Draghi in its majority as I think we are snooping one does not think that this we are living is just a parenthesis of history After the night everything goes back to the way it was before and we go back to not seeing the problems hoping that if there are problems someone will solve them for us So we will be in fact the tourists of history As I said this attitude of the many is perceived also within the majority As it happens those who say that military spending is not important and priority let alone They 're the same people who 've been saying no to everything all these years They said no to gas oil regasifiers and nuclear renewable sources said yes but please not in their constituency but in the next one We are dealing with a majority that I do not know if it has fully understood the gravity of the moment we are living We have voted on sanctions against Russia with a sense of responsibility and we will vote on them again even tomorrow However we must say one thing about this which was a fundamental act to demonstrate the unity of the Western world with Russia These sanctions do not all strike in the same way it is honest to say that Italy pays a higher price than the United States or other European countries pay for example I say this in order to reiterate that solidarity is necessary within Europe and also with the overseas partner on this game otherwise there is the risk that someone thinks that there are A series partners and other B series partners people who pay a high price and someone else who does not pay any I say this also with reference to the decree law on energy which the Government issued a few days ago and which we declared not only late but also very disappointing There are whole sectors and whole chains of the Italian economy that are likely to fail President Draghi We need a new recovery plan dedicated this time to the energy problem of Italy because unfortunately Italian companies are the most exposed to economic retaliation They are the most exposed because of us but I would like to say because of you that you have ruled this country for ten years without having guaranteed economic independence However this is also due to the fact that our economy is based on export On the subject of expensive bills I must remember that authoritative representatives of this Government have shouted at speculation in place but they have forgotten to say who the speculators are and what the Government intends to do to punish them A similar speech applies to the PNRR I am not one of those who entrust to the PNRR who knows what salvific capacities of the economy I recognize it as very important but perhaps there have been too many expectations around it It must be said however that that plan was written in another historical epoch not in this one The invasion of Ukraine has created a very strong discrimination and we must renegotiate it and review it together with the local authorities the Governors the companies that are likely to fail The risk in fact is that the next bans should be deserted that that money will not serve or be insufficient and this would be a failure that the country cannot afford Finally I would like to make a few remarks of a deliberately political or perhaps even controversial nature Mr President in Office of the Council I am speaking on behalf of the Brothers of Italy Group which has been told painted and described by certain lazy intellectual press but I would like to say more simply in bad faith as a sovereignist Group where for certain press for certain mental intelligence or in bad faith this term indicates a kind of concentration of all the negative qualities that a political formation can have I would like to ask my colleagues from the Left the press and intellectuals who teach us what the whole world is discussing these days if not national sovereignty the freedom of countries What do political sovereignty and freedom consist of other than autonomy i.e. military energy and even food sovereignty In the matter of sovereignism a term that we could also replace with others that maybe like them better I would like it to be clear that there was someone who had seen us long As I come to the conclusion I note that yesterday President Zelensky spoke to the House President Draghi said that Italy is in favour of Ukraine joining the European community It is a wish that we make our own It 's a long path and it's the beginning of a positive path Mr Zelensky addressed a European Parliament as a leader Before the institutions the one that unites the Italian people with the Ukrainian people is the common belonging to European culture and civilization That is why we are at the side of the Italian Government and at the side of the Ukrainian people in a battle of freedom which they also fight in our name
CIRIANI FdI Mr President it would be enough for the Italians to be able to see the debate that has not been held at the Conference of the Leaders and what is taking place now so that they can realize the state of this majority and if it is possible that a reduced majority in these conditions can govern a country struggling with an economic crisis that risks being disastrous and with war at the gates and borders of Europe The theme of these last days was the letter that President Draghi sent to you and through you to the group leaders whom we call diplomatically irritating while others used other adjectives Many of the Members of all the groups have been a little upset because the President of the Council seemed to give homework to Parliament establishing what it should do in what times and in what ways I too am a little concerned and I recognise Mr President that I have always tried to defend the prerogatives of the Senate However after listening to the debate at the Conference of the Leaders and that in this House I am concerned about the emptying of the role of Parliament by not so much the Government but the Parliament itself or better the parliamentary majority that decides to give up discussing the most important issues affecting our national and international communities I would like to give a few examples which we have already heard at the Conference of Leaders We asked for for example one simple thing Thursday was the question time and the presence of Minister Patuanelli Since there is an emergency of swine fever and there is an alarm in Italy about the consequences of its spread which naturally alerts people after two years of pandemics we have proposed to allow the question time so that the Minister can respond not to our concerns but to those of the people who are at home It can not be done the majority has decided this issue which everyone is talking about the Senate must not be concerned The most serious thing is that we are witnessing this theater of hypocrisy staged by the colleagues of the Movimento 5 Stars not alone but certainly first so they say one day yes and the other that it is essential that Prime Minister Draghi report to the Chambers I have here with me a copious press review which concerns only the last two weeks with very heavy quote statements from the major representatives of the Movimento 5 Stars and not only but also from other parties of the left and the majority I quote a few The Premier comes to the Chamber and speaks to the Country or Conte the Chambers must vote on arms When will we vote What are you going to do in addition to this false protest that you have just staged so that the Chambers can vote It is not enough to vote against the timetable to wash one 's conscience What are you going to do to restore the centrality of Parliament so that we can discuss what President Draghi is going to discuss discuss and discuss in Brussels on 30 and 31 May Colleagues do not tell me that this is an informal meeting because informal meetings on such important issues simply do not exist There are no informal meetings when I read from the official website of the European Commission the Heads of State and Government are called to discuss four topics the first is Ukraine the second is energy the third is defence and the fourth is food security Well the Senate of the Republic has decided that all these issues which the whole world is talking about are not affected We are calm because the Minister for relations with Parliament and the Government have reassured us saying that we will talk about this in a month 's time We 'll talk about it in a month Meanwhile nobody knows what will happen in Italy Europe and the world from here to 21 June The urgent need to report to Parliament which is on the news and on the web but here it leaves no trace because you think you deceive us and the Italians simply by voting against the calendar Take on the consequences of what you say and really put the government in crisis on these issues Have the courage to show your muscles Instead you are content with a few words which leave the time they find Here not only is there a legal obligation for the President of the Council to report to the Chambers a legal obligation but there is a huge question of political opportunity On the other hand Parliament has decided to sink itself That is why Mr President I repeat that what I am most concerned about is not the interference of the executive power in the legislative process which is a long standing issue and which perhaps we will not be able to resolve What worries me is the surrender of Parliament and the majority of the government 's will to decide for everyone Even the haste with which President Draghi sent that letter is intended to say to Parliament we urgently need the Senate and the House of Deputies to give us the delegation to decide That draft competition law is in fact essentially in its most important parts a delegation to the Government This is what happens the government tells Parliament that it is urgent to legislate in its place and Parliament decides that it has no interest in discussing the most important issues which concern Italians European citizens and citizens all over the world
CIRIANI FdI Mr President President Draghi colleagues in the Senate these days but also in the last few hours we have heard dozens perhaps hundreds of times of the call for seriousness and responsibility But I ask myself and ask you what is less serious and less responsible for saying one thing and then making another to invoke consistency and then do exactly the opposite to make consistency in fact rag paper What is less serious and responsible for announcing that only a majority of a certain type will be made and then working to do anything else What is less serious than the spectacle of a majority who has been slapped throughout the general debate and a Senate paralyzed by the fear of the vote and the return to the judgment of the Italians What 's less serious than the show we offered on live television than a Senate divided between ambiguity tricks half votes vote yes vote no suspend make a resolution withdraw etc I really think you 've crossed the line That 's it Let 's pull a line and move on President Draghi we anticipated what happened months ago at the time of the election of the new President of the Republic And we had said and reiterated dozens of times that this majority could not work because it is too contradictory within itself it had explosive contradictions that could not be hidden I want to read President and colleagues of the Senate some of the adjectives with which you have qualified in the last five days and they are adjectives that we have taken from the agencies from the press articles and from the interviews of all the majority groups with all the other majority groups Then you have defined yourselves as irresponsible untrustworthy wretched natural incompatible insane indecent provocative dishonest hypocritical calamities I 'm staying here because I only have ten minutes and I can't use all the time to list all the compliments you 've made But then all of a sudden you came here to the Senate to explain to us that the irresponsible and unreliable together with the wretched and incompatible together with the insane and dishonest provocateurs would all of a sudden work together for the good of Italy What happened Mr President was inevitable but I want to remind you of some very strange and very serious things in my opinion that have happened Among the many ministers who do not vote for the trust of the Government of which they belong Ministers who remain within the Executive despite their party do not vote for the Government of which they belong demonstrations organized by the PD and other left wing parties to claim not the right to vote but the non -right to vote We have seen people who have come to the streets to claim the right not to vote I do n't think it 's ever happened in any country in the free world an almost Orwellian scene if I 'm allowed I would also like to say that I am politically ashamed of what remains of a movement that was to make the revolution and had to break down the caste and become a super caste of powers and privileges I am ashamed of this ship of desperate people who wander from one part of Parliament to another in search of someone who extends their experience in the Senate or in the House for a few months who is willing to vote for anything to keep their place President Draghi this morning we of Brothers of Italy listened to you with the attention of always because we have the respect of the institutions But it was immediately very obvious and it does n't need to be a political commentator that his whole speech was built to please the Democratic Party and the Left not a word in favour of the centre right its concerns and its demands Do you know what hit me the most Its umpteenth because it has already said so before promise to reform the income of citizenship President Draghi among other extravagant things of your majority there is another one that you certainly know there is a party not the largest but one of the noisiest which deposited in the cassation the request for a referendum to repeal the income of citizenship that is a measure that voted one two three four times when it was worth 9 billion 10 billion 11 billion Citizenship income we repeat this concept is discrimination those who believe in citizenship income cannot believe in cutting the tax wedge those who believe in the model of citizenship income cannot believe in the model that we invoke that of responsibility health enterprise commitment sacrifice They 're two worlds that can't be together and you want to keep them together just for power Once again no more lectures We do not put Italy at risk We Italy have it in our heart it is written in our manifestos and in the reason for being Brothers of Italy What is at risk is not Italy but a system of power that the Democratic Party has built since November 2011 when they kicked Berlusconi out of this Parliament Since then this system of power has been stronger and more and more ramified and puts in place all the instruments that it has no one excluded to preserve itself It pains me to see that even in the centre right in Parliament and in the regions there is someone who does not understand the game if you are functional to this system of power you suddenly become intelligent kind sympathetic if instead you fight to assert a different principle an alternative you immediately become stupid and dangerous And that 's enough of the barbarian fake news on the doorstep We have started with responsible people we govern municipalities and regions also very complex and also very advanced We have demonstrated our seriousness in foreign policy as Mr La Russa also said in his speech when we sided with Italy the European Union NATO and Ukraine It could have cost us so much in terms of election but we did it spontaneously because that 's exactly what we think it 's right to do Finally President Draghi I want to tell you something else I do n't know if you 're interested but I really do n't believe in the sincerity of your friends and allies Those who applauded her this morning applauded her only out of fear they were the same ones who boycotted her the day she went up to the Quirinale They are people who praise you in public and betray you in private We do exactly the opposite we are people who say publicly what they think even privately If she succeeds in putting together the pieces of what remains of her majority she does not deceive herself they will come back to fight to make the traps to put her in trouble until the next ambush because they love to play on the skin of Italy Mr President Brothers of Italy certainly as he did not vote for the first trust in the yellow green government failure trust in the second government the yellow red government failed and we had foreseen it confidence in the third rainbow government failed also this will not give you confidence even today And we will do it without tactics with an open face with the clarity and consistency of all time We want to stay away from his false friends from his false allies from the false love of Homeland from the false sense of responsibility from a Parliament dominated by the fear of the vote that thinks only to survive We work for a new government serious strong and also responsible yes responsible because we are serious people and I want to reiterate that But this government is not what the thousand mayors of the Democratic Party decide but it is what millions of Italians decide on election day
Mr President I do not know if I will use all the time available tomorrow our colleague Isabella Rauti will speak on the explanation of vote on the occasion of trust and there we will also go into detail of the many reasons that push us to this step that we could have avoided but to which you pushed us with your irresponsible conduct I would simply like to remind the House and the few Members that what has happened these days has remained I have read and heard surreal reconstructions of what we have all lived together in the Joint Committees on Foreign Affairs and Defence Unbelievable things have happened but it does not mean that they are positive indeed they are certainly very negative especially for the country that has the misfortune to be administered and governed by a majority that has lost control of itself at such a serious moment in international political life I said that incredible things happen it happens for example that Brothers of Italy present an agenda in the Commission to make a very trivial request The agenda simply repeats things that have already happened repeats quote statements of the President of the Council Draghi on some international commitments that Italy has signed several times in recent years repeats what already contained in a similar agenda approved by a very large majority in the House and simply asks that those commitments that were worth to the House a week before may also apply to the Senate the following week Instead in the turn of the incredible things it happens that the Movimento 5 Stars probably wanted to use our agenda for its political purposes to boycott the majority of which is part The government in fact in the face of such a linear and transparent agenda does the only thing it could do it welcomes it The Government in fact cannot fail to accept an agenda that reflects the historic position of Brothers of Italy which existed before the birth of this Executive and this legislature because it was part of our electoral programme already many years before The Government therefore does one simple trivial thing it accepts the agenda that makes statements on which the Government had already expressed itself positively the week before in the House Of course this is not enough It happens that a former President of the Council of this country in office for three years goes to the current President of the Council whom he at least formally supports and tells him that he does not agree It happens that the President of the Council even addresses the President of the Republic to confirm the line of the country in line with the international commitments entered into The next day however another film is staged that is this childish and ridiculous attempt I repeat childish and ridiculous of the Movimento 5 Stars which convinces the majority which is now in disarray to stage the following brilliant stunt The agenda was accepted by the Government This is history and you can't go back from history However we are clever so we commit ourselves not to go to the House with the rapporteur we ensure that the Commission does not finish its work so think it found it ingenious that it arrives in the Chamber with the old text so that the agenda accepted by the Government no longer exists Magically it does n't exist anymore it never existed it never happened that the government accepted that order a day We therefore have the waltz of hypocrisy the 5 Stars pretend not to know that the rest of the majority is against its positions while the rest of the majority pretends not to know that the relative majority parliamentary force namely the 5 Stars is against what the rest of the majority supports This is the political framework in which we are about to vote for a government that does not have a majority in the matter of foreign policy at the most serious moment in republican history of the last forty years That 's what we 're talking about The tricks the hypocrisies the regulatory games in which you are very good are not enough to hide this simple truth To my five remaining colleagues in this House I would like to say that if they have the courage of their opinions true courage not fake courage they must take paper and pen and write an agenda in which they say we do not recognize ourselves in the statements of President Draghi we do not recognize ourselves in the foreign policy of this Government we do not recognize ourselves as said by the President of the Council in the Chamber They had to say this or they could do something even simpler that is to call their Minister for Foreign Affairs because they express the Minister for Foreign Affairs and say to him dear Minister which side are you on Are you with Dragons or are you with us If as I imagine the Minister for Foreign Affairs is loyally and faithfully consistent with your positions why has he not spoken Why did n't you say what you think How long do we have to wait to know what the Minister of Foreign Affairs thinks about the position of the Movimento 5 Star Group to which he belongs In this context can we as an opposition even remotely imagine voting in favour of a measure which we share on the substance knowing that that vote would give strength to a majority and a government that is irresponsible at a time of utmost seriousness The world observes us looks at us and wonders how it is possible that a country which is in a difficult situation like the rest of the world is governed by a majority that does not have a military policy and a shared foreign policy that betrays the international commitments entered into by the same Government by previous governments and by the same majority Majority in which a gentleman who was the President of the Council sits and now says things opposite to what he said only a year or six months ago This is the majority This is the majority of a government that is called the best but that makes us disfigure internationally That is why we maintain our clarity of positions we maintain our coherence we maintain our willingness to always vote in favour of Italian interests especially when our credibility at international level is at stake but we cannot vote for trust in a government that has behaved in this way
Mr President I would like to take advantage of the presence of Mr Patuanelli to explain Amendment 1.10 which basically calls for the price of agricultural gas oil and for fisheries to be reduced Because very often in this House so many colleagues especially the members of the Agriculture Commission have denounced the sudden increase in fuel costs due to the Ukrainian crisis which we all know and as this violently and dangerously impacts on our production chains today with this amendment we have an opportunity I therefore ask the Government to evaluate the amendment proposal at the first signature of Senator Ciriani with whom as I said it is basically asked to reduce the prices of agricultural gas oil for fisheries and for the agri-food chain and to eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies SAD in order to further reduce the charges on fuels used by the supply chains I would ask the Minister who is here to give a favourable opinion because apart from his intentions and good intentions I believe that it is also appropriate and fundamental to give concrete signals and this amendment goes in this direction Thank you for your attention Minister
CIRIANI FdI Mr President I am speaking on Amendment No 1.12 because for many weeks now Parliament and the Government have been engaged in the debate on tax delegation We have read dozens of very demanding and very hard statements from representatives of the majority parties who said that the house is not touched because it is the fruit of the sacrifice and savings of the Italians It has been clearly stated that any hypothesis even theoretical of increasing cadastral values is not acceptable and not even conceivable It has been said and pointed out on our part Mr President that the increase in cadastral values and the reform of the land register do not only affect the value of housing but are likely to exclude hundreds of thousands of families from the social benefits linked to the values of the ISEE Clearly in fact if a person or a family has the misfortune because this is the case of having a house owned the result of many sacrifices the cadastral revaluation also produces an increase for the purposes of ISEE in addition to the damage the mockery In the end however the moment of truth always comes in life and also in politics Mr President ladies and gentlemen this is exactly the moment of truth We have the opportunity not to announce to the newspapers but to vote pragmatically now at this time in this House a commitment to the government to cancel that reform from the political programme we also have the possibility to say that that reform is a scam that we cannot say that we are doing the reform but we will not apply it because not even a child believes it So now we of Brothers of Italy have made a commitment to call to accountability and transparent decisions all parties There is no possibility of escape either we vote in favour or we vote against Everyone will then assume their responsibilities
TOSATO L SP PSd Az Mr President Government ladies and gentlemen it is clear to everyone that this vote of confidence is not like everyone else but it can lead to the fall of this Government and the resignation of President Draghi and who knows perhaps even at the end of this parliamentary term We will vote for confidence we will vote for it mainly because the measures contained in this decree law are useful I would say more they are necessary to the country in this dramatic situation Removing trust in a government is a legitimate choice doing so on this measure is irresponsible Not trusting the Government today means saying no to energy measures to protect households and businesses it means no to zeroing the electricity sector 's system charges for the third quarter of 2022 it means no to reducing VAT to general charges in the gas sector it means no to tax credit for businesses road hauliers the fishing sector and the purchase of energy gas and fuels It would mean colleagues saying no to new rules to facilitate and accelerate the production of gas in our country and energy from renewable sources Not voting for this confidence also means saying no to measures to support companies liquidity which we know is necessary It means saying no to measures in the field of social policies measures in favour of territorial authorities regions provinces and municipalities and to all the amendments that parliamentarians approved in the House with the consent of the Government improving this decree law It means ignoring the work done by Parliament more than 20 billion Then it means questioning the next decree- law the one at the end of July announced by the Government and in which we put a lot of trust additional resources to face the most dramatic situation that our country has lived since the post war period Is it easy to be part of this government and support it Certainly not Certainly it is not for us for the League a political force that has nothing to do with the policies of the Democratic Party the 5 Star Movement and LEU However it was a choice dictated by necessity there was no clear majority in this legislature it was necessary for each of us to assume responsibility on the basis of our own possibilities and the situation we were experiencing We are experiencing a dramatic situation not only because of the pandemic but above all because of the consequences of the war in Ukraine Unimaginable scenarios have developed in this legislature and others we hoped would be handed over to history New commercial economic and political walls have been erected with dramatic consequences for families and our economic system The dear energy of light gas and fuels is such a serious phenomenon that every attempt to contain it is still insufficient and inadequate at present despite the tens of billions allocated by the Government to contain its effects there is still no favourable solution to protect families and businesses Who would politically want to be dealing with this situation today Who would want to be responsible for dealing with these emergencies It is clear that it is difficult for everyone it is difficult for the League but it has chosen to give its support to the Government Dragons and has always done so with the utmost commitment of its Ministers and its parliamentary groups to the House and the Senate We did not escape this responsibility because the time was and is exceptional It was certainly easier to stay on the sidelines to the opposition to criticize what the government does or does not do it would have been a certainly more profitable choice at the electoral level a choice of convenience but useless to try to resolve the dramatic situations that our country is experiencing We prefer to put ourselves to the test every day in the Commissions and in the House in order to improve the measures of this Government It is certainly easier to abandon the game now escape and escape from their responsibilities at a time when a very difficult and very heavy autumn is announced for those who will have to take political decisions I do not want to judge the behaviour of a Movement that has decided to take away the trust of the Government but a request I feel to do it do it responsibly do not put at risk the approval of this and the next decree law and the allocation of tens of billions necessary and useful to families and businesses I shall end this speech President with a few requests from the Government if there is one more Much has been done over 33 billion to try to curb the increase in gas and fuel bills much but not enough beyond the good will and commitment of Parliament and the Government What 's missing First of all for us we need the tax peace and the dismantling of the debitory records We cannot think that in the face of this crisis and all the increases many Italians who have always fulfilled their duty who are not tax evaders and who have endured the most severe economic crises are also facing the arrival of tens of thousands of tax collectors We need common sense we need responsibility And then we also ask for the solution for those who have invested in the 110 building bonus it takes balance This measure comes from an earlier government He probably made mistakes but expectations have been created Investments are being made by companies and households which cannot be abandoned halfway We must accompany them with the necessary investments and find a solution We are asking for a correction of citizenship income Colleagues it is creating major problems instead of creating employment it is driving people away from the world of work who could find employment in the tourism and agriculture sectors there is a shortage of staff yet expenditure on citizenship income increases There 's a short circuit that needs to be corrected There is the very serious theme of the purchasing power of Italian families The increase in energy costs has shown how much purchasing power is absolutely inadequate there is real inflation that we consider more than 10 and we need to intervene to protect the purchasing power of Italian workers and pensioners The Government has started this debate the League will be present and participate with concrete proposals to restore dignity to the purchasing power of families As for the subject of energy self sufficiency we believe in investments we are not the party of the no to everything the thermo- valuers regasifiers and instruments that give energy self sufficiency to our country We also call on the Government to seek with greater conviction at European and international level the way to find the end of this war which has led to energy increases that we are unable to withstand The war is hurting everyone and our country perhaps more than others President the League has been and is loyal has accomplished and will carry out until the end of this parliamentary term its duty to protect families jobs and businesses If however the conditions are no longer met take note of them and vote on them The dramatic situation in the country cannot wait for the slow and cumbersome responses of politics rapid and concrete answers are needed
TOSATO L SP PSd Az Mr President on behalf of the League Group I too would like to join in the speeches of my fellow Members in thanking the quaestors for the work they have done over the past five years We have entrusted this task surely to attentive caring and conscientious people in managing the Senate budget so we thank Senators De Poli Bottici and Arrigoni for the work they have done on behalf of the whole House I would also like to thank the entire administration of the Senate starting with the Secretary General the Deputy Secretaries the directors the officials and all the staff that has accompanied us over the past five years with great professionalism with great competence with great willingness to face every situation even emerging that has occurred in the eighteenth legislature Surely there was no manual to manage what has happened to us so starting from the quaestors senators and from the whole structure there was a demonstration of efficiency in adapting to the needs that the country was experiencing and that consequently also lived the Senate guaranteeing the safety of the health of all those who work in this great structure but at the same time without that the works had a bending in the times and the quality of the service that we must guarantee regarding the legislative activity I believe that we have dealt with this emergency in the best possible way and we must thank those who have put this task on their shoulders As regards the 2021 and 2022 internal financial statements the Group will vote in favour We appreciate the fact that despite the difficulties there has been a surplus over the previous year of 3.5 million and we hope that the next budgets will still be in the virtuous line that this College of Quaestors has drawn The challenge of the next parliamentary term will be to demonstrate that in view of Parliament 's decision to reduce the number of Members the effectiveness of legislative activity in the Commissions and in this House will not be diminished it will be necessary to ensure that this virtuous process can continue thanks to the choice of Parliament and the electoral body which in a referendum has confirmed the reduction in the number of Members thereby achieving further savings It is obvious that the reduction of parliamentarians may lead to potential difficulties in the management of the work and in the representativeness of the territory We hope however that it will have the virtuous aspect of reducing the costs of public and political machinery as requested by the community I would like to thank President Casellati and Vice Presidents including Senator Calderoli who is chairing the Assembly today and I would like to thank the whole structure of the Senate once again
Mr President Minister ladies and gentlemen the trade union act concerns the business crisis of ACC Compressors former Zanussi Elettromeccanica a historic company located in the Belluno area founded in 1960 and leader in the production of compressors for domestic use I am speaking on behalf of the Parliamentary Group of the League in particular of my Venetian colleagues Romeo Candura Fregolent Ostellari Pizzol Vallardi Zuliani and ideally allow me also on behalf of my late colleague Paolo Saviane who came from that territory and who has always represented him with a great spirit of service and passion In 2003 ACC Compressors was sold by Electrolux to a private equity fund and entered financial crisis in 2009 In 2013 it was admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure and in 2014 the Ministry of Economic Development awarded the procedure of disposal of the company complex in favor of the Chinese group Wanbao giving life to the company Wanbao ACC The industrial plan of the new company provided for the re-launch of the plant in the area of Belluno However strong competitive pressures and limited investment in R &amp D have had a significant impact on prices so that a positive contribution margin cannot be obtained The shareholders initially complied with the commitments made at the Ministry of Economic Development covering the operating losses until 2019 However in March 2020 the company requested a declaration of insolvency and following the adoption of the appeal in March 2020 the company was admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure in May 2020 In May 2021 a competitive procedure had been initiated for the sale of the business branch which had raised the interest of the main global operators in the sector but no offers were received on the expiry date of 6 October of the same year On 19 October 2021 the Ministry of Economic Development authorised the reopening of the competitive procedure and as we have been told three official expressions of interest were received from the Ministry In the final analysis he asked what initiatives the Minister had to take in order to quickly identify the most suitable path to guarantee employment prospects and a productive revival of the ACC plant in Belluno in an area characterized by other crisis situations PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Economic Development Mr Giorgetti has the floor to answer the question which has just been put for three minutes
Mr President I would like to thank the Minister for his reply The interrogators and the League Group are pleased with the Government 's response Thank you and unlike those who preceded me I did not catch propaganda in his words but concrete answers useful for the common good The manufacturing and industrial sector is fundamental for the growth and well being of a country as you said in a previous intervention Companies located in mountain and foothill territories must be defended representing a fundamental outlet for the employment of young people in those territories The alternative is the abandonment of one 's own land in search of fortune elsewhere starting from big cities or abroad for those who have the opportunity The effects of the pandemic the dear energy and the lack of raw materials are seriously jeopardising the maintenance of Italy 's production system already in crisis in many sectors for reasons of competitiveness The Government and Parliament have a duty to deal with this difficult situation with great commitment and unity of intent We are pleased that in the case of the historic company in Belluno the Minister is succeeding in achieving the comforting results because the salvation of every single job means saving a family from deep economic social and personal crises The task assigned to you is burdensome but we are sure that the Ministry of Economic Development is in very good hands The League Group will always be at your side and that of the Government in the front line to defend companies and jobs We still believe that Italy belongs to the culture of work we are convinced that Italy cannot abandon its vocation as an industrialised country Each of us must play our part in this direction At this difficult stage we could not stand on the sidelines and watch and criticize what others did or did not do it would only be a convenient position Others have made this choice we have chosen a more difficult path for us but more useful to the country We thank you Minister and we are pleased that the families of ACC Compressor workers can look to the future with greater hope
TOSATO L SP PSd Az Mr President the measure under consideration by the Government that it calls for confidence certainly contains measures that are acceptable and therefore it will have the vote of confidence of the League The work in the Commission to improve the measure certainly took place with the commitment of all all the political forces and the Government Everyone basically did their part Overall the judgment can only be positive Are the measurements right That is the question we have to ask ourselves when we vote on a measure The answer is that yes they are useful because they support many groups affected by the pandemic and the economic crisis However there is another question that we have to ask ourselves and that we have a duty to ask ourselves are these measures sufficient Unfortunately the answer is that they are not The next decree law supports will also contribute but the moment we are living requires more effective responses from the Government The energy and fuel increases the difficulty of finding raw materials for industry to which we are adding or could add difficulties in supplying cereals feed and fertilizers require extraordinary action The government 's response seems slow In the Budget Committee we have all felt a strange feeling that we are examining a fair useful measure but absolutely out of the reality that the country is living today We are deeply concerned because steel mills paper mills and other production activities of the big industry are suspending production it has never happened in the history of our country It is a very serious damage to the entire manufacturing chain The costs in agriculture are now out of control I think for example to agricultural gas oil in the road haulage for the increase of fuels one risks the blockade of the country The supply of industry and large scale distribution is at risk of being put at risk by a blockade which must be avoided We all know that inflation is increasing considerably and the purchasing power of households is in danger of being irreparablely compromised These are the damages and these are the risks The government must therefore act now immediately more quickly every day of waiting is a lost day and must do so with important and decisive measures The next decree energy law what we expect to be launched this weekend cannot be expected timid or partial it must be courageous and decisive On the increase of fuels the League was the first political force to call for action on excise duties VAT and extra-trajectives but we want an effective measure a reduction of 15 cents is not an adequate response Interventions must be effective Citizens those who work and create jobs are no longer content with symbolic interventions are no longer content with our good will nor are they satisfied with our greatest commitment They want they want concrete results The crisis in industry the economic sectors and the agricultural sector is following and will unfortunately follow the social crisis of families and not only of the groups closest to the poverty line but also of the middle class Who today can afford to live dignifiedly with increases in gas electricity and fuel which sections of the population Perhaps for the first time only medium high incomes a minority of our population can do so The installment of bills and taxes is not enough it is not necessary it postpones the problems and does not solve them it makes the ascent to get out even more impervious We demand more from this government be it clear We 're in a dramatic emerging phase As the President in Office of the Council Draghi said we are moving from a market economy to a war economy so all the old rules budget balance constraints restrictions limitations are no longer current The government with President Draghi must obtain significant derogations at European level and far more important than what we are proposing to the country The League wants to help avoid a scenario that really risks being dramatic He wants to do so by supporting this Government and will certainly do so by voting on the measure under consideration Look however that the abyss is near it is near it is imminent This can be a decisive week We have high expectations from the energy decree but we also have high expectations from the decree that will change the rules regarding the containment of the pandemic and the rules that we have set to limit the severity of the situation We say and ask for enough of the rules that have led to the green pass the super green pass and the impossibility for workers over 50 to go to their jobs This is also an answer the country expects We have taken action in emergency situations The emergency today is less we must take note of it and give new freedom to the country and to the citizens who claim these results We will support the government but ultimately we ask for more speed more awareness more courage and more determination
Mr President the document on economics and finance is certainly an important step towards the end of year budgetary law It is an important step because it analyzes the health situation of the public accounts analyses macroeconomic data and basically sets out the path of our country to arrive to define a fiscal law that is useful to the growth of our economy in a period of great concern of great stagnation and of great difficulty I believe that it is difficult to define a DEF this year as a reliable forecast because there are many elements of uncertainty that obviously affect these forecasts All of us have spoken in this debate and we are repeating the same concerns well or badly we are talking about energy costs the cost of raw materials and also the difficulty of finding raw materials to feed our production system we are talking about the cost of fuels and also about the crisis in finding food resources which is not yet so obvious but which could be real in the coming months Then there is the trend of war which is absolutely unpredictable and the consequences it will have on the economy of Italy Europe and the whole world It must also be considered the most worrying figure of this beginning of the year which is inflation an inflation out of control never so high that does not even appear so credible in the estimates of ISTAT which seem optimistic compared to the reality lived by our families by our country system We therefore believe that the DEF in question inevitably makes not necessarily reliable forecasts and in our view also quite optimistic We understand that the government should not give rise to concern in public opinion in families with respect to the productive system that must have confidence to continue producing working investing and spending This is right but we hope that the Government will have the perception of the gravity of the situation because this debate does not seem to be related to the reality that our country is experiencing There 's a bigger economic emergency than the one caused by Covid Europe has reacted quickly and effectively in the management of that emergency today it seems slower more uncertain again divided for example in establishing a roof at the price of gas Let us return to the interests of the individual nations that make up the European Union Even on the use of the measure of budgetary deviation it is obvious that if Italy used it autonomously the spread would grow and there would be a negative impact on the credibility of the Italian public accounts with serious consequences We need joint action from Europe but it is not yet coming The government is asking for great sacrifices in these months to the Italian people in order to face the emergency that we are experiencing but it must face this crisis with the same courage and determination It seems to us that our government is not quick and quick in decisions There is not enough money for a few billion to slow down the increase in energy and fuel costs They are palliative they seem to be good intentions but they do not face the gravity of the moment in a structural way It is clear that the economic situation is dramatic that the costs are unsustainable for families and for productive activities despite the almost 20 billion allocated by the Government These are important and enormous appropriations and we appreciate the effort made by the Commission and the majority united in supporting these measures That 's a lot a lot of 20 billion but alas it 's absolutely not enough There are very worrying signs When there are steel mills paper mills and strategic sectors of our industrial system that suspend production it is not just a wake up call it is a situation that risks degenerating because the entire production chain suffers from these industrial production suspensions Unfortunately the Government has been able to and has been able to give only partial answers with substantial appropriations in the amount but absolutely insufficient and inadequate to be effective We therefore ask the Government not to lower its guard and to intervene more decisively The budgetary deviation today is not an option but a necessity and of course this decision must be taken at European level it cannot be Italy alone that takes on this responsibility We therefore ask the Government to succeed in obtaining a chance in this direction before the system jumps because the time factor is also crucial if we wait too long companies and activities will close one after the other without the possibility of reopening once the crisis ceases Today we need a similar reaction to what Europe was able to put on the ground when the Covid emergency occurred with important appropriations The danger of a social crisis as many colleagues have said is at the door There is a fire under the ashes there is a situation of apparent calm in the country but the suffering of many and too many Italian families who are unable to pay and honor their debts is at the limit People and families who have always been good taxpayers today are no longer able to do so because the energy gas and fuel costs as we have said are so high that even medium sized salaries are absolutely inadequate to withstand this collapse So let 's be careful because if the fire hatches under the ashes the fire could flare up at any moment the social rebellion could rise at any moment This debate risks being surreal too far from the very serious reality that our country is experiencing The effects of the war were devastating highlighting first of all the wrong choices made by Italy in the past Energy dependence and strategic sectors have made us weak and fragile Maybe we all thought that the opposition and the cold war were behind us and in this we were probably wrong just as we were wrong in thinking that there was a global market for which the surplus of production of certain goods in some areas of the planet could feed our industry and our needs With regard to war which is a very delicate subject on which many reflections can be made the faults are clear and evident those of Putin who wanted to open this conflict However we must ask ourselves whether this conflict could be avoided what role has the European Community played and what role Italy has played especially what role it wants to play today We are convinced that it is wrong to throw gasoline on the fire It is wrong for world leaders to feed this conflict with their own words It is necessary to seek a way of peace because only at the end of this war can we return to normal The return to the Cold War is certainly not good for Europe and it is not good for Italy We must be protagonists at European level in the healing of ongoing conflicts and in returning to a normal situation involving the removal of those walls and barriers A normality that has allowed us to have greater peace on our planet and also the possibility of positive trade for all world economies This must be our objective beyond all other considerations Therefore we hope that the Government will be clear about the seriousness of the situation and that it will allocate the resources necessary to avoid an economic collapse which risks being devastating and cannot be overcome by our economy and Italian families
Mr Malan FdI Mr President first of all I would like to thank the College of Quaestors in the people of Senators Laura Bottici Antonio De Poli and Paolo Arrigoni who presented us with this budget and went through a particularly difficult period like all the staff in the Senate I would like to highlight some aspects of what senior commissioner Antonio De Poli has said about reducing Senate spending over the past few years I will just quote two figures which I want to highlight Over the past ten years Senate spending has increased from 475 million to 445 million euros despite an inflation of 13 During the same period government spending rose from € 794 million to €985 million It is clear that the needs are different and the State has different starting points than the Senate However it is certain that if the State had by far the most unlikely hypothesis observed the same trend we would now have problems placing the primary and secondary surplus of the state budget rather than trying to reduce and buffer the increase in public debt The reduction has been particularly marked in the area of the economic treatment of senators as well as of course in all other sectors I remember that a few years ago we wanted to make people believe and it was also written in the newspapers that the Italian Parliament was the most expensive in the world Here too I quote only one figure among the many namely that the United States Senate which also consists of only 100 senators spends 150 million a year on the direct collaborators of senators and that same item on this budget is less than 16 million When it is said that the Italian Parliament is the most expensive in the world then it is obviously not the truth but I do not insist on the point The reduction in the number of parliamentarians will involve a reorganization starting from the next legislature which must go in the direction that has been tried to pursue in recent years and which has been achieved namely to fully maintain the first function of the Senate which is not to reduce expenditure even if it has been carried out with great consistency in recent years by the quaestors senators but to have an effective legislative activity to be able to listen to the needs of the citizens and to be able to exercise its functions of inspection union or control over the activity of the Government This is the challenge that awaits us every year but in particular with the passage that is about to take place I would like to take the opportunity to join in the thanks but I would like to do anyway despite having already been mentioned to the College of Quaestors to President Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati to Vice President Roberto Calderoli who is a certainty of this Assembly and with him to the whole Council of Presidents to the structure of the Senate starting with Secretary General Elisabetta Serafin to the Vice Secretarys Alfonso Sandomenico and Federico Toniato and to all the staff of the Senate who has always performed his work with great professionalism and punctuality but in recent years because of the pandemic he has had particular difficulties contrary to what has been proposed in some way the Senate has never closed and has continued its activity always without limitations except those dictated by prudence and measures for the containment of the pandemic In this work the Quaestors were particularly active but I would like to mention in particular Dr. Federico Marini the elderly doctor head of the medical structure of the Senate who had great attention and great effectiveness The measures that were implemented here in the Senate before many other structures proved to be very effective as well as the assistance that was given during the stay in this institution to all those who gravitate around the Senate from staff to senators I would also like to give a word to the employees of the Groups to the collaborators of the Groups and to the collaborators of the senators who are people of high professionalism and constant precariousness because at the end of each legislature their working relationships are interrupted sometimes even when there are conditions such as pregnancy and anything else and every time there is a new restart which does not always concern everyone We must pay attention to these figures which are indispensable for the proper functioning of the Senate I therefore conclude my speech by announcing the positive vote of the Brothers of Italy Group on the Report and the Senate 's draft internal budget
"Mr Malan FdI Mr President the Brothers of Italy Group joins the commemoration of Enrico Berlinguer in the hundred years since his birth Enrico Berlinguer in the twelve years in which he was political secretary of the Italian Communist Party undoubtedly led his party which was for the first forty years of the Republic the second party in Italy from a position that was closely linked to Moscow even in the first years of his secretariat to an increasingly autonomous position to affirming that Italy needed the umbrella of NATO an extraordinary evolution in this relatively short period of time Enrico Berlinguer has gone beyond the usual patterns of his party and its part not only in this extremely important evolution of the international position of the Communist Party but also in other respects As well as in truth his predecessors he fully accepted the rules of democracy even at a time when the bond with the Soviet Union which was certainly not democratic was very strong It was as has been said a man of dialogue so much to meet and this was particularly difficult at the time Giorgio Almirante who was the leader of the Right a courageous act that was followed by the presence of Almirante himself at the funeral of Enrico Berlinguer We commemorate this man who has certainly been among the most important political figures of the post war period knowing well that on many issues we have been and are very far from him but the approach that we believe is correct in relation to the characters and historical events is precisely the opposite of cancel culture that is to pretend that events of decades ago conform to the current standards and to judge with an extremely biased spirit Clearly his is a figure who is very far from us from the political point of view but it is due to respect for a political leader who guided with great dignity an extremely important political force in our nation and who collected millions of votes during the elections as has been recalled in 1976 he exceeded even 12 million votes but remained the second party Just six days after his sudden disappearance which took place on 11 June 1984 the Communist Party became the first party in Italy in the European elections overcoming for the first time the Christian Democracy even if by a little more than 100,000 votes Well in front of those who represented so many Italian citizens respect is due so we join his memory in this commemoration"
Mr Malan FdI Mr President the Brothers of Italy Group is close to the people of the Marche region affected by this serious event We express gratitude to all those who have activated themselves volunteers Forces of order the Regional Council President Aquaroli who has always been in the operating room to give his contribution in this difficult and unpredictable moment in its specificity certainly We offer our condolences to the families of those who have died and we propose to be actively and effectively alongside all the people areas and municipalities that have been damaged A policy on hydrogeological failure must be created a policy on the management of water resources and all watercourses Of course such a concentrated precipitation in such a short time is in any case extremely difficult to manage all that can be done to mitigate the effects of these events must be done and I believe that this is a commitment that we take on and we are sure to see that it is common on this front in any case and from every position of government at national and local level On this as always we will be determined and consistent
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I rise to announce the request for a secret vote on Amendments 1.30 and 1.32 which concern the Parliamentary Assembly for Elections and Immunities
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I rise to vote in favour of Amendment 1.30 Coming into the substance of the proposal today the Junta for elections and parliamentary immunity has a peculiarity compared to the other Juntas having a very particular task that is to decide on the election of one senator instead of another in the case of disputed elections or when there are appeals It is a matter of deciding on arrest authorisation to use telephone interceptions and other extremely sensitive issues The Rules of Procedure currently in force today very wisely provide that the Assembly for elections and parliamentary immunity unlike the others cannot be a place where senators enter and leave and where a senator can be removed from the position of rapporteur on one of these important measures this in order to prevent the Junta which has very delicate functions someone says courts someone says parajurisditional where in any case it is not decided in the last instance because ultimately it decides the Assembly but we work on issues such as arrests and legitimacy of election become a political instrument in the hands of the Leaders group who have well understood all our esteem starting with our own whereas today it should be an instrument that is based on the law rules and defence of the prerogatives of the Senate rather than of the individual senator While it has its justification to conform to the rules of the standing committees for example the junta for the Rules of Procedure ensuring that if there are passages from one group to another the representation always respects the current conformation of the parliamentary groups in this case the principle of faithfully representing the parliamentary group as it is in the Senate assembly as a whole should fall because there is a much stronger principle that is that it must be decided on the basis of law Imagine what would happen if a rapporteur who had to intervene in the matter of arrest did not comply with his group 's expectations he could easily be expelled from his group and perhaps then re-entered after a week so that the Group would not lose this senator either in order to assign the position of rapporteur to another senator who is faithful to the Group 's indications Since these are such sensitive issues choices must be made according to science and conscience and not by group discipline which is very useful in general parliamentary discipline I therefore reiterate my request for a secret vote recalling yet another detail the rapporteurs for the election and confirmation of the senators of the various regions are chosen by a random mechanism established by the Rules of Procedure In this way we overcome this randomness that is extremely opportune because obviously a senator member of the Junta can be of one party or another and in the Regions unpredictable problems emerge and it is better to unpredict otherwise we risk having also in this case a pilotage of the rapporteurs of the individual Regions and this would really go against the principles of thirdness of fidelity to the law and to the science and to the consciousness that should be the fundamental principle of the work of the Junta for the elections and the immunity
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I welcome the call for the withdrawal of amendment 5.4 and announce the request for a secret vote on amendment 5.0.200
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I would like to refer to what the signatory of the amendment Senator Maiorino who mentioned distinguished philosophers scholars and literary scholars both ancient and recent rightly saying that language expresses a culture and a feeling That is why language should not be subject to rigid regulations on one aspect rather than another All those scholars from Aristotle to the most recent ones wrote in a language that they did not decide what rules he had but they did make up for what the language had produced The language is changing sometimes it evolves into another and is extremely democratic Suffice it to say that the language of the learned the Latin in our nation was surpassed by what was called vulgar the language of the people because the people won against the learned The learned continued to write their scientific philosophical and literal essays in Latin but then won the people between the Petrarch of the Canzoniere and the Petrarch who wrote in Latin he won the Petrarch who wrote in vulgar language So we are in use which must be understood Today we speak differently than seventy years ago when the Constitution was written but it must be a process that happens spontaneously out of respect for certain categories and sensibilities the rule cannot be laid down otherwise we should also regulate a whole series of other situations other categories other expressive forms that have changed since the adoption of the Constitution to the present We are abstaining on this amendment because we would like to prevent it from starting to regulate from one step to the next The language is free it is an expression of the people and culture as Mrs Maiorino said This is why we refer to what the language expresses knowing that it is changing so today we use a language of a certain type but a rule that perhaps in twenty years needs to be changed again
Mr President ladies and gentlemen let us remember that this reform of the Senate 's Rules of Procedure is not the first of recent times At the end of the last parliamentary term a very important one was adopted which introduced some rules to speed up the work and which if adopted by the other branch of Parliament would make it easier for certain aspects of the process of passing the laws This reform is mainly due to the reduction in the number of parliamentarians approved with an amendment to the Constitution which required at least to adapt certain numbers such as the minimum number of senators to form a parliamentary group or to request votes of a certain type These numbers obviously had to be adapted to the new reality On this we all agreed as well as on some speeches not necessarily related to the issue of the number of senators but to common sense I am thinking of the rule set out by President Pesco of which I have shared many of the arguments and which he has presented The Budget Committee is always overworked It is for the work it does generally for the truth but when the Government does not cooperate as has happened lately and does not provide technical relations the work stops completely The proposal which has been unanimously adopted and which is now of course submitted to the House 's decision is that the budget Commission should not give its opinion on all the amendments but only on those adopted This of course greatly reduces work and makes it possible for this to be done even more precisely and precisely We as the Brothers of Italy Group and specifically Senator Zaffini and I who have followed the work of the Committee for the Rules of Procedure have not shared some points of this reform outside the issue of numbers which I summarize here One aspect relates to senators who do not subscribe to any group Until now those who left one Group and did not enter another either by their own will or because no one accepted it joined the Mixed Group which has a particular situation With the text that arrives in this House which can always be modified by the amendments it is expected that senators who leave their group and do not pass on to another will become non-attached to any group It is a curious thing because already today there is the institute of senators not enrolled in any group but it is a privilege of senators for life I call this privilege without any negative connotations The senators for life have a particular profile they are former Presidents of the Republic and people appointed for very high merits as the Constitution provides so it is also normal that they may not join any Group The current Regulation provides for this as a possibility not as an obligation That is why it is clearly a privilege Now providing any senator with the opportunity to enjoy this privilege we do not believe to be acceptable The intention is to discourage the transitions from one group to another but let us not forget that we are at a time when the parties have been belittled subjected for decades to accusations of all kinds Let 's be clear the parties have made many serious mistakes but this is in the dynamics of things if they were all perfect a perfect party would suffice but thanks to heaven there is no one and therefore there is pluralism However the fact of getting rid of any party label and even the label of the Mixed Group is frankly a privilege that can be good for the senators for life on whose discipline we would have liked to intervene more widely because we do not think it positive to have as has happened in the past government majorities that stand on the senators for life appointed in an indispensable way by the President of the Republic However since there are we do not find it positive to equate to them senators who either by their own will or because no Group receives them remain without Group the only disadvantage they have is that of not being able to take advantage of the support of the Groups However especially in a Senate with reduced numbers where every senator is worth 0.5 per cent of the Assembly there are not only the structures that the Senate can offer there are immense interests outside the Chambers that have no problem financing all the needs of a senator provided that he puts himself at the service of those interests I believe that we must guarantee each senator the same support since with or without a group his vote is as valid as that of those who were from the first to the last day in the same Group at least to prevent someone from helping enormously higher interests as an entity and often also as a power even political Just think about when Klaus Schwab a private citizen makes invitations to the World Economic Forum and leaders from all over the world run by a private person who evidently has unlimited economic possibilities through him and his friends I say this to give an example but this afternoon during immediate questions we will talk about a single official of the Government who with a small signature guarantees a billion as a gift for Covid refreshments to the poor Benetton and the subsequent managers of the highways This is the real money not the small funds that the Groups have or can support a Member With regard to questions there is not only the question raised by an interesting amendment that Senator Pesco mentioned earlier about the possibility which certainly needs to be studied of being able to question the members of the Authorities in some way There is in fact a problem in this particular case mentioned by my colleague At present the Independent Authority regulating gas prices is making sure that there is a crest on the price of gas which has already tremendously increased Based only on spot prices and not on long term contracts which make up the bulk of gas supply a real crest is created for gas distributors and sellers This is an example it is good that these Authorities are independent but they cannot be totally indisputable and above any possibility of information investigation inspection activity which does not mean going to the place but asking questions and having answers In this regard I move on to another important aspect which is not the subject of the reform and there is no need for it to be I am referring to questions there are not only questions to those to whom they cannot be addressed today but the Government under the Rules of Procedure should reply to all questions within twenty days the answer to a question has however become a part of the lot i.e. it can also happen to receive an answer as in the case where going to play three numbers these are extracted and a certain sum is won Instead this would be a duty of the government It is particularly serious that no answers are received on issues where the government then takes decisions In fact as long as they are answers to issues outside the government 's action at that time in the new measures they are fine But when we have a topic that is being carried out by the government and it does not respond to what it does it is really very serious and breaks the balance that should be there In fact as we are a parliamentary republic there should be Parliament above the government Sometimes we 're really underneath I would add another aspect that is parliamentary practice which is certainly not found in the regulations that say nothing about it Not many years ago in most cases when the rapporteurs gave their opinions they also explained why they were in favour or opposed to a certain amendment In most cases when there were thousands explanations were given to groups Well lately we see the rapporteur turning too often perhaps almost always into the reader of the opinions that are given to him by the Government as the rapporteur himself sometimes says This is not written in the Rules of Procedure which does not prohibit it and does not impose it but I believe that the Senate has a duty to regain its dignity As has been said the reduction in the number of senators does not mean less work and should not mean less role but more role However this also depends on the political will of individual groups and senators who must not be mortified
"Mr President in order to meet the Italian companies that have been very much in serious difficulty for the Covid emergency for the highly restrictive measures sometimes of total closure established by the Government the government the latter and Parliament have approved several measures called refreshments Synthetically the conditions for having refreshments were a decrease in turnover of at least 33 percent otherwise there was nothing a maximum refreshment limit of 10 percent of the turnover to be refreshed if the company had more than 4 million turnover below this threshold you could reach up to 20 percent but in any case the amount could not exceed 150,000 euros Well these measures have proved to be largely insufficient tens of thousands of companies have failed or closed down because when you lose 100 of the receipts and many expenses remain and the state only refreshes 10 it is clear that you are forced to close and sometimes you do not close after the bankruptcy just to avoid troubleing creditors and employees and at least not to affect your personal assets Many companies on the other hand have completely failed At the same time an official of the Ministry of Transport on his own initiative but I hope the Minister is aware of things that concern billions of euros writes to the motorway dealers that they were not directly affected although certainly indirectly so because there were fewer people circulating on the streets but the highways were not closed The monopoly regime continued and while restaurants and bars had to close down the so called grills continued to operate and for the highways it was agreed with the dealers a refreshment of 100 percent even without reaching 33 percent reduction in turnover and without maximum limits That is absolutely unacceptable This money is paid with the umpteenth increase in motorway tolls that will also have to pay the companies that still in a thousand difficulties manage to get ahead including the owners of the companies that have had to close It is a clear injustice an unjustifiable thing that is added to another element only at Autostrade for Italy will be recognized a billion of compensation 452 million are already established in a document that I monster Minister because I see that shakes the head and at the same time these same benefits will affect all the motorway dealers who also have always cashed everything even when they cashed as in all previous years much more than the economic and financial plan approved also by the Government previewed"
Minister I have seen everything over the years to defend the interests of motorway dealers at the expense of citizens and not just those who travel on motorways because we all pay the costs of motorway tolls In fact anyone who buys something knows that those goods will almost always be passed through a highway Well I have seen everything so far but the turns you have expressed in this House really go beyond any limit You mentioned Annex E but look at me as well in it it is written 542 million at the Aspi Motorways for Italy for the only months from March to June 2020 and you said that the refund is only partial He said a very partial truth in the sense that in fact his goodness the Ministry decided that if they cashed 100 less but they also spent 10 less the refund will not be 100 but will be 90 In this sense reimbursement is only partial But then I ask you Minister what is the point of the ristori decree which you also voted for because you are also in the Council of Ministers and not just in meetings with motorway dealers what is the point of setting limits for others and then exceeding these limits for those who are in huge advantage having profits that only in the traffic of cocaine are achieved and are in monopoly situations This is indeed a very serious injustice Thousands of companies have failed and the profits of international investors are being financed because Aspi now has a foreign majority and the Deposit and Loan Fund is in the minority This is absolutely unjustified and shameful I will give all the acts to the Court of Auditors and ask that the executive who has been there for twenty five years against the anti-corruption law be dismissed because it clearly acts not according to the dictates of the defence of public interests but to defend other interests
Mr President I would like to briefly supplement the written report With regard to the details which are certainly of interest in the examination of this document I briefly summarize the issue This is the request for the use of conversation intercepts in which one of the parties is Senator Siri The court 's order requires the use of all of them but has not requested the authorization as it is clearly not usable of the interceptions that occurred after the registration of Senator Siri 's suspects in the register The Junta considered by majority to consider clearly not random the phone calls after the first two which took place on the same day because from the latter it was clear that there was a frequency in the conversations between the lawyer Arata the one whose telephone equipment was intercepted and Senator Siri It was therefore clear that continuing to intercept Arata 's phone Senator Siri 's conversations would also be intercepted Therefore the Junta considered them not random and consequently classified these conversations as an indirect interception but in the knowledge that it was a matter of intercepting a senator 's phone calls which obviously is contrary to Article 68 of the Constitution As for the interceptions of the first two phone calls which it must be said in passing intervened when the Senator was not yet Undersecretary office that will assume about a month later and on the same day in May 2018 the Junta has found that in addition to the requirement of the randomness of the capture itself must exist also that of the necessity The judgment n. 188 of 2010 of the Constitutional Court specifies that establishing the necessity of the use of interceptions for the purposes of the continuation of investigations is the responsibility of the judicial authority but it has the duty to represent this necessity to the Chamber of belonging of the parliamentarians that is intercepted emphasizing that the latter in this case the Senate must be able to ascertain from the examination of the request that the requirement of the absence of persecutory intent and that of the necessity of the act motivated in terms of non implausibility It has to be said that in the same document of the court of Trapani it is stated that it has transmitted all the findings emerged in the context of the procedure in relation to the case relating to the amendment promoted by Paolo Arata and supported by Senator Siri in his capacity then that of Undersecretary of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport Therefore there is even a contradiction in the document itself which says that even without these new interceptions the court was already in possession of everything that was necessary while in another verse it does not give sufficient motivation going beyond what the same document states in its need Therefore the proposal approved by the Assembly of Parliamentary Elections and Immunities is to reject the request for the use of all conversations with two different reasons for the first two the lack of necessity and as regards subsequent ones non-occasion
"Mr Malan FdI Mr President I would like to thank my colleagues who with their applause encourage me to do what we should do here namely explain the reasons for our votes whether they are for or against In fact those who vote against should explain them in particular Let me turn to the content of my speech These days there is a departure from the reality of what is happening here first in the Commission on evening and then in the House this morning and this evening We learn the news that is given for the first time with the right emphasis I must say a little from all the media which tells us that in other countries restrictions obligations and all the various measures of contrast to the pandemic are suspended reduced if not cancelled in some countries they have never even had them Last summer Italy said it was like France But Italy has immediately done much worse than France by imposing much heavier restrictions those of France are lower than those of Italy and are withdrawing them it seems that they will be completely revoked at the end of next month The United Kingdom already had very limited restrictions and they are all being abolished including even quarantine for positives Denmark has abolished them although it has a higher number of infections than in Italy Sweden has never had any restrictions In the United States even the strictest states such as New York are abolishing almost all restrictions many other states have never introduced them Texas has abolished everything since March last year North Dakota and Florida have never had any restrictions Then we come here to the unreal world of Parliament and the Italian Government which introduces new more stringent more irrational more ineffective ones As Senator Zaffini recalled this morning in his speech in general discussion Italy is one of the countries with the highest mortality although it is the country that has the most serious restrictions some questions should be asked It would be enough to compare with other countries that have restrictions completely different from those of Italy such as Sweden if you go to see the curve with the various waves of contagions and deaths naturally compared to the population the trend is parallel sometimes the curve of Sweden rises before that of Italy sometimes after but the trend is the same The same thing is observed by comparing US states with opposing policies such as California and Florida such as North and South Dakota which have opposing policies among themselves but have the same pattern In the face of these measures there is a real question as to what the point is We have asked for a series of interventions from the beginning to the Government The Government has been very generous in limiting the possibility of all Italians to carry out a series of activities then there are the non-vacciners who are subjected to a series of additional restrictions frankly unjustified to a large extent But all Italians are forced even those who have the infamous green pass to spend the day taking out the certificate and being checked to carry out the activities of everyday life entering shops entering Parliament getting on trains and means of transport This is not a privilege but it is also a damage to them let 's think about how many hundreds of thousands of people do this all day that is control others This applies to companies and public institutions with a waste of money and time also for those who have all the certifications of this world What 's the reason Are the measures taken effective No Are they rational No Are they justified by a scientific foundation No Already the technical scientific committee has made them of all colors it has not right a forecast it has said everything and the opposite of everything And we learned a few nights ago that on several decisions it was kept completely in the dark But then the government comes to tell us that it has followed the indications of the technical scientific committee it is not true We are getting used to a government that is systematically lying to Parliament This was done by Minister Hope saying that he did not work with the World Health Organization to hide the scandalous absence of the pandemic plan in Italy he told us that he had not intervened and then it turned out that he had intervened This is repeated in the press conference they were shown by the numbers and a few hours away the number of non-vacciners increased by two and a half million The most incredible things happen Then we asked the Government not to exercise itself in limiting the freedom of Italian citizens as much as possible causing serious damage to the Italian economy particularly in the field of tourism the exhibition sector and everything that is the organization of events because thousands of companies close Well the state does n't do what it should We have been asking for almost two years to work for ventilation in schools and finally in this measure also thanks to our amendment we are talking about it We have called for the strengthening of the means of transport but it has not been done We have asked for serious interventions on timely therapies for all other diseases because it is always said that it is better to prevent than to cure but it is also said that action must be taken promptly Compared to Covid who he does not fail to remember has killed 150,000 people instead it can be expected So if Italy has a higher mortality rate than other countries something has obviously been wrong The watchful expectation which in many cases was unanticipated cost death just as it cost the dead to have prevented as Minister Hope did even if not formally forbidding them but putting many obstacles from doing autopsies at the beginning of the pandemic Evidently for a long time therapies have not been able to take into account a foundation of medical science for centuries autopsies to understand what had happened in the bodies of those who had died It was n't done We have constantly inconsistent measures with contrasts and contradictions We have tabled an amendment in the Commission it was rejected having voted in favour only of the Brothers of Italy which called for a very Europeanist thing namely that the Italians had the same rights as the citizens of other European countries but even outside Europe It should be remembered that those who have done the two doses for more than six months if they are Italian have lost their green pass so they can no longer do anything they cannot work for many categories of people they cannot go to shops trains and so on if they are foreign they can do so for another three months Does that make sense Where 's the rationality Where 's the international profile There are other incredible contradictions non-vaccined blood donors are even urged as are all and of course also vaccinated to donate blood So what 's the point that there 's no problem if they inject into my veins the blood of an unvaccined person but that same person can't get on my own train because who knows what he 's up to after doing the swab and therefore proving that he 's not contagious Well in the face of this we are voting against this measure and we are asking that the green pass be abolished and that what is needed by Italians is done the therapies the aeration of schools a work of information and not propaganda because propaganda it is not information has led skepticism in many Italians obtaining the opposite result the Italians are not being taken for fools and we are on their side"
Mr Malan FdI Madam President representative of the Government fellow senators one thing can be said with certainty about this decree law it has been carried out unseriously and the lack of seriousness on institutional issues is indeed serious Let 's begin with its drafting this decree law is of May 4 and intervenes on the very delicate electoral matter This is not the first time that electoral decrees are written but I remember that in the past when there were no governments that called themselves the best with a prestigious President of the Council that the world envies us not to mention the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Health that the world is very happy that we have and that it does not go elsewhere the electoral decrees were agreed with everyone including the opposition Today the opposition is very narrow it is a small part of the Senate a small part of Parliament but from the statements we heard during the campaign both for the local elections and for the referendum we have to conclude that there was no agreement even within the forces of the majority because I have heard observations quite rightly and that we have perfectly shared from very high representatives of both Forza Italia and the League who criticized a number of choices made first of all on the date of these consultations From this it can be deduced that even within the majority there has been the seriousness and the institutional correctness of agreeing at least within this majority the content of an extremely delicate measure because intervening by decree law on electoral rules albeit secondary is an issue that has always been addressed in the past with due correctness and caution I am referring to the criticisms that have been made of having chosen as the first Sunday of the administrative consultations and the only Sunday of the referendary round the first Sunday with the schools closed in a very hot time of the year with a great invitation to people to go elsewhere to enjoy this first Sunday of vacation without children having to wake up early on Monday and not to go to vote This is a very serious matter because it is a referendum In addition we have returned to vote in one day after during the previous two years of emergency Covid had voted in two days Moreover the emergency still exists for health care and many other categories or for the masks on the means of transport in this case instead the emergency is not there and you can very well vote in one day while in the past from 1946 to 2013 it had always been voted in two days This time we voted in a single day just to say to the people stay away that justice must not be touched because the order came to us which however contrasted with the intentions of some forces of the majority including the League which had promoted the collection of signatures then became a collection of resolutions of the Regional Councils to which also Brothers of Italy participated But that is not enough The decree law is of May 4 and since it was voted on June 12 there was all the time to do as in the past it was done that is to arrive at the time of the vote by a decree law converted into law Let us not forget in fact that the decree law should be a measure to be adopted in the event of extraordinary necessity and urgency and that in the event that it encounters the rejection of Parliament it would decay in its effectiveness from the outset with enormous institutional problems being precisely elections In fact we have been pushed to the opposite end so even the House examined this measure in the House when it was first voted on 12 June We come here today that we have also voted in the second round a truly incredible thing that shows sloppyness and I would almost say an ostentatious contempt for institutional correctness which is extremely dangerous because this contempt for constitutional rules for fairness and for Parliament as a whole has all the air of being wanted Then as if that were not enough we introduce norms some from the beginning even in the original text which have nothing to do with the matter of the decree law and its characteristic of urgency The decree law in its title refers only to rules for the simultaneous conduct of local elections and referendums as well as for the application of operational precautionary and security procedures for the collection of votes Well in Article 6 3 there is a rule concerning the general elections which apparently have not yet been convened even if we would like to and which we read are being done even in May next year with the longest parliamentary term ever at the constitutional limits There is therefore no necessity and urgency and there is no relevance to what should be the text of the decree law so there was already extraneousness of matter from the beginning As if that were not enough Article 6a is introduced in which some political forces are privileged which will be exempted from voting This is not scandalized we have no particular opposition to the fact that other political forces can participate in the vote but it has been done in a totally disproportionate way taking advantage of the monocameralism that in fact against the Constitution the Government has made a granite rule that can never be overcome favouring the House over the Senate so that only one elected to the Chamber is worth more than one Group to the Senate a totally irrational thing It follows that if we vote soon and apply them without corrective measures which I hope there are on the other hand because of the fairness and fairness of the elections these rules really arriving at the elections there would be a risk of an appeal for inconstitutionality that does not resolve in two days because of the obvious unreasonableness of the norm As a single Member does he is worth more than 13 senators who make up a group It is an irrational thing which has nothing to do with sympathy or dislike towards this or that Group on the contrary it is a matter of having respect for the solemn moment of the elections However since rules have also been introduced in this measure concerning the elections we take the opportunity to say that it would be time to vote because it would also be good if voters could say theirs I recall that when President Scalfaro dissolved Parliament in 1994 to vote he did so on the basis of the authoritative opinion of a great constitutionalist Professor Zagrebelsky who said that when Parliament deviates significantly even if we do not extend from the electoral representation there are all the justifications for resolving Parliament and going to new elections Well I would say that all the electoral consultations tell us that the present Parliament is not representative of the electoral reality I 'll add a thought As if that were not enough trust was also placed Another madness there were 15 amendments perhaps 18 of which six judged impossible were actually much more proposable than that amendment introduced to the House concerning the collection of signatures for political elections not even mentioned in the title of this measure which have no characteristic of necessity and urgency Instead of examining these amendments trust is placed because it is now compulsive I 've heard but I 'm not gonna tell who who looks like there 's some kind of addiction to trust They did n't put it on once I 'm in withdrawal crisis now Colleagues you need a little respect I will conclude with a notation In Article 6 paragraph 3 an extension of this experiment of electronic voting is unduly introduced outside the scope of the provision When this concerns Italians abroad we are in favour because the current voting methods for Italians abroad are such that neither secrecy nor fairness are guaranteed Therefore if there is any way to fix this please come along Perhaps we need to rethink the matter more systematically but we can accept it As for all the other situations let 's go very slowly And we ask the government to explain every detail of the expression of this vote because we want it to count the vote of voters and not those who count the vote as Stalin said that the suppression of democracy was meant to be Let 's go very slowly then We will vote against this decree- law for the manner in which it was presented which goes against all correctness and respect of the forms and substance of our institutions and our nation
Mr President we are faced of course with the vote of confidence in order to prevent the individual amendments from being voted on in the light of the sun in front of everyone with a measure that is part of that great operation which is the National Recovery and Resilience Plan The word resilience which I believe was unknown to more than two years ago has now become indispensable as they did in the immediate post war period with the economic boom when they did not know or at least knew it in very few the word resilience The fear is that this word will remain so and the facts will say something else The decree law under consideration is essentially an omnibus measure because apart from the articles that concern the school issue it concerns all the many aspects of public administration which because of its presence its articulation and its importance in our country essentially affects all the sectors of our nation and daily life The examination was obviously difficult and has already started with the intention of violating what the Constitution prescribes namely that both Chambers examine the measure It has also happened in the past that it was only one House that examined a measure because unforeseen events can happen because the examination can continue for some reason or because changes are introduced at first reading but when you start with this idea obviously there is not much already Today it is 21 June the decree expires on 29 June and still has to be sent to the other branch of Parliament to be examined in the Commission then in this House We are talking about fake exams exactly the same as those of the Senate when the same procedure is followed in the House because if I am not mistaken only Wednesday or Thursday that is to say ten or twelve days after the final date of the provision for both readings the numerous amendments have begun to be examined and voted on which is normal for the majority too and I would say above all given the articulation of the measure I wonder how we can really look at such a measure The reason for these delays is certainly not to be found in the conduct of the Commission but I would like to thank Mr Nencini who has carried it out with great capacity trying to keep the helm bar so as to give a certain order to the work as well as the rapporteurs Senator Rojc and Senator Cangini who have done their work with commitment The reason rather is that all decisions are obviously not taken in this House because the question of trust is simply raised there so either in the majority of governments or not even if no one is obliged to join even if he is part of the majority of governments but we know how things are going but not even in the Commission that is the examination takes place elsewhere I would like to take the example of how the work took place yesterday the Commission after several referrals already last Friday was convened at 12 noon and postponed at 12.30 p.m. then at 13.30 at 14.30 then 15.30 after that there was a qualitative leap the delay instead of being an hour became three hours so the sitting was postponed to 18.30 but only at 19.40 when it was finally decided which text to vote on The Commission has therefore voted in favour of the whole area of which it is quite right to say that it is very important namely school in fact liquidating the text in twenty minutes Now we come to this House and it is difficult to know the work that has been done and even the list of the many amendments that have been adopted There are also some proposed by the Brothers of Italy who intervene mainly on the procedures we had proposed many others on substantive issues but obviously it is already quite difficult to agree between the parties of the majority so for the opposition there is little room but I must say that attention has been shown To say however that this is a parliamentary examination is to say what it is not because the examination takes place elsewhere it is the Government that continues to send all the last changes to what it has decided indispensablely and urgently with so much of recourse to the instrument of the decree law which makes the provision immediately effective and in force except then continue to submit corrections until a few days from the extreme deadline indeed we should have sent this text to the House already twenty days ago as well as amendments introducing new elements When it is said that it is necessary to keep up with the urgency of modern life it would be more appropriate to say that the urgency comes from the changes in the government 's idea and from the new found ones but it is not that they are introduced to keep up with the daily difficulties because here there is a problem this PNRR has been written at European level and has been transposed with the procedures due at Italian level when the emergency was generated by the pandemic by Covid with the very heavy reflections that there have been on the economy Our country in fact has had the primacy for the most substantial collapse of the gross domestic product due to the particularly severe measures more severe than in any other country primacy that has been accompanied by the one due to the number of deaths so obviously there has been some problem Today however it is clear that there are at least other emergencies Among other things it is a recovery and resilience plan generated by an emergency of a health nature this is the basis of everything that allocates very limited resources to health care a very small part of these funds while an ageing society in which medical care evolves continuously and with them the costs should still increase the health costs Today we are in a situation where I think we know the emergency generated by the war in Ukraine is energy What do we do We move forward with the old National Recovery and Resilience Plan Brothers of Italy have repeatedly asked the Italian Parliament and the European Parliament to update it as provided for in European procedures as well as of course the freedom that Parliament if it were really there should have But no we have remained with the previous priorities on the contrary we move forward with the old plan that of environmental fundamentalism in which some axioms and dogmas are taken and applied in an uncritical way to the point that in these days when there are problems of much other kind we think of kicking the continental automotive industry with the announcement of the elimination of endothermic engines by 2035 This together with all the other rules of this type will allow China to absorb new production because it will be able to produce more to the detriment of Europe because there is no limitation to emissions and even less to actual pollution Consequently the result of this fine rule will be the increase in global emissions because given that there is talk of a global problem it does not matter whether they occur in China or in Europe We are thus faced with a very harsh confrontation that between fundamentalist ideological visions and reality This is the worst danger that politics can face to exchange and replace the real reality and problems of people it is not a philosophical fact but a question that touches the real problems of people and citizens who find themselves with exorbitant bills and very high costs who close thousands and thousands of companies and activities with ideology in order to run after environmental fundamentalism which in fact goes in the opposite direction both of the economic and practical interests of citizens and even of the protection of the environment
Mr Malan FdI Mr President on Tuesday during the debate on this measure in the presence of the Deputy Minister for Infrastructure I mentioned the fact which I pointed out several times in the questions that there is a senior manager of the Ministry of Infrastructure whose name I am now saying Happy Morisco since it has already been done also by the Vice Minister who for twenty five years at the Ministry or equivalent structures deals with motorway concessions This is clearly contrary to the rotation provided for by the anti-corruption law moreover it has recently signed documents that constitute immense gifts worth billions or otherwise hundreds of millions in favour of motorway dealers This is precisely the condition that anti-corruption law is meant to avoid Deputy Minister Bellanova replied that the position of summit regarding motorway concessions has changed over the years Yeah but I did n't say that I had said that that individual person is signing documents that make huge gifts to motorway dealers for example by granting them 100 percent refreshment from even minimum reductions in turnover in the Covid period while all other companies have at most 10 percent refreshment or 20 percent in some cases I have also stressed the fact that this person has been in that position for twenty five years as can be seen from the curriculum vitae he himself evidently compiled which states that from 1997 to 2011 he has carried out the activity of evaluating the feasibility of the financial plans related to the motorway concessions while in the period 2011 2012 he was manager at the economic and financial analysis unit carrying out activities related to the supervision of the motorway concessions and so on until he is the maximum manager on the motorway concessions Deputy Minister Bellanova also said that if there are questions it will be the Government 's duty to answer them There have been questions for years and the Government is opposed to what Vice President Bellanova herself rightly said to be a specific duty In order not to make a very boring list of numbers I will hand over the list of main questions that have no answer not least because to list them all would go beyond the times that you Mr President are kindly granting me
Mr President representative of the Government fellow Senators in the electoral programme of Brothers of Italy for the policies of 2018 there was a point entitled Contrast to poverty efficient social policies and health protection which included this sentence Inclusion of sport in the Constitution as an essential tool of physical and mental well being value added contrast to youthful deviances and ensuring motor activity from primary school to senior age We are therefore particularly pleased that a point in our programme is being achieved despite the fact that we have been in opposition during these four years of parliamentary term On 6 August 2018 in fact Senators Antonio Iannone and Nicola Calandrini of Fratelli d'Italia presented in line with this point of the program a constitutional bill in this sense in order to include sports practice in the Constitution Last year further draft laws were presented by other Senate Groups and this led to very positive cooperation within the Committee on Constitutional Affairs I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Grimani and all the Members of the Commission for the spirit has really been designed to produce a text that satisfies everyone and is as appropriate effective as possible written in a form appropriate to the Constitution The importance of sports activity in our country has always grown For a long time it has been an activity reserved for a few high income and high level social people who could have some leisure time to devote to sport especially as young people There has been a progressive enlargement thanks also to the top sport which has made known legendary or otherwise well known figures of sport in many areas We know that football is one of the most followed disciplines but at the Olympics for example there is a great general enthusiasm for all sports This is important because it has not only brought extraordinary results which have given great satisfaction to Italians as spectators as well as as as athletes in many sectors in the Olympics and in the great sports competitions but also because it represented a great stimulus for many children and young people who said But then I can do it too They saw the companies of great champions and understood that they could do so too Gradually the awareness that physical and sporting activity is an aspect of education growth and social inclusion has increased and has led to a progressive involvement of increasingly wider parts of our population So the top sport also pulls the basic sport Obviously it is a source of great prestige and satisfaction to see our athletes and our teams achieve great results but this is particularly important when it pushes so many young people to this practice that brings benefits to physical health to the sense of values solidarity and loyalty which are fundamental aspects of sport as well as in terms of inclusion In sport except for episodes of boycotts and closures that I consider not positive there has always been the encounter between athletes of many countries of all social strata and of all political ideas and religions Sport has been a great tool for integration and inclusion For this reason we have been opposed to the exclusion in these years of so many young people which still lasts for medical choices that have often been not theirs but their parents Sport is inclusion and keeping someone out is really against the sport spirit Sport is also included for women girls and girls In fact we know that at the beginning women 's sports practice was greatly hindered and there was a natural skepticism also on the part of families that male children did sports while daughters girls other things If there are health benefits sport must obviously be open to all Here too there has been the phenomenon of great characters of the top sport one of these we have before us and it is the undersecretary Valentina Vezzali who represents the Government who have given the example of extraordinary sporting successes and also of extraordinary humanity These people are not in a separate world but they are part of society they have roles in the family and then maybe they enter political activity This has certainly contributed decisively to the development of sports practice at all levels for both males and females Speaking of women 's sports we can only look with concern at what is happening more and more often and also in Italy even in a less explosive way than what we have seen happen in the United States I refer to gentlemen with all the characteristics from head to toe of males who say they feel female and therefore compete in women 's categories It is an obnoxious and a mockery for women who play sports and engage who find themselves competing with men who in most sports are benefited by their skeletal and muscular structure and their metabolism Brothers of Italy is particularly proud to have contributed decisively starting the discussion that today leads to the inclusion of sport in the Constitution This is not a goal in itself but a further push to make sport increasingly accessible to all For many Italians the sport practice is discreetly and sufficiently accessible but for many others still not There are still too many schools that have completely inadequate gyms or even do not have them and there are many of our young people and children who do not have this possibility Sport must be accessible to all including people with disabilities We have also recently seen summit sport at the Paralympics It is important that athletes who reach high levels encourage people with physical problems to engage in sports practice which for them is perhaps even more beneficial than for others Therefore this inclusion which we naturally hope will be crowned by the adoption of the bill in the subsequent readings that the Constitution provides both as a stimulus and as a stimulus when it comes to allocating resources and taking measures to make sport accessible to all to put ourselves truly committed to the search for the resources that are needed in the certainty that sport must be accessible to all as a means of cohesion and inclusion and as an instrument to place young people in a context that is attentive to values loyalty and self training in the most appropriate way to a true citizen
Mr Malan FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen representative of the Government this draft law comes to the House after a fruitful work done in the Commission and moreover comes from a bill signed by representatives of several groups I would like to thank President Parrini rapporteur for the measure and my colleagues who have contributed to the drafting of this text who responds to a decision of the Constitutional Court that noted the lack of judicial protection in the preparatory proceedings for the elections for the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic The preparatory process in other words is the fundamental passage of presentation of symbols and lists In this way there will be the same guarantees as today with the same speed and in addition there will also be a further possibility of protecting the interests of some formation and party who want to submit lists providing a further opportunity to defend and assert their rights This is not so well known to the general public but certainly very important we know in the past of problematic facts which then have to be addressed as has been said just now even after the electoral result has been achieved that is in times that are obviously no longer adequate At this point what can I say Since the aspect of electoral regulations has also been settled as Brothers of Italy we believe it is appropriate to go and vote and give the Italians the floor This would prevent the Government from having to put its trust in all the measures it presents i.e. the majority of those which Parliament is examining going against what President Mattarella said in his inaugural speech Everyone applauded him and we applauded him on this passage Some people however probably did not understand this because they continue to do exactly what the President has asked them not to do and not for his own personal taste but because the Constitution provides for an important and decisive role for Parliament and indeed entrusts Parliament with the power and power to make laws in accordance with Article 70 of the Constitution For this reason too the Brothers of Italy Group will vote in favour of the draft law under consideration in the hope that the electoral process so modified and perfected can be implemented as soon as possible in order to give the word to the Italians
Mr Malan FdI Mr President after the memory of Senator Carrara so well expressed by you President and Senator Gallone I would like to add a few words Valerio has been a senator for three legislatures and has been in this Chamber for twelve years He arrived unexpectedly but he was able to interpret very well his role as representative of the citizens in general and of his territory to which he was so attached as has been said just now He has always taken with detachment irony and even self irony the successes The fact of having reached the role of senator for a person who has always had the passion of politics and the administration of its territory was certainly a great satisfaction as well as being elected for two other legislatures and becoming president of the Defence Commission which led with capacity and balance They were certainly great successes but they did not change his smiling and conscious attitude of the transitoryness of all the roles held In the same way he was able to deal with the fierce criticisms that were also made in one of the many political conflicts that often happen as it should be in this House I remember as she said earlier her passion for nature for its mountains for its municipality when he was elected mayor with a large majority of votes I remember well that he told me several times having passed through medical and surgical events in similar times After what I 've been through I 've been saved by surgeons in an almost miraculous way everything that comes after me is a great gift and I 'm trying to enjoy it to make it the best in my life Hence his love for his family for his mountains and for nature in which he tried to immerse himself as much as possible moreover living in a mountain country was easier I 've always felt it with great serenity and awareness that he really had to savor these years of his life no matter how long they were Unfortunately they ended a few days ago but we know that we had as a friend and colleague a real person a person who was able to express the sentiment of so many of our fellow citizens who we have the honour to represent here On behalf of the whole Group of the Brothers of Italy I offer my condolences to his family to whom he was so attached remembering him with affection and bearing in our hearts his beautiful memory
Mr Malan FdI Mr President the Brothers of Italy Group will vote in favour of the report of the Assembly of Parliamentary Elections and Immunities sharing its content I shall confine myself to two notes the first of which is irrelevant to the content of what we are examining What Senator Crucioli said must be taken seriously That Senator Giarrusso cannot participate as always in a discussion that concerns him personally on matters completely unrelated to parliamentary life is a very problematic fact and those who vote on certain measures should ask questions that are then almost inevitably reflected on the dynamics of the Senate Let me turn to the second point We are voting in favour of indisputability because it is a prerogative of Parliament to defend not the person and not even the individual senator but the institutions It is precisely for this reason however that those who hold parliamentary posts should avoid statements such as the one we are dealing with which have undoubtedly unjustly offended people and their families Therefore the sense of responsibility must be remembered We must remember that we have rightful prerogatives as Members of Parliament but this must lead to great caution before making personal attacks against which we in order to protect the institutions avoid the parliamentary judicial consequences that can be very onerous However I repeat the sense of responsibility must be recalled when certain statements are made
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I take the floor to briefly express the vote in favour of the Fratelli d'Italia Group on the rapporteur 's proposal adding one aspect In the order with which the judge for preliminary investigations rejected the request to dismiss the prosecutor made already abnormal in itself comes in some way albeit in an unclear and explicit way used the fact that in the comments to what Senator Candiani posted on Facebook there have been expressions of hatred and so on Well I would say that we must keep a clear distinction between what the parliamentarians say parliamentary or non-parliamentary and the reactions that this can provoke from those who follow this social media because we know that in social media it is sometimes enough simply to say something good morning to all to bring in the most weird exaggerated and exacerbated comments Therefore this division must absolutely be preserved which cannot lead to consequences I am referring to what others comment on what one says
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I shall be very brief It has been argued that these opinions are not expressed because among the accusations there is that of the threats aimed at disturbing the activity of an administrative body in this case the prefect of Modena Let 's see what these threats would be because undoubtedly the threats as the penal code describes them are different from the expression of an opinion What are the threats According to the prosecutor the pressure and threats would consist as I read from the report in the presentation of statements to the judicial authority combined with parliamentary actions Is trusting the judicial authorities and exposing what is happening to them interpreted as a threat I remember that the latter is the threat of unjust damage otherwise even saying that it is being sued would be a threat An exposure to the judicial authority would be a threat of unjust harm and would imply the view of the judicial authority as a sort of armed gang at the service of Senator Giovanardi The other threats would be those of parliamentary action I would say that it is difficult to say what is more parliamentary than parliamentary action Summing up exposed to the judicial authority parliamentary actions and the other threat would be a press conference in which the senator would say plague and horns of the prefect You 'll have the right to say it then if you make false or unfounded accusations it 's another matter A Member will have the right however not only to express his opinion but to do so with a view to the judicial authorities and press conferences If the press conference is considered to be a threat of unjust harm as Senator Quagliariello said earlier we could all be accused by doing a minimum of activity A further threat would be specific press conferences to criticize the work of the prefecture Of course if there had been something unfair in these criticisms such as slanders it would be another matter To think that exposing making press conferences parliamentary actions and exposed to the judicial authority is a crime other than the crime of opinion could lead very far and totally limit the activity of a Member who simply has to come here vote say nothing or say good of everyone and not work when he believes that there are unjust actions against in this case an important company with 100 employees Among other things in essence it has been seen that Senator Giovanardi has always been right even before the judicial authority I therefore believe that there should be no doubt in voting as the Brothers of Italy will do in favour of the rapporteur 's proposal freeing the indisputability as expressed by Senator Giovanardi
"Mr Malan FdI Mr President this bill stems from various parliamentary initiatives in the House and one of those measures is by Brothers of Italy The need to change many norms within the local authorities has been felt very much in Parliament the Group of Brothers of Italy has promoted it and has contributed to the promotion of this bill Unfortunately however then he intervened and this is not new because other governments have already done so the scare of a government bill for the overall reform of the single text of the local authorities The good result of this announcement is that most of the proposals are stopped because you have to wait for the government bill There are sketches on the Internet but they have not been officialized in any way let alone transmitted to the Senate which is the other branch of Parliament dating back to October So after six months now almost seven we 're still standing still and we do n't know where it 's gonna go The draft law we are dealing with today therefore carries forward some requirements that have been proposed but much less than those that would have been needed The proposed law of Brothers of Italy provided for a very important thing that is to put an end to the truly embarrassing situation that exists in the Provinces and especially in the metropolitan cities where there is not the popular vote nor the universal suffrage of the citizens but the complex vote in which only mayors and councilors are involved who deserve all our respect and gratitude for the great work they do day by day in the administration a job that has no breaks has no public holidays has no reserved hours and requires a great commitment However if we are in a democratic situation the Provinces and Metropolitan Cities should also be elected by all citizens Then there is a paradoxical situation frankly unconstitutional in my opinion in the metropolitan areas where the citizens of the capital decide who is the so called metropolitan mayor which would then be the new name of the President of the Province also for the municipalities of the whole Province something that is not standing I take the example of my Province Turin which has 800,000 inhabitants who decides who will be the metropolitan mayor of 300 others and passes Municipalities which have among them more than a million inhabitants This is a very unacceptable situation We had carried this point forward with force But then with the excuse that perhaps a government bill would arrive with the fact that someone defends paradoxically this reform completely sudden also because in its time it voted our proposal has been put aside and there are only a few rules left We facilitated the process of this which became a bill to the Senate so that the Senate could express itself But we are not satisfied with all the work done and therefore we express a vote of abstention recalling and emphasizing our great appreciation and the great importance that we attach to the work that is done in local authorities in the Provinces in the metropolitan areas and in the municipalities where thousands of citizens have a basic commitment to volunteering but fundamental for the administration of the territory for many services guaranteed to citizens in small and large municipalities"
Mr Malan FdI Mr President your communications reveal the situation we are in which is indeed that of a Constitution that has been bypassed and a Parliament that has been reset mocked and I would say insulted Mr President you spoke it is certainly not your fault of two decree laws which were brought to the attention of Parliament as it were on 24 and 30 December We are still waiting to start voting on 26 November on the same subject In other words Parliament has not yet been able to express its opinion on the Decree Law of 26 November which rains over those of 24 and 30 December and now the media of the regime are preparing the way for a further fearful decree with hallucinating measures which is announced for 5 or 7 January This is in the total impossibility of Parliament to say its own even on the 26th of November largely surpassed by all the measures that are introduced day by day desired and imposed through the media when countries that have greater respect for their Constitution which is not written as in the case of the United Kingdom are abolishing the few restrictions they had In addition to this the Ministers who lie Minister Hope lies here in this House about his interest in blocking the World Health Organization 's investigation Minister Lamorgese lies in the Commission saying that it is not true that policemen are suspended from their salaries even if they are absent or pregnant Someone said that with the super green pass pardon just the green pass you have the certainty to be among people who are infected who do not infect Added to this is the systematic continued and aggravated failure to answer all questions on all Covid issues I have just presented one now about the fact that from both the United Kingdom and Denmark the one in Denmark which is particularly important because it is based on the data of the entire population and the data of the United Kingdom based on the official data of the health agency of that country it appears that vaccines after a certain period have a negative effect Here is a doctor whom I thank for being present as a representative of the Government is unusual the presence of a representative of the Government in a session like this negative effectiveness should make the hands of those who are going to vote on further obligations of this type tremble I ask the government to remember that there is a Constitution that there is a Parliament and that there is the health of the citizens in the middle You can't joke you can't force yourself
Mr Malan FdI Mr President this amendment by Brothers of Italy proposes the introduction of tax treatment to the family in proportion to the number of its members with modulations for the spouse the first the second and the third children This is what is known as a family quotient The birth rate has been steadily falling for thirteen years during which a negative record has been recorded each year for a number of reasons that are not just economic Where you can intervene is here We really need a jump and a strong change in this respect Small measurements or even facades are not enough We have already seen that the famous universal single family allowance beautiful thing especially in the title is not actually universal and in many cases we speak of hundreds of thousands of families perhaps millions means having less than before We need strong measures not these measures Today a family a couple or even single parents with children receive from the State in terms of deductions and benefits much less than what they have to pay in terms of VAT alone on what they have to buy for children It must also be considered that a family with children needs a bigger car also because not all Italians live in the ZTL where maybe everything is within reach of a short walk and a larger house which is then calculated to establish the income ISEE Therefore one risks getting out of these parameters because having a family composed for example of four instead of two people one needs larger spaces It can not be said that there is no money because as Senator Pillon said well if we lack resources for our future i.e. children who are the adults of tomorrow why should we use them for other things Is it more right to support families with children or find billions to give Benetton for the highway business Just in these days the Ministry of Sustainable Infrastructure and Mobility has signed a document with which Autostrade for Italy is refunded to 100 of the missed collections cause Covid while we know very well that thousands of companies have received 6 1 or 10 percent Is it better to find money for children or for the income of citizenship with all its crooks such as the incentive not to work Is it better to find 5 or 10 euros a day even less with a family quotient for families or find 200 euros a day for children who are taken away from families and given to family homes In many cases these are justified acts but in many others we see the consequences in phenomena such as that of the Bible Unfortunately there is not only Biblical but there are hundreds thousands of cases that the parliamentary committees also deal with If you do n't find the money for these things and find them for much more it means that our future is not what we would like Instead Brothers of Italy wants our future to be based on families who have children and who can raise them in serenity and not in narrowness Today the difference between those who have children and those who do not have children with a low average income is between living discreetly and having really enormous difficulties to get to the end of the month This can not be tolerated
Mr Malan FdI Mr President this amendment by Brothers of Italy calls for an extension of the period of maternity leave after childbirth to one hundred and eighty days It would be a concrete and precise act to meet the needs of mothers and whole families Evidently a child between three and six months of age needs a lot of care certainly cannot be left alone and having someone to take care of him involves costs I therefore believe this to be a perfectly reasonable proposal I would also point out that even now the state of emergency for Covid 19 then we have other states of emergency mothers who belong to categories of workers subject to the vaccination obligation there are several are deprived of the maternity allowance although they are on compulsory maternity leave if they have not complied with the terms of vaccination second and third dose This is a completely unjustified issue because the sense of these vaccination obligations is to avoid infection at the workplace since it is believed that these categories have a particular danger of contagion But a mother who is at home on maternity leave what danger does she pose to her colleagues Now the fact of depriving a mother of her livelihood and there are even single mothers I do n't think that there is a need to remember it but one forgets it when voting certain laws without any justification from the point of view of contagions I really find it unacceptable I have never been able to talk about this in this House because there has always been confidence in those measures but this is an opportunity to talk about it We cannot pretend to help families when aberrant standards are adopted against mothers who have children
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I am voting in favour of this draft ratification law by the Brothers of Italy Group as well as the others that we shall be examining with the exception of Qatar on which I shall be asking for the floor
Mr President we are not at all reassured by the speech made by my colleague because Article 6a of the agreement which is ratified by the possible adoption of the draft law clearly states that for crimes disconnected from the service our military and it is not an abstract hypothesis but very concrete because there is a mission in place with Italian soldiers engaged there are subject to the courts of Qatar with the possibility that they may pay the penalty in Italy I remember as has already been said that in Qatar homosexuality is a crime and so is adultery which in Arabic is called by the generic name zina which basically indicates disordered sexual conduct This means that if two Italian soldiers have sexual intercourse and are not married they are committing this crime which is certainly not connected to their mission Therefore they would be subject to Qatari justice which provides for a severe penalty once there was also stoning now we can be reassured because we reach only a maximum of one hundred lashes and seven years of imprisonment We can assume that if the sentence is taken for granted in Italy the lashes are abounded but the seven years of imprisonment even if it is taken for granted in Italy does not really seem a reassuring thing to me We are so ready to recognize the rights of homosexuals sexual freedom and so on but then we consider here a very negligible fact that the Italian military in Qatar not by their own will obviously but sent on mission by the Italian Government can be subjected to such penalties At present there are also several others because Qatar 's main source of law is sharia which also includes beheadings amputations and so on In the face of these things I do not think it is enough to abstain We must vote against but I would urge the Government to reconsider to request a postponement and to negotiate again with the Qatari authorities another type of agreement We do not want to go against a treaty that exists but we can not even vote for it The best thing would be for the government to withdraw it and ask for a postponement avoiding this controversy because we usually manage to be united on the Armed Forces In fact we must all defend the men and women who go on mission to Italy You must not force us to vote against or otherwise
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I rise to ask the answer to a series of questions on the issue of Motorways for Italy a business promoted by environments of the Ministry of Infrastructure then variously called which involves a theft to the detriment of motorists and all those who use the highways and therefore practically of all because the goods we buy in the shops pass in great part through the highways and that will instead benefit the managers of the highways that have had such a disastrous management to see the collapse of the Morandi bridge The specific responsibilities of that disaster are being investigated by the judiciary but the lack of maintenance is evident and proven then the bridge may have collapsed unfortunately but it is in fact that on the tolls of the highways will be loaded at least eight billion more than the largest of the figures that could be imagined to give to Mr Benetton and to Atlantia As if that were not enough while doing that at the Ministry without the authorization of anyone of a paragraph of an agenda it was decided to refund to Autostrade for Italy 100 percent of the difference of receipts that there was in 2019 compared to the receipts of 2020 And this for Covid when hundreds of thousands of Italian companies have been reimbursed 2 5 10 0 percent and even late being in many cases forced to close Is it possible that for the first three months only more than 500 million are to be taken away from the Italians when hundreds of thousands of companies have closed down or are in serious difficulty because they have received virtually no restaurants We 're talking about companies that have n't had less receipts like highways but they 've had zero receipts in fact they 've only had the expenses because when a restaurant forbids to open it 's not that it can arrange to cash in anyway On the other hand the highways continued to collect and on the whole collected more than was laid down in the financial plans This has been deliberately ignored by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport now sustainable mobility without answering questions This is indeed an insult to Parliament and to the Italians However not answering questions is wrong and I expect that there will be action by the Senate because answering questions is not a faculty or a courtesy but a simple act of compliance with the Rules of Procedure Not only is there no answer to the uncomfortable questions but there is an operation of tens of billions without even informing the Senate this really is an insult to Parliament the Senate and the Italians
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I am speaking on the order of business with regard to what Mr Parrini has said I recall that this decree law of 26 November which introduces compulsory vaccination for police school staff and other measures was largely exceeded by the decree laws of 24 and 30 December and 7 January The amendments were tabled with a deadline not extended of 14 December Since then it has been twenty nine days and we have not yet been able to begin the examination of the amendments because we must agree with the majority We were supposed to start work at 3:00 yesterday There has been a delay to this day for this reason but at 9 a .m. we did not even have a second discussion about the absence of the government There was clearly no intention since the representative of the Government who had every right to stay wherever he wanted was in the corridor outside the Commission 's courtroom The Constitution and decency say that the laws are discussed in the House or in the Commission in front of the citizens with a record and not in endless negotiations in the majority or in the context of whomever you want This is fine it is normal that it should happen but a minimum of decency should be respected in time because these measures have a huge impact on the lives of Italians and cannot be discussed in the corridors to the total detriment of the possibility of examining them where they can be voted where the Constitution stipulates that we should vote in the Commission and in the House In fact it does not escape that it seems that the discussion of the decree law is going to be exhausted today because tomorrow there is no sitting It is all reserved for the corridor and nothing arrives in its own institutional headquarters in a situation in which moreover we examine a decree law that has been largely exceeded by all the others if not for some details on which they manage to nail themselves All right I can also understand the problems of the majority but it is done in accordance with timetables decency and the need to examine measures in the Commission and in this House not in corridors not in private negotiations or in private negotiations
In the same previous spirit with the intention of establishing the conditions for moving forward Article 7 provides that the prefects shall draw up a report on the activity carried out for the control of green passes by all the Forces of the Order in coordination with the local police and so on Now because the control of green passes is not the only problem in our country if this is to be done with our amendments we propose several measures while the report is omitted because if there is a minimum of confidence in the prefects perhaps it is better to let them work rather than make them produce cards with great use of the copy and paste from one side to the other At least it could be expected that instead of weekly the report is monthly to have a little less bureaucracy since apparently the only problem of public order in our country is the lack of green passes But the proposal we are most concerned with is that the report not only concerns the control of green passes but also the whole of the activities carried out to protect citizens and to respect the laws highlighting in this area the extent of the controls referred to in the previous period namely the famous control of green passes If you run after all green passes but drug dealing continues to be a free market commercial abuse is on all roads including those of the Capital a few steps away from the palaces of the institutions the rave parties continue to hold themselves with such laxity that they also come from abroad to celebrate these orgies of drugs and not only with rapes and sometimes even murders well it would be appropriate to keep that in mind too because the green pass should not be the only problem
Mr Malan FdI Mr President Amendment 1.24 and a number of other subsequent amendments call for the measures dictated by the emergency to be equated so much so that they are explicitly justified as such in the premises and are part of a decree law which by definition must be of extraordinary necessity and urgency We do not understand why these and other rules introduced by the provision often last until 15 June when at the time of the enactment of the decree law the state of emergency ended long before and now ends anyway on 31 March Evidently there is a tendency to end emergency never
Mr Malan FdI Mr President Article 2 introduces the vaccination obligation for categories such as police forces in which there are several cases and one which is quite well known I am referring to the Marshal of the special departments of the Carabinieri in service in Codogno in February March 2020 who has endangered his life even if the Carabiniere must obey the orders in the conditions we know then the disease was unknown and was considered even more dangerous than it then turned out to be Yet it was very dangerous and we know well how many deaths there have been in that area in particular with a mortality that even reached 7 10 percent of the infected These are the conditions in which this marshal worked Since at that time he contracted the disease from which he was cured he felt that he was not reunited during this period and consequently was suspended from service I say this to outline the picture Amendment 2.29 at the first signature of Senator Rauti and others at the first signature of Senator Iannone and at my first signature go in the same direction If the vaccination obligation for the police forces and for the other categories for which it is intended serves to contain the contagions despite the very poor results which I would call failures in recent months then it is necessary for the people who actually go to work and therefore are in contact with colleagues or other people and not already for those who are at home on sickness or maternity leave It is good to know that despite the fact that Mr Lamorgese answered one of my questions in the Commission saying that this was not the case this is the case You must know that if a woman who is pregnant or on compulsory maternity leave is not vaccinated her salary is suspended even if she may be the only livelihood she has I repeat this is true even if it is at home and has no contact with colleagues Firstly there is a lack of motivation Secondly I find that taking away the livelihood of a woman in maternity even if she was a dangerous criminal is something I avoid defining with the word I have in mind simply saying that it should not be done on matters of elementary humanity I 'll add one more element We have tabled these amendments all of which have been rejected without any explanation The Budget Committee has given an opinion against Article 81 of the Constitution arguing that if these amendments were to pass extra money would have to be taken out to give the salary to the maternity women involved This means therefore that these women must not vaccinate because otherwise there is no cover Is n't that right Mr. and Mrs. Budgetary Committee Even if they were to vaccinate there would be no resources to pay their wages Then the government is saying that these women are deprived of their livelihood but that if they are vaccinated there is no money Actually here we go beyond any limit of logic and frankly even of elementary humanity
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I would like to vote in favour of this amendment We would also like a further extension but this amendment reabsorbed the 2.0.5 text 3 which was submitted to the Commission by the Brothers of Italy which is why we will vote in favour so that at least for these categories there is a paid permit on the day on which they are subjected to the vaccine
Mr Malan FdI Mr President I rise in an explanation of vote on this first signed amendment by Senator La Pietra which calls for the exemption of small island residents alone in the region Here we have paradoxical effects which have already been illustrated of people who cannot go to the hospital because they do not have the green pass There are islands where there is not even a place to swab inside the island and therefore the inhabitants must take a public means to go to another island or to go to the Continent to the mainland There are even cases of people who would like to make the vaccine but they can't take the ferry to get the vaccine because they did n't make the vaccine These are paradoxical issues which deserve some attention because they concern real people
Mr President Mr President in Office of the Government my fellow senators this Conference on the future of Europe is a very curious operation I wonder how many people outside of the staff were really interested in it It has certainly not been an issue of widespread discussion among people and citizens but also among those who are actively involved in politics It was supposed to be an experiment in the exercise of participatory democracy but it showed many shadows and doubts about the reliability of all procedures and the viability of the proposals received and formulated The working methods were to summon 800 citizens chosen by a company specializing in market surveys by a so called random method In other words it is a company specialized in seeing what consumers are looking for in a product in order to make it easier for the products themselves to be sold it is something quite different from coordinating people however chosen at random as they say to formulate proposals that are absolutely political There have not been a lot of complaints and concerns shared by many MEPs national parliamentarians and members of national governments who have also noted a lack of attention to procedures and even the impossibility to verify that the citizens since they are meetings remotely really followed the work One of the interesting things is that although the Italian population is 14 of the population of the European Union only 22 of the 800 participants are Italian i.e. less than 3 Compared with 14 percent of the population less than 3 percent of the participants are Italian Who knows why You do n't know So these 800 participants of which 22 Italians were divided into panels using this term also in the Italian version because apparently the words commission or working group were considered unfit to express the concept in our language These four panels have therefore developed the beauty of 368 proposals called recommendations It is rather difficult to understand how people chosen at random who do not meet physically without voting this is another peculiarity can come up with proposals It is therefore clear that most of the work was done by the organisation whose presidency was under the auspices of the Presidency of the European Commission the Presidency of the European Council and the Presidency of the European Parliament which in turn appointed three representatives one French one Belgian and one Croatian The final approval will always take place without votes so we do not understand how at the plenary session that has yet to be held so the proposals have theoretically not yet been approved although it is clear that these 368 recommendations will be because given the particular mechanisms with which they have already been drawn up they will be approved on Friday and Saturday It is therefore interesting to read these 368 proposals which are all really without excluding one aimed at widening the powers of the European Union or assuming functions that are now national states or local authorities or imposing new constraints new rules and new conditions on citizens and businesses Parliaments and national governments are mentioned very few times and only to say what they must be required to do Let me give some examples among the proposals which end up seeming almost unanimous there are euthanasia marriage regardless of sex and with a curious expression adulthood which I do not quite understand what it means but I hope does not mean what I fear and of course adoption regardless of who forms these families There is a craving to teach European citizens how to think because there are campaigns that rather than information are used to educate citizens to think in a certain way as is explicitly stated We do not think that this is the function of the European Union we believe that it must exploit the extraordinary qualities that the Member States have starting with Italy and not standardize them in an indistinct grayness
"Mr President the decree law we are debating comes to us with a procedure which although it is now customary does not make it less unacceptable The Constitution provides for the examination by both rooms but now it turns out that it is impossible while until a couple of years ago it was possible It was always done during the first republic and during the second republic the vast majority of decree laws were actually examined by both chambers almost always without trust Now instead it is clear that a second real reading is impossible because the House held this decree law for fifty of the sixty days within which it must be converted into law so you arrive here and you can no longer say anything The bicameralism which is written in the Constitution and which has been confirmed by a referendum is trampled on It can happen sometimes in the great moment of the emergency in spring 2020 there could also be this reason but the fact that this practice is based on all arguments is truly unacceptable We were all there when the newly re-elected President Mattarella said in his inaugural speech that it is necessary to avoid the compression of the prerogatives of Parliament then of the House and of the Senate and that they must be valued We have all applauded but then among those who applaud there are those who continue to promote this unacceptable way of proceeding against the Constitution Coming to the merits we are now discussing on 17 May the terms expired or restored on 30 April so we are doing a job on the past But who really has the head turned to the past is the Government which continues to establish restrictions that are almost unique in the world paying no attention neither to what happens abroad nor to the Italian experiences nor to the numbers that government bodies find and spread This decree- law which is christened Riaperture should actually be called Richiusure In fact a number of measures which would have expired are prolonged the vaccination obligation for the whole health sector is extended until December the use of masks is extended until 15 June I have a specific question for the government representatives Strangely here there is always the absolute extraordinary need and urgency to approve these decrees but the Minister Hope never sees it Of course all respect to the representatives of the Government to the Undersecretary Sileri who is present with the other Undersecretary but if the Minister showed that it is also important for him and not only to impose obligations limits and prohibitions on Italians it would not be bad So maybe you could explain to us why you lied to Parliament to cover up your failure to renew the pandemic plan I remember that tens of thousands of people died during the pandemic Perhaps someone less would have died if there had been an updated pandemic plan rather than a nearly 20 year old one Perhaps this should be done by the Minister as well as imposing limits and prohibitions I have a question to ask all the members of the government who go abroad where now the obligation of masks is no longer there in some countries there has never been They go abroad without masks and then they come back here and impose them on others In particular at the Brussels Summit two months ago the President of the Council Mr Mario Draghi the Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Luigi Di Maio and all the others present Mr Biden Chancellor Scholz the President of the European Commission Mr Ursula von der Leyen and all the other world summits attended the meeting without mask either outdoors or indoors There was no particular gap on the contrary kisses and hugs All without a mask two months ago I then have a very specific question to ask I spoke too well of Undersecretary Sileri who is now gone There 's only one undersecretary left very busy in phone conversations However I would like the rapporteur and above all the representative of the Government to reply to this simple question why does the President of the Draghi Council go to the international summits without a mask and embrace people even of a certain age He himself is not very young and therefore there is a greater risk Then however he comes here and obliges six year olds even if they go to childhood school to put on the mask until June 15th Where 's the criterion Because when there was that meeting in Belgium it was not an exception made for the occasion In Belgium for months as almost all over the world there is no obligation to wear a mask Just as there is no obligation not to put it If President Draghi thinks the mask serves to reduce and counter the pandemic why did n't he put it on He was free to put it on and instead he did n't put it on Then he comes here and forces six year olds to wear a mask I want an answer Given that the Government will place trust I ask Minister Hope because it would be nice for him to come and put trust or in any case to Minister D'Incà who will probably be present to answer this very simple question I remember that there are studies that talk about the possible negative consequences of the use of masks It is evident that it increases the reinspiration of carbon dioxide something much is said about other purposes It is evident that it causes effects that make people uncomfortable and even skin irritations In the educational field it greatly reduces the interaction with the teacher being able to see in the face the teacher and for the teacher to see the students is very important Otherwise if the mask were useful we 'd always keep the mask Just remember that Dr. Giovanni Rezza director of the prevention sector of the Ministry of Health wrote a letter in response to those who asked him saying that he is not in possession of studies that demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the masks Let 's remember that this virus is very mutated At first the situation was very different Now with these variants which are far less deadly but are much more contagious from many studies it appears that there is no difference On the Cochrane library which is a large database of researches an accurate study was published which explains that it was not possible to demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of surgical masks compared to their non-use nor has a clear difference been demonstrated between the surgical mask and the FFP2 mask This is just one example A few days ago a study by Professor Beny Spira came out in which he even says that according to some analyses the number of people infected is greater where the mask is used more This among other things is the case of Italy which has worse numbers than others and obligations equal to no other country Finally on 22 July last President Draghi said that with the green pass there would be the security of being among people who are not contagious and therefore not infected His claim that he never denied and for which he never apologized was denied 5,181,909 times Since that day this is the number of Italians who have infected themselves with the Covid 19 despite having the requirements for the green pass In fact they are even more because there are another 2,300,000 infected among those who had done two doses for more than four months Since the green pass lasts six months and until 31 January it lasted even nine months probably there are many more Of these remaining only to those who have three or more doses of vaccine or two doses for less than four months 62,000 have ended up in hospital 3,000 in intensive therapies and 9,805 have died Perhaps someone thought that they would no longer observe prudential behavior since they had the green pass and that the President of the Council had said that we were safe So when you communicate on such matters you do n't have to make propaganda you have to tell the truth This is what we ask truth PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator Parrini is enlisted to speak You have the right to do so"
Mr President I would like to thank the President Senator Urso for what he has inevitably explained to us in summary terms because given the richness and the wide and important series of issues dealt with his oral report which complements what has already been written could only be a summary in summary terms I would also like to thank all the members of the Committee for their work which is obviously particularly important in this case both as a team and as a municipality because it must be common interest in national security One of the most important aspects that emerges from this report and also in general of intelligence activity is that of cybersecurity cybersecurity This is an increasingly important aspect because technology enters the everyday life of everyone and more importantly it is essential in the everyday life of companies institutions and our armed forces As I said it is therefore an extremely important aspect to the point that NATO has made it clear that the basic rule of the North Atlantic Treaty from an organisational point of view Article 5 which requires all Member States to intervene in defence of one of them if attacked should apply also in the event of cyber attacks and not only in the case of the classic military attacks for which there was obviously no doubt This is an extremely important aspect because a computer attack can cause serious damage in a country it can paralyse economic sectors and it can cause serious damage in the finance sector since obviously the computer tool is now indispensable even in the smallest of banking branches it can block the distribution of energy it can block aqueducts In the report on which we have heard the Committee president 's oral integration and which is at our disposal this issue is dealt with in a broad way The National Agency for Cybersecurity has just been set up and for which as I pointed out on that occasion I believe there is a need for much greater ambitions one cannot think of creating a small bureaucratized agency with some executive appointed on the basis of more political than technical reasoning in an area like this which would be reductive to define competitive When computer engineers practice to become more and more good more and more able to respond to the security needs of the companies or institutions in which they work or work they simply compete with each other and divide into two teams on the one hand someone tries to violate the security of that bank or that agency and on the other hand someone else tries to defend security and wins the best Whoever defends himself of course has greater margins as in all sectors but wins the best It is clear therefore that having someone who is good who is good who has listened to something cybersecurity is of no use because in this duel the opponent is potentially obviously not always of a very high level More attention must therefore be paid to this bearing in mind that cybersecurity must not only be passive but also able to act that is to say it must not only be able although this of course is essential to defend itself as effectively as possible against attacks violations of secrecy and even data retention but it must also be able and credible in carrying out counterattack actions because that is what happens The experts in the sector explain that there is a chance that sooner or later an attack will be successful and if we are only defending ourselves of course those who attack that is those who try to enter the computer systems try and try again and if it succeeds it has won because it knows that it will not have reactions Unfortunately many experts point out that Italy is particularly weak in this respect The Cybersecurity Agency is a step forward but it is a little too little and needs to be enhanced in its quality and also in its ability to react In no way should this aspect be underestimated Let us remember that one of the main ways in which cyber attacks take place is the so called ransomware that is an attack in exchange for a ransom they steal data from an important institution for example from a bank and they ask for a more or less substantial amount of money to return them because the quickest way of realizing for those who have stolen data unless they have done so as in some cases for industrial economic or other espionage purposes is precisely to get money given by the institution whose confidentiality has been violated The institution that is the victim has an interest in not letting it know because otherwise its image is damaged Therefore the fact that there is no news of this type of attack does not mean that this kind of attack has not already happened and unfortunately in some cases there may have been some successes We therefore need a great deal of attention in this respect The work done by our intelligence services and the Republic Security Committee itself is therefore extremely important although by its very nature it tends to be obscure I would like to mention another aspect which I find very interesting in the report the question of state secrecy There have been several requests from Parliament to overcome the secret of state on certain aspects much has been said about the issue of the serious attack on the synagogue the great Jewish temple of Rome when in 1982 a child was killed and there were several wounded including the brother of this child Well there have been very disturbing circumstances on the issue that is that no kind of protection had been sent precisely on that evening although there have been reports of the concrete and imminent danger of a terrorist activity precisely to the detriment of the Jewish community at the most solemn moment of their life that is the functions in the synagogue The secret of state is understandable and one of the resources that the state must have but there is a discipline and a law that say when by whom and how the secret of state should be placed Lately we have a similar attitude as on state secrecy to the purely commercial and economic operations carried out by the Extraordinary Commissioner for the management of the pandemic and we have tabled agendas to ask for clarity on all economic operations for the purchase of materials and services Well we have been told that we cannot respond on matters of confidentiality Too bad there is a law the anti-corruption law that much has been talked about and which has been given much importance which says that public administration expenditure must be made known promptly for issues of transparency and to combat corruption except where there is state secrecy When there is no state secret there must be transparency The instrument of state secrecy is important but the instrument of transparency and clarity in relations between the citizen and public administration is very important in democracy
Mr President on the subject of the technical aspects of the measure Senator Ruspandini will speak for the Brothers of Italy Group during the explanation of vote and has already spoken to Senator De Bertoldi in whose speech I fully acknowledge including the part concerning the verbal assaults of Mr Quartapelle on Mr Meloni I am not going to go into the matter otherwise quite rightly the Presidency would come back to me I want to stress three aspects of the measure It is a delegation to the Government that gives it wide discretion I take the example of the paragraph that has been added in the course of examination in the Commission by which the government is delegated to revise the competences of the national anti-corruption authority in the matter of public contracts which is extremely generic Of course we all hope that it will do it well but I would say that the Government should first of all implement what the law already states in addition to what the delegation requests The law is based among other things on fundamental principles of national and European law such as legality transparency competition and the need not to meet as specifically mentioned infringement proceedings by the European Union which has very precise rules in competition matters and already has a number of times Italy has stumbled into infringement procedures which represent costs as well as a loss of credibility for our nation I give very concrete examples where however these principles are not applied Let 's start with the infringement procedure In 2007 the government tried to extend the Brescia Padova motorway without any reason except to keep the same operator We are talking about an extremely profitable motorway which produces profits that are close to half the income there are practically no other legal sectors where there are such gains The European Union opened a procedure because it said that it was not justifiable to extend an important concession if not accompanied by some strong motivation such as the implementation of a new treaty Great The Executive of the time the second Prodi Government added what reason for the extension of the completion of the Valdastico Nord Motorway to connect Brescia Padova to the Brennero Motorway In the text which was approved in Parliament a clause was also rightly included in order to avoid any failure to comply with what was said and by 30 June 2013 the final complete draft of the new treaty should have been presented Well the project has never been presented and I say never Two months before that deadline in the spring of 2013 a preliminary therefore not definitive project was presented so it could not be built even a centimeter of road I repeat a preliminary draft of one of the two lots of which the highway had to compose Well on the basis of that project a very high executive of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport now also sustainable mobility established that it was satisfied with the provisions of the Convention which instead demanded a completely different thing and therefore the concession was extended until 2026 i.e. for twenty years from the original deadline The even more insane thing is that that decision of the CIPE today CIPESS because it has added sustainable development has been definitively cancelled by the Council of State In other words it was extended until 2026 and this was the case in 2018 the concession for a motorway with profits of about one hundred million per year all paid by motorists certainly not raining from the sky on the basis of a document totally unfit to satisfy what the law approved in Parliament provided a document that was definitively cancelled by the Council of State The interested parties i.e. the management of the motorway which happened in the meantime to have ended up under the heel of Atlantia Benetton they are obviously among the needy to whom the Government must make gifts have lodged an appeal in Cassation against the annulment of the Council of State that the Cassation rejected by charging the expenses I have tabled a number of questions on this and the Government has never answered them I would remind you that we are talking here about transparency and that answering questions is the duty of the Government not a kind faculty that is exercised once in a while when someone insists just read the Rules of Procedure of the Senate which obviously is similar to that of the other branch of Parliament I wonder where transparency is in this case with a substantially and materially changed concession in its content without even informing Parliament even when requested even though it was passed by law Where then are transparency and legality Speaking of legality who is that executive who kindly approved this gift to the poor Atlantia Benetton I do n't name it because it's not a personal matter it 's definitely a good person but it 's doing things that have nothing to do with the law The anti-corruption law which is the one establishing the National Anti-corruption Authority ANAC whose powers are changed through a delegation to the Government by the draft law under consideration provides that there is a rotation in all positions of the public administration that may be subject to danger of corruption A gentleman who with a signature can move hundreds and hundreds of millions of euros here or there should probably be subject to rotation This gentleman has always been in the same sector since 1997 that of motorway concessions and he does things like the one I 've illustrated All this has been the subject of questions to which no answer has ever been given This same leader who continues to stand there against the anti-corruption law since the last century it has a certain effect to think of it and in the century that has just begun he has also done something else always in the name of legality and correctness We know well that the restaurant for companies damaged by the pandemic by Covid 19 works in this way there must have been a reduction of at least 33 of the turnover the refreshment can not exceed 20 of the turnover itself and 10 if you are above a certain percentage of turnover Therefore the share is between 10 and 20 percent if there has been a 33 reduction Thousands of companies have failed because these measures have proved to be insufficient in many cases well the manager himself who against the anti-corruption law has been for twenty five years in this area a little delicate and above all from the high economic and financial value has decided after consulting the interested that is the beneficiaries that the highway dealers are given a refreshment of 100 percent even if there is not a reduction of the turnover that reaches 33 percent that happens is exactly what happens with Autostrade for Italy of Atlantia Benetton There would be a lot more to say but I only have ten minutes These events have been going on for years on which the Government does not respond regularly to questions The Government which receives a delegation to pass laws which as they should of course already do protect legality transparency and competition and prevent infringement procedures by the European Union begin to do so long before the text is drafted on which it was rightly hoped that if there should be a text it should be done quickly it would respect the law respond to the question and if it should make gifts do it to the people who need it and not to the billionaires who have very serious responsibilities on conscience as in the collapse of the Morandi bridge just as the judiciary has been ascertaining in recent months
Mr Urso FdI Mr President we have no doubts and no doubts as to where we are to stand Of course all the more so today when Sweden and Finland have ratified the Treaty of the Atlantic Alliance which ladies and gentlemen is not a formal fact but a historic event It is a historic event for three reasons indeed everything because the countries we welcome Sweden and Finland had made neutrality their raison d'être and now they have chosen were forced to choose It is a historic event for the moment when it occurs with a war on the borders of our Europe in which Italy like all Western and Atlantic democracies is committed to supporting Ukraine 's freedom its independence and its integrity It is a historic event because yes for once our country Italy and our Parliament have been united it is a virtually unanimous unity which I believe is due you must recognize it ladies and gentlemen the Italians recognize it to the precise determined coherent and responsible choice of Brothers of Italy who from the beginning encouraged Parliament to stand up for the attacker and against the aggressor If we had not made this choice of responsibility Italy would have once again appeared unreliable for your divisions and hesitations It is a historic turning point because Sweden and Finland are great democracies and with their accession it is strengthened and it is evident that at the basis of the Atlantic Alliance there are common values of freedom that today more than ever we must defend against the challenge launched by the totalitarian autocratic and imperial systems that want to subdue us as they are trying to subdue Ukraine and perhaps tomorrow Taipei This shows that the Atlantic Alliance has common values in the rule of law and in the democratic principles it expresses and protects in the emblematic value of freedom which if you will allow is the basis of well being I say this to some colleagues in the face of authoritarian systems that claim to be able to guarantee it better than us even in the absence of freedom Well being without freedom does n't interest us At the Madrid Summit as well as establishing membership of the Atlantic Alliance Russia was determined to be the most significant and direct threat and in these hours we must also realise what is happening in the Balkans Kosovo and Bosnia Herzegovina another of Putin 's objectives of expansionism as demonstrated by Lavrov 's failed journey At the same time it is important that this has happened while NATO redefines its objectives and Europe begins to come to an agreement on the need for a common defence which does not mean a common army but sharing security and defence with a scale of priority all the more important for what might still happen Sweden and Finland are great democracies but they are also countries that have developed an efficient military defense They will help us to protect the North Front where the threats to Kaliningrad then the Baltic States and the Arctic where Russia 's military expertise and supremacy in relation to the West will develop We will therefore be able to devote ourselves more to the South front where for the first time at the Madrid Summit the need for a centrality of the defence of the enlarged Mediterranean then of the Balkans the South Bank and Africa which must be our bet has been identified because that is where it develops and ends hopefully for us that is for the world of freedom and development the titanic confrontation between East and West 15:39 p.m. Follow Urso We Italians must be aware of this more than others in the protection of the enlarged Mediterranean in an Atlantic European policy towards Africa that is not only military but that it is above all a social economic and productive policy to grow and grow the continent with us Ladies and gentlemen other equally democratic countries I am referring to Germany and Japan today have already decided to change the Constitution in order to enable their peoples to defend themselves and to prepare a better defence We must reach as soon as possible the target of 2 of investment in the field of defence to make our contribution today more than ever decisive because it is in the enlarged Mediterranean that there is the greatest challenge between the West and the East not only towards Russia and Islamic fundamentalism but also China which in the enlarged Mediterranean finds its reasons for being and the natural outlet of its logic of economic and productive dominance through the Silk Road Ladies and gentlemen you are surprised that the right is on this position The right and those who know the history of the Republic know this has always been on the side of the Atlantic Alliance and has voted and helped to choose at the most decisive moments when Italy had to face the challenge This was also the case in 1983 when the Communist Party and the Italian left came to the streets against the installation of cruise and pershing missiles which were the decisive act in the cold war between the West and the East Then the Italian Social Movement voted for that decisive act and allowed Italy to be the first country to unlock the defense that is to install the cruise missiles to which the others would then follow while the Italian left was on another side on the other side of history which then turned out to be a loser You must not be surprised by our determination our coherence and our responsibility which led to the unity I would say almost unanimously of our Parliament even when we had to vote on sending weapons to Kiev Attention because it is not over here we all know that the months to come and the coming weeks will be decisive also with regard to the war conflict and we must be aware coherent and responsible at all times and support with determination and continuity the Ukrainian resistance in the face of the invader who uses every means of destruction more and more bloody We must give a signal of reliability We 'll do it by the majority of course If the citizens want to if the voters reserve us the leadership of the country we will be assured that Italy will keep its commitments because it is our national interest I hope that the opposition of the future will not change its position I hope that the political forces represented here will not change their position in changing the minds of the majority to the opposition I hope that you too will show the same coherence determination and responsibility as we have set an example in these months and years
"Mr President I have been speaking for the first time in this House since I was elected President of the Copasir using the time that my Group has given me to highlight first of all precisely what the Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic has done in recent months on the very issues that we will now have to deal with in a climate of emergency in the wake of the war in our Europe It will then be Senator La Russa in his explanation of vote who will explain the Group 's position Over the last few months we have been working intensively with our colleagues in the Copasir as required by the law under conditions of secrecy with investigations hearings and analyses which we have taken into account in specific reports to Parliament these yes in public In them we have highlighted among other things very clearly Russia 's aggressive posture not only in Ukraine and Eastern Europe but in every area of strategic Italian and European interest from the Balkans to the Caucasus from the Mediterranean to the Sahel according to a strategy aimed at maintaining energy supremacy controlling raw materials also in order to encircle our Europe We had also pointed out what was happening in Belarus with the constitutional referendum the new threats that arise in Bosnia and Kosovo the strengthening of the Russian military device in Syria the presence of Wagner 's mercenaries in Libya and the military coups six in the Sahel at the border of our enlarged Mediterranean which pave the way for Wagner Significant however only the joint naval maneuvers of Russia China and Iran held in January in the Gulf of Oman We had also made clear the need for a genuine European defence as the President in Office of the Council pointed out today complementary to NATO in order to increase the defence of the Atlantic Alliance on our continent and in the enlarged Mediterranean Soon we will deliver the report on space as a geopolitical factor on which Italy the sixth civil space power in the world can play an important role Defence and space will also be the subject of the decisions that Europe will have to take in March with the Strategic Compass and the project of strategic spatial autonomy now more than ever necessary However we have already pointed out in the recent annual report how completely inadequate the European defence project which in the state provides for a rapid intervention force of just 5,000 soldiers when Italy alone has a device of 9,200 soldiers on international missions The alleged commitments declared as a result of the wretched withdrawal from Afghanistan do not receive more resources Indeed in the new European budget the resources allocated to the various European defence projects have actually been halved Now it is clear to everyone that we need to change because Europe is under threat and we will know how to do it Precisely for this reason our first thought today goes to the Ukrainian resistance to the families in the shelters that on social networks ask for help to the girls who pack the Molotov bottles to the workers who dig the trenches to slow the advance of the tanks Our thoughts go to the young people who hold a rifle even though they have never done military service to those who return home to defend their families and their land to a heroic people who have finally discovered that they are a true nation without distinction of languages and religion as never before in their own tortured history They remind us today with the sacrifice of struggle what our values are awakening our numb consciences to them Putin made a gamble that got the effect of raising global public opinion united as never before Even within Russia itself there are protesters who risk imprisonment and repression This is the first important lesson a warning to anyone in the world who thinks that freedom also has a price that is measurable in rubles dollars or r enminbi a warning to anyone in the world who thinks that freedom can be removed without raising the unanimous reaction of those who like us believe and live in freedom The heroic resistance of the Ukrainians marks a first and an after in the global conflict between Western democracies and authoritarian systems a turning point that will be marked in the calendar of history What has happened to us must finally be a lesson to address issues that we have been putting aside for decades as if they were affecting others while they concern us and especially our children who will pay the price if we do not intervene immediately Investment in defence is certainly necessary as Germany has just done but also investment in research technology training the digital economy and artificial intelligence space and cyber energy sovereignty and the protection of strategic assets without which any autonomy and independence can be preserved The Copasir has presented six thematic reports and an annual report in this parliamentary term in which it has dealt with what is being discussed today Ladies and gentlemen none of these reports have yet been dealt with in a way that Parliament has done although some of the important speeches we have mentioned have been made by the golden power system at the National Cybersecurity Agency which fills a ten year delay The same fate in the void had the other reports presented in previous legislation as well as the annual reports of the Presidency of the Council We have been too distracted about the issues of national security we must now take note of them A session of Parliament must be held soon as we have specifically requested in our document sent to the Chambers before the situation falls What is happening makes us understand how important the security of the Republic is and how much this must be considered in every decision we take even when we address the issues of energy or the digital economy technology artificial intelligence space as well as steel infrastructure assets as industrial supply chains knowing that our systemic opponents i.e. authoritarian systems use them fully in their comparison with Western democracies All this is part of what is called a hybrid war In this regard we have highlighted the need to have economic intelligence at the service of the Italy system which is proactive in protecting the country 's science and technology and productive assets Yes it is true sanctions are producing their devastating effects but arms must also be stopped responding to the heartfelt requests for help from those threatened in life and affections as even countries that have always been historically neutral such as Switzerland and Sweden are doing Now is the time of the field choices for everyone Of course we will also pay the costs of sanctions especially as a result of the price of energy or if you will allow me ladies and gentlemen as a result of our wrong energy choices that have made us more vulnerable than other European partners It is precisely on energy security that we presented a report to Parliament in January in which we highlighted the criticalities of the system and its dangerous vulnerabilities in the face of both the necessary ecological transition and the hegemonic action of the state actors In that report we already identified some solutions that were the subject of the urgent decree in these hours and concluded that it was necessary to implement an energy security plan that would reduce dependence from abroad and above all from Russia with the objective of energy independence and productive and technological autonomy in collaboration with Western European partners also in view of the increasingly evident geopolitical factors and risks already at that time In the annual report for the security of the cyber network Yesterday however the Agency launched a particularly significant alarm also because Russia is the best equipped state in the world for cyber warfare To complete the defensive line we recalled the need to implement the national public administration cloud and the single public controlled network as soon as possible I 'm finishing Ladies and gentlemen Russia has long been preparing for confrontation with the West He 's been investing in the two weapons he owns for ten years energy resources and the armed forces It aims to control the raw materials and borders of Europe to subdue Ukraine today to subdue the Baltic Republics Georgia and Moldova tomorrow Now we all know why and we must raise the level of defence even in the face of a world in which other equally aggressive actors emerge first of all China the primary technological and productive power capable indeed of aspiring to global supremacy We can't escape history but we can change it With the unitary resolution that we will vote today a new phase in the political life of the country really begins that sees us always united when the security of the Republic is at stake and with it the fundamental values of our civilization"
Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister in the introduction you said in the end aware of the climate in this House that the agenda of this G7 so important and significant for the moment when it falls and for the city in which it takes place Berlin was a long agenda perhaps too long added boring given the climate of the House I could perhaps add terribly useless So a long agenda too long boring perhaps useless that does not take account of reality We who are a patriotic force of patriotic opposition must necessarily take account of reality and therefore the first thing we tell you about this agenda considering also the debate that took place a moment ago in the House and here in the Senate is that there seems to be Alice in the country of wonders I believe that you Minister have shown in recent months that you are not Alice in the country of wonders indeed you have shown that you speak frankly in Parliament and to the country already before the invasion of Russia in Ukraine when it was to be addressed as must be dealt with anyway and regardless the issue of energy security and its impact on the economy in the light of the ecological transition I would remind my fellow Senators that the Parliamentary Committee on the Security of the Republic forty days before the invasion of Russia in Ukraine has presented a report in Parliament and not by chance whose title is The report on energy security in the current phase of ecological transition because already before the invasion of Russia in Ukraine we of the Committee were aware and I believe that Parliament should be the same that the issue of energy security was already present or had to be present on our country 's agenda precisely in order to achieve the ecological transition objectives that we all share in Italy and in our European Union We hope that at the G7 summit you will make it clear that the fairy tale is over and that Germany and Europe must face reality first and foremost in the field of energy and the environment What does that mean ladies and gentlemen It means energy security and food security which is not obvious Just now there were those who pointed out how as a result of climate change there could be massive migratory movements of some ten million people from here to a few decades I think that this threat is much more imminent and does not concern future generations but our generation indeed the coming weeks and months If food security is not guaranteed for countries that live beyond the Mediterranean on the south bank in black Africa if Ukrainian ports are not liberated and those peoples are not allowed to supply grain and other food we will have that migratory mass that will come to press as a demographic bomb launched by those who have conceived a permanent war that is enucleated in a hybrid war of which energy is one of the elements of power and of which food is one of the other assets on which it can lever to press and subdue our Europe Of all this we find nothing on this agenda without realizing that if the G7 takes place in Berlin if it takes place a few months after the Russian invasion in Ukraine war still fought today it takes place with a stone feast which is Russia However we returned to the G7 I remind myself certainly not to our colleagues precisely because Russia had already invaded Ukraine in 2014 As a result of that invasion with the annexation of Crimea and militias disguised as independentists in the Donbass in Lugansk and Donetsk Russia was excluded from the G8 From 2014 to today too many years have passed without us noticing what the first war of invasion of Ukraine meant having then suffered the second more bloody than the first because at the first we could not react Above all it has not been able to react to Germany which today lists us as if nothing had changed the agenda of the next G7 energy and environment without mea culpa on the fact that on energy Germany has supported Russia 's power policy and has actually made us dependent to all intents and purposes Certainly we Italians have done the same as far as our responsibility is concerned We must therefore and I hope the Government will do so bring the situation back to reality even at that summit where we find ourselves It is no coincidence Minister that the President of the Draghi Council prefers to arrive at the extraordinary European Council without passing through the parliamentary classrooms as we the opposition force demand for clarity and transparency towards the country even though we support you must acknowledge this the unitary policy which we hope to be unanimous of our country in order to face the serious threat to Ukraine its freedom and independence and at the same time to some extent our freedom and independence It is no coincidence that he wants to go to the European Council without going to this House also because let us be clear it is precisely on energy that Europe is losing its unity Weeks ago we were told that the sixth package of sanctions against Russia was ready weeks have passed and this package of sanctions does not see the light precisely because it concerns energy in this case oil and then gas We were also told that the legal office would make payment in rubles impossible and then the opposite happened because the energy issue is the central theme of European submission to the policy of power of other nations and other countries and it is not only resolved in the field of good intentions or just keeping commitments We believe that commitments must be maintained in order to reach the end that energy transition and therefore ecological useful for the environment but recent events have shown that the other countries I speak of China India and not only have no interest in doing all this indeed they have taken advantage of the crisis to have other fossil energy at a better cost We know that we will not solve the problems of the Planet if we do not involve these countries but we must also know that alone we cannot take responsibility for the problems of the world without being aware of our priorities That is why I believe it is important Minister and I say this also in this House that the country clearly addresses the issue of energy security and food security not only for us but for others As far as energy security is concerned I believe that it is essential otherwise the commitments made also in the field of the environment will be essentially of façade and impossible to achieve We need a national energy security plan which will make the country understand the tools technologies and times to reach that national European and Western energy independence and independence without which we will not be able to defend our independence and therefore our sovereignty Starting with the conclusion this is also linked to the problem of technology because we run the risk of moving from a technology that makes us succubis of Russia that of coal to another technology on renewables that makes us succubis of China We would fall from the pan to the fire so it is more necessary than ever to achieve a strategic energy and production autonomy Italian and European
Mr Urso FdI Mr President this opportunity was also expressed by the Republic 's Parliamentary Security Committee in its annual report to Parliament presented on 9 February precisely because during the work carried out last year we had seen this interest in several hearings by those who are at the forefront of combating money laundering We speak specifically of the hearings held by the president of the Italian Banking Association Patuelli the general commander of the Zafarana Finance Guard and the offices in charge of the Bank of Italy That is why and we have taken this into account in Parliament we discussed it with the Franco Minister for Economic Affairs during his hearing We also count on this in the motion of Brothers of Italy aware like you of how important it is to make our country obtain the seat of the nascent European Authority and of how our country rightly has this ambition because it does not yet have an authority in the economic and financial field The economic and financial authorities are in Frankfurt Paris Madrid and outside the European Union Basel All the other major capitals of our European Union already have the seat of an economic and financial authority all except Italy On the merits it is clear to everyone that Italy and we say this each of us in the respective motions presented by the parliamentary groups has developed at the same time a particular legislation to combat money laundering which is also experienced in the field legislation that derives from the fact that our country first had to deal with the issue and did so thanks to the foresight of our hero judges Livatino Borsellino Falcone who indicated before others already at the end of the eighties how important it was to follow the trace of money to counter the money laundering of the great criminal organizations For this reason Italy has developed first and better than others legislation to combat this phenomenon which is then carried out in the field activities the phenomenon according to European data which would cover at least 1 of the gross domestic product of the European Union From this we must start to claim the seat and at the same time we must be aware that the issue today is even more important than in the past And it is for technological development which has allowed for the integration of financial flows It is because in the meantime this has also led through cybernetic activity linked to financial activity to the creation of virtual currencies and therefore also cryptocurrencies which are the instrument used by international groups criminals terrorists and not only And this has now highlighted the global nature of the criminal and terrorist groups we think of the extortion carried out also thanks to the cryptocurrencies we think and I conclude of how important the sanctioning regime in the tax field is that the systems the regimes or better still the rogue states try to circumvent through the cryptocurrencies or money laundering We are aware of how difficult the game is because now in the European negotiation a blocking union has emerged that makes it difficult to assert the right of our country to obtain the seat of that Authority in the substance But I think we owe it to heroic judges Paolo Borsellino and Falcone I hope that the seat of the Authority in whatever city in Italy is located will then have a street or a square where the Authority itself is located dedicated precisely to those who have taught us and Europe the road to pursue in order to fight through money laundering the major crimes organized at international level
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen I have spoken for the second time in this House since I was elected President of Copasir in June last year I did so only during the Government 's communications on the war in Ukraine to take into account the alarms expressed by the Committee in its reports on Russia 's aggressive posture in Ukraine and more generally in Europe and the enlarged Mediterranean in the Balkans Libya and the Sahel Africa an increased threat over time aimed at encircling Europe including through the control of energy and raw materials ready to use all means in a modern terrible and pervasive hybrid war We had highlighted the Russian military deployment around Ukraine as well as the consequences of the constitutional referendum in Belarus which would cancel the neutrality of that country thus allowing Russian troops to act even with nuclear devices from Belarus We had highlighted over time even in previous reports the action of Russian espionage and recruitment in our country the pervasiveness of Russian penetration in Europe aimed at conditioning democratic institutions the aggressive action carried out in the new war domains in space and in cyber and the systematic use of Wagner mercenaries not only in Africa We had written among other things and I quote a military escalation in Ukraine could lead to a further worsening of the situation which would also be ruinous especially for Italy which owes more than 40 of gas imports to Moscow We wrote it down Furthermore on energy security the Copasir produced a specific report to Parliament on 9 January of this year at the end of more than six months of study In that report we highlighted the need to free ourselves from foreign dependence all the more so from countries such as Russia which use energy as a power factor In that report we pointed out some solutions which are then the solutions that the government is now preparing to launch in the wake of the emergency Already then we talked about the need to double national gas production to diversify sources to use the state 's replacement power for the solar and wind power plants that were blocked We were already talking about the fourth generation of nuclear power and the hypothesis of nuclear fusion which President Draghi quoted a few days ago in the House of Deputies They were all indications already contained in our report on energy security Just as in the conclusion of the report we clearly indicated the absolute need to implement a national energy security plan in order to achieve strategic technological and productive autonomy in the Western European framework which we are finally talking about in the face of the emergency Ladies and gentlemen today we are finally discussing national security thoroughly on the basis of the Copasir 's annual report of 14 February This is important news Ladies and gentlemen as we said in the beginning of the report it has never happened in the past that an annual report by the Copasir or an annual report by the Presidency of the Council were examined in this House Law No 124 of 2007 fifteen years ago provides for these two reports which have never been examined in Parliament either in Parliament or in the Commission For this reason on behalf of the Committee I would like to thank the Presidency and the parliamentary groups for having shared the need as I hope every year for a specific parliamentary session This was what we asked for in the premise of our annual report a parliamentary session such as the one that takes place every year on justice with legislative consequences In recent years only one debate has taken place in this House on a subject for which Copasir was responsible in 2009 with then President Rotelli This was the case with the interceptions on which incidentally many years later on 21 October last year we were forced to make a report to Parliament ourselves In our report on the system of interceptions we denounced how a situation of absolute discretion on the modalities and criteria by which mandates are entrusted to carry out judicial interceptions also concerning the conservation or destruction of the same I would remind everyone that we are under European infringement procedure because the prosecutors do not intend to implement what is laid down in a specific European directive and what is laid down in Italian law We are waiting for the Minister of Justice to keep what he promised to do during the hearing In other cases however our reports have been followed by concrete actions I am referring for example to cybersecurity which was the subject of our first report to Parliament at the beginning of the parliamentary term It has led to the extension of golden power to the telecommunications sector to the realization of the national perimeter on cybersecurity to the birth albeit only last June with more than ten years of delay of the Agency for national cybersecurity On the other hand we have not been followed up by our request at the time to identify a crime that would allow the perpetrators of the attacks to be prosecuted properly and to prepare an active defence which will obviously be discussed in the next few days In this report we also highlight the need to implement as soon as possible the national cloud of public administration the single public controlled network a strategic policy for maritime connection European technological and productive autonomy in the digital economy Unfortunately ladies and gentlemen there has not been enough attention even when we noticed that Russia is the most equipped state in the cybernetic war and today we have to think about how to eliminate the criticalities that may arise from the fact that Russian antivirus software is used as Trojan horses In these hours the Government of course also at our request will take other necessary measures of which we have been properly informed as always happens in a full and loyal confrontation between the institutional bodies The same is true even more so of Chinese technology which is far more pervasive as we have shown three years ago and reiterated in this report and which unfortunately is not successful calls for the use of Chinese technology in the telecommunications system to be inhibited Other indications of the Committee have been incorporated and taken into account in this report for example with the extension of golden power to the financial and banking sector and other important strategic assets of the country including the health chain or with the criminal law that punishes the detention of material for terrorist purposes I am also thinking of the indication contained in our report on how to combat Islamic radicalisation and the new forms of jihadist terrorism which we presented following the fall of Kabul into the Taliban regime This indication has recently been transposed by the House 's Committee on Constitutional Affairs and therefore we have taken a step forward Surely there is much more to be done In our annual report we have highlighted some strategic assets of the country that we have dealt with in our annual activity from research to university to the protection of patents of technology from the digital economy to port infrastructures from the steel industry to the automotive one from semiconductors to batteries from hydrogen to the recycling of precious minerals from the new dual competition on space to the defence industry On space as a geopolitical factor today we are talking about interspace war and on European defence we are about to conclude after months of investigation two specific reports that we will present to you in the next few days investigations that we have not by chance activated after the wretched withdrawal from Afghanistan In the annual report however we have already pointed out a number of observations on European defence Specifically we have anticipated that it already seemed insufficient to us well before the Russian invasion in Ukraine a forecast of just 5,000 soldiers as a European rapid force in view of the fact that only Italy employs 9,200 soldiers on international missions In this report too we have told you how inadequate the resources provided for in the European Union 's multiannual financial framework have appeared to us resources that have been halved compared to the previous budget Now of course everything will change under the pressure of war as Germany has done and if Germany has you understand that we have to do so too But let us ask ourselves whether the Russian threat is not also the result of European distraction of our unwillingness to see what was happening We can't do this anymore Let 's have it This is also why a broad chapter of the report concerns economic intelligence all the more important in the face of the hybrid war that has been going on for years not since today and of which the main issue is our enlarged Mediterranean It is a hybrid war in which authoritarian systems China and Russia in the lead but not only aspire to technological and economic supremacy also through the control of the energy and food resources of the planet from gas to water of raw materials precious minerals and rare earths of everything that serves the digital and ecological economy we must absolutely realize it but it is falling under their control Who has not noticed we have noticed that in recent months six military coups have taken place of which five have succeeded in four countries of the Sahel in two of which obviously have called the mercenaries of Wagner Economic intelligence and cyber intelligence bond with each other To put it to your attention we have conducted a confrontation with some Western democracies with our Western democracies the United States France Japan and Sweden who have long developed economic intelligence to understand what can be done more and better in democratic countries to protect our technology and our businesses our science and creativity our society and therefore our freedoms Something has been done with current legislation at our request fully shared by the Government and we also acknowledge this to the Undersecretary Gabrielli as we did in our report But even more needs to be done with specific legislative changes because what has been done so far is in existing legislation It is Parliament 's job to change the law In this context we have pointed out that the golden power instrument is useful necessary but not sufficient We also need an industrial policy that aims to preserve and if possible strengthen the country 's strategic assets The same tool as the golden power greatly strengthened in recent years is still little used Look at the reports to Parliament on golden power We say that because sometimes Parliament is distracted The golden power instrument itself which has been considerably strengthened over the past few years at the Committee 's own initiative needs to be further adapted to the evidence that it has been put into practice The case of Alpi Aviation a small company with a high technological content which we have examined and which we take into account in our report on which the Government has recently intervened blocking the sale to a Chinese state owned company has determined us to ask that the golden power instrument also include preventive monitoring action in order to protect small and medium sized enterprises with high technological content as happens in other countries such as the United States This is in our relationship Our report always has a precise method of empirical work it starts from a specific case such as the one mentioned above and takes into account our requests to the Government to act within the limits of existing legislation This is the case during hearings see the number of hearings held last year especially in the second part of the year or through specific information notes to the competent authorities read the specific information notes we sent and to whom we sent them Finally through the reports to Parliament we urge the legislator to intervene For example in the field of monitoring the work of the intelligence sector on which there is a whole chapter and which is the Committee 's main task we found the Marco Polo Council case Our activity in this regard has allowed the authority of the sector to prepare a first measure on the incompatibility of the summits of the Intelligence after the cessation of the service A measure published on an extraordinary basis in the Official Journal so that third parties may be aware of it Now we need to improve the legislative framework which is Parliament 's job As well as I hope I hope other bodies of the State will also do as far as they are competent In the final part of the report we therefore provide some guidance on what we consider necessary to amend in Law 124 An excellent law but passed in 2007 fifteen years ago when the hybrid war was not even imaginable when Russia was basically still in the spirit of Sea Practice In the report we say that it is already necessary to do so called ordinary maintenance but absolutely necessary and we also list the points where action is needed At the same time however we have pointed out that legislation needs to be revised more significantly also with regard to the architecture and expertise of intelligence agencies For this reason we have announced that in the next and final report at the end of the legislature at the end of further investigation we will provide our relevant information in a preventive comparison to the Copasir with the Government Among other things we have dealt with one issue which emerged in both this parliamentary term and the previous one concerning the composition of the Committee at the time when the majority opposition parliamentary position changed In the previous parliamentary term he had been pleaded with a transitional legend increasing the number of members of the Committee have we forgotten that We have not forgotten that We have therefore proposed in this report a regulatory solution allowing the Presidents of the Chambers to intervene when the majority opposition distribution changes to regulate the Committee 's activities which in fact in the first six months of last year see the number of hearings and speeches had practically reduced to a small number almost paralyzing itself compared to what we did in the second part of the year The work of the Parliamentary Committee on the Security of the Republic cannot be paralyzed it cannot of course be done today Ladies and gentlemen reading the combined provisions of the annual report and the report on energy security someone wrote that the Copasir had foreseen what would happen some journalists have been psyched on this with military aggression in Ukraine Something significant we had said in the ways in which we could say it of course on the basis of the secret hearings that we had held and therefore the information that we ourselves received because our source of information is the hearings the Intelligence the Government the authorities that we summon nothing else to avoid misunderstandings Now we must react aware that we are at a turning point in history to an epochal passage The world we dreamed of is gone and maybe there was n't even yesterday there is a before and after and it does n't help to recriminate or reproach or worse still put in trouble the opponent or ally for what he had declared in other times in another historical age when he had other information This is a game of massacre that the country does n't need It is the moment of unity and responsibility as they have been realized unity and responsibility in the resolution that defines what Italy 's position on the war in Ukraine should be a war that concerns us because it is a part of the hybrid war that with different but equally devastating means authoritarian systems have developed towards Western democracies to subdue us and if you like even to some extent to take away our freedoms It is also a problem for the West Let me give you an example that must be clear to everyone because technology develops and today technology allows algorithms through facial recognition and only through that to understand what are the political opinions of the citizen who is subjected to facial recognition without other information You understand well what this means compared to countries where social control of dissent is prevalent and in countries such as ours where the privacy and freedoms of individuals communities and nations are fundamental That is why I hope that the same unity and responsibility will be realized whenever we address the issues of the security of the Republic which is not only control over intelligence I say this in the absence of misunderstandings The parliamentary committee for the security of the Republic already in its name which Parliament chose in 2007 unlike the previous Copaco is not limited to the control of intelligence it also does that of course and it is not limited to the apparatuses of the State either because we are not talking about state security The name refers to the security of the Republic which is something more and different the legislator has been far sighted than the control of intelligence or even simply the control of state security That is why we have dealt with thematic reports we have done six in this parliamentary term of which three in the last six months The arguments seem irrelevant to those who do not look from the perspective of national security but today we know how important the report we have made on financial security and the insurance system of our country in the face of the decisions that for example Europe and the Western world have had to take on financial sanctions against Russia In the same way we realize how important the cyber security report of three years ago was regarding the possibility of a cybernetic attack in our country and the measures that must be taken to prevent that through the Trojan horse of technology we can expropriate our information or worse still trigger a cybernetic war in our country I hope therefore that the same unity and responsibility will be fulfilled whenever we speak of security to the Republic and that at last every year there will be a report with a meeting with final resolutions in which the report of the Presidency of the Council which is held every year in February and the annual report of the Copasir will be examined and compared so that Parliament and the country can be aware of how the needs of the Republic 's security change with respect of course to what happens in every international context I believe that this is useful for Parliament to come up with the necessary measures I believe that in this case we could really say that we have responded to the needs of the country I conclude ladies and gentlemen by saying that we must realise that we cannot escape history even if we may wish to We cannot escape from history and history today requires us to take the necessary measures immediately as regards our defence our security and the strategic assets of our country to face together with the other Western democracies in our European Union and in our Atlantic Alliance what we have before us We cannot escape history but we can change history"
Mr President first of all I would like to thank the Members who have thought that they have spoken here for the ideas they have given us on which we will then make our subsequent reflections in the context of the meetings that the Committee will develop Of course I would like to thank my colleagues from the Committee who have spoken Senators Arrigoni Castiello and Magorno because as they have pointed out the Committee acts as it must as a team and not by chance all the reports it has submitted under the three Presidencies of this legislature have been unanimously approved This shows that there has been a sharing beyond belongings and the placement between majority and opposition Of course I also thank the intelligence men who are often engaged in crisis theatres In a few days as every year there will be a ceremony at the intelligence headquarters in memory of their fallen men to protect the nation during their missions I would like to respond specifically to some of my colleagues on the issues that have been highlighted The Copasir hearing was held today on energy by Mr Cingolani who will be speaking here tomorrow morning To answer Senator D'Arienzo I will give an emblematic figure twenty years ago we imported 20 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia today we import 29 30 billion that is 10 billion more that are exactly what we produce less from our deposits because twenty years ago we produced 15 billion cubic meters of gas in Italy and imported 20 billion from Russia today we produce in Italy 3 4 billion and we import 10 more from Russia To my friend and colleague Senator Gasparri who stresses the risk of other supplies I say that it is true if as we will do we will diversify our sources to provide more from Africa not only Algeria Libya or Egypt but also from Congo and Angola then we will have to understand that Africa is in our main interests because if we abandon it then it is worse than turning or abandoning Russian gas We must therefore make a strategic policy for Africa I would point out to Senator Gallone who highlighted our speech on hydropower that Parliament will decide next week whether our assessments of national interest should also lead to the modification or suspension of competitions which we alone do in the European context Senator Malan and Senator Pinotti rightly talk about the Cybersecurity Agency which is important I also believe that it is significant what the Government intends to prepare shortly to eliminate some critical conditions compared to Russian Kaspersky software and not only Senator Pinotti rightly proposes to hold a parliamentary session on European defence and defence in general I believe that this is very important also the light of what Mr Arrigoni pointed out about the Italian defence industry which must have its own policy We have in fact assisted and we have evidenced to the fact that a very important company like Leonardo anticipates a defense industry policy and another just as important as Fincantieri anticipates a different one There is therefore a need all the more so in this area for a national defence industry policy To Senator D'Arienzo who addresses the topic of economic intelligence linking it also to the European one I respond that on the economic front you cannot develop a European intelligence because it is clear to everyone that the interests and the modalities of intervention are different just think of France which is one of the most active subjects on economic intelligence On the other hand cooperation on military intelligence and even more significant integration can and must be developed In this regard only in parenthesis I would point out to this House how important the evolution of Atlantic intelligence is I am referring specifically to the possibility of enlargement of five eyes the five eyes that share information among them that we ourselves cannot share It has emerged quite clearly in this Russian war in Ukraine how much the American Intelligence and English Intelligence evidently share with each other and with the other three countries of the so called five eyed information that is not necessarily shared with us There is an important problem that we have to deal with from this point of view I shall conclude on the subject of desegregation put by President Marilotti whom I thank for what he has done and is doing We will deliver to this Parliament a report not on the Moro praise Mr Gasparri although perhaps it would be necessary but on how to improve the regulations in order to make the best conservation of acts It is undoubtedly true what Senator Marilotti had denounced a few days ago with the current legislation or better with its current execution it would take two hundred and thirty years only to desegretate the acts contained here in the Senate of the Republic Finally I respond to secret contracts about which Senators Magorno and Gasparri spoke the legislation concerns secret contracts which according to European standards should also include contracts for the custody of interceptions by the judiciary Instead the judiciary believes that unlike other European countries we are a special case and secret contracts are not handed over to the Authority that the Government and Parliament have identified for control which is the Special Section of the Court of Auditors I would add that in recent days the Court of Auditors has also given us further documentation on the possibility that failure to implement the European directive and failure to deliver secreted contracts to the special office of the Court of Auditors may also interfere with the validity of the ongoing proceedings And here I conclude so as not to open up other very important issues
IWOBI L SP PSd Az Madam President members of the Government ladies and gentlemen today we are called upon to express ourselves on this important draft ratification law concerning the accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the Atlantic Alliance It is certainly a significant step given the long tradition of non-alignment that these two countries had in the post war period a strategic approach that of non-alignment which allowed Sweden and Finland to remain close to the West but to maintain a good relationship with the cumbersome Soviet neighbour The historic decision of the two countries to stop this strategic approach to officially join NATO is clearly a direct consequence of the Russian aggression in Ukraine last February which has followed several assertive Moscow policies over the years This does not mean that the choice of Sweden and Finland is due solely to quota factors Both countries have started a process of modernisation and transformation of their security and defence policies which has made military cooperation with the Atlantic Alliance increasingly frequent and which makes their entry an added value for the Atlantic bloc A small strategic reflection on NATO 's enlargement to these two countries We are talking about a new enlargement director towards the North who clearly brings new opportunities and new challenges Expanding the perimeter of security entails unprecedented burdens and responsibilities for NATO Competition on the Arctic at the moment marginal in the interests of the Atlantic Alliance can regain a new weight as a result of this accession process The Russian invasion in Ukraine has given great prominence to the East European front which has returned to the centre of NATO 's interests The aggressive policies of China which is considered the real challenger of the international order by the countries of the Alliance will force things to concentrate efforts and burdens on the Asia Pacific quadrant These are challenges that as NATO 's founding country we need to know and support It is good to remember however that our strategic interests are mostly located in the so called South front in the enlarged Mediterranean basin Asymmetric threats such as terrorism political instability leading to crises and mass migration the energy supply match these elements are priorities for our foreign policy and must be our objective to bring back the focus of the Atlantic Alliance also towards the South front In conclusion Sweden and Finland have realised that there is no security outside a cohesive political military organization like NATO and have knocked on our door It 's our duty Open it to him As our secretary Matteo Salvini stated Italy 's membership of the Atlantic Alliance is not in question and it is not a political crisis or a change of government that can question this reality We belong proudly to the history and culture of the West we can only be on the side of the free countries and we work to ensure that the future is a future of peace For these reasons I declare the vote in favour of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione
IWOBI L SP PSd Az Mr President I am voting in favour of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group
Mr President Mr President in Office of the Council members of the Government ladies and gentlemen Russia 's military operation today leads us more than ever to question ourselves as a people as a nation and as a European Union about the importance of the value of peace Speaking of peace today as the primary and decisive objective of the Russian Ukrainian conflict is fortunately a wish shared by all of us The question is if anything how to reach it It is clear that today more than ever there is a sense of the importance of a common European foreign and defence policy which actually leads the Union to gain greater international weight and full strategic autonomy in all fora Unfortunately the sinking of the Minsk Accords and the worsening of the current situation lead us to hope for a more central and incisive role of the European Union than today above all as a promoter of the values of peace even beyond its borders The reasons behind this conflict are multiple and the symptoms could be analysed for a long time but beyond every single reason what is certain is the unacceptable military aggression to a democracy at the gates of Europe thus opening up a wound and a new drama within a continent that in the past decades has already suffered for a long time because of wars The main points to consider are to avoid the immediate extension of this conflict to reach the conclusion of military actions as soon as possible by using diplomacy as the only possible means of resolving disputes If this is a shared goal it is equally important to conceive ways of achieving this result It is clear that a cross-cutting sanctioning action where not well thought out can also have serious consequences of an economic industrial energy and therefore social nature in European countries and especially in our country The sanctions mechanism must therefore be considered as a strategic deterrent which in order to be such must minimise the consequences on the economies of the Member States of the European Union and at the same time to ensure the effectiveness of its scope Some consequences will certainly be inevitable even in the light of the effects that we are still experiencing in connection with the pandemic crisis However we trust in the wise decision of the Italian Government to ensure that Italy 's position in the possible adoption of sanctions against Russia is taken into account in the appropriate forums At this very difficult stage it is called upon to take decisions that require a collective and supranational conscience for the security of all its citizens and for the objective of peace With the hope that the conflict will cease as soon as possible an important test for the European Union will be the joint management of the reception of Ukrainian refugees I am sure that Italy will be at the forefront of reaffirming the values of European solidarity guaranteeing shared humanitarian corridors I shall conclude Mr President by expressing our full solidarity with the Ukrainian people and reaffirming the great sense of responsibility which must animate this like any other Parliament both to resolve the current situation and above all to avoid a dangerous military escalation with devastating and unpredictable effects on both sides We express our full trust in the Italian Government and in diplomacy
Mr President ladies and gentlemen the Conference on the future of Europe has been a time for debate that has been desired and requested for several years to bring proposals from below with a view to improving and modifying the functioning of Europe which has not been reflected for a number of reasons Surely the pandemic has further removed the possibilities of encounters of carrying out physical events and has helped to divert the tension of the path of the Conference However it is certain that the poor result achieved reflects a perception of the distance of European citizens towards the European institutions sometimes seen more as a castle of bureaucrats than as representatives of the people at the service of all European citizens I will concentrate briefly on three issues European democracy foreign policy and defence work First of all it is clear that the intergovernmental mechanism of the European institution still clearly prevails over the supranational identity of the European Union The common perception is that since the last amendment of the Treaties more steps have been taken back than steps forward That is why as a parliamentary group we have often stressed the importance of structural reforms in the Union in the various documents we have produced over the last few years It is necessary to find the courage to sit at the table and amend the Treaties in order to arrive at a European Union that will defeat its democratic deficit and address those socio- economic issues which if unresolved will continue to remain a factor of political division That is also why we have called for and continue to call for a greater role for the European Parliament the only true representative body since it is directly elected by the citizens It is unacceptable that the European Parliament should not have the power of legislative initiative but only the power of proposal The high rate of abstention during the European elections is a warning bell that has been ringing for decades and has not yet found sufficient answers from the European institutions The European Union must be the cradle of popular participation and not an institution that further alienates citizens from politics We also need to rethink the role of the European Commission the true decision making body of the future of the Union moving towards a path that changes the elections of the President of the Commission and truly makes the Commission accountable to the European Parliament it is essential in order to improve the functioning of the Union to bring it closer to the citizens The same applies to the transparency and publicity of the work of certain European interministerial meetings such as the Ecofin We have often talked about this in this House and as a group we have raised the problem of the famous secrecy constraints that accompany certain fundamental economic and monetary decisions These are elements that do not contribute to the democratization of the Union and we are sure that the founding fathers of the European project would not have been thrilled to know how much the current bureaucratic apparatus of the Union is so different from the original dream With regard to the external dimension of the European Union which has often been discussed in the Foreign Commission there are clear fears from the ideas and ideas emerging from the Conference about the lack of geopolitical role of the European Union Europe is unable to carry out any deterrent and mediation activity in relation to global issues whether they be economic or security issues And this is the case despite the fact that the European continent continues to be one of the world 's major economies and demographys The reasons for this lack are different and would require a long and in depth debate from slow decisions of vital importance to different geopolitical views and interests between Member States through a lack of strategic coherence that prevents Europe from feeling like a global actor We have often seen the European Union trying to punish or threaten its own Member States in legal terms let us think about the case of Hungary and Poland and forgetting the serious security dangers that face our continent As far as relations with the outside world are concerned the work of the Conference reveals the desire to establish greater cooperation and dialogue with African counterparts I personally welcome this will with great pleasure Over the course of these years we have worked hard on every measure to bring the issues to light on all we have highlighted the importance of a structural project such as the one relating to the fight against the drying up of Lake Chad a water basin that supports the economy of the whole Sahel Investing as a European Union in such a project literally means saving the future of tens of millions of people and allowing them to live in their own country Africa is a demographically young continent facing structural problems that limit its economic development The decision to cooperate with the African continent as the European Union is crucial in many respects It means giving the future to millions of people who want to live in their country to contribute to their growth It means preventing land depopulation stopping the bleeding of human beings that is a disaster for Africa 's future It means dealing with immigration a priori not only by preventing the departure by coercive methods but also by offering prospects for development It means countering the great interference of one of the present global and territorial powers on the Continent with all the strategic dangers arising from the excessive penetration of this power into our southern borders Finally it means dealing with security a stronger Africa is a deterrent to the development of jihadist terrorism which feeds on poverty and illusions There Italy must play a primary role and remind European partners of the importance of the southern borders and the relationship with the African continent and build a leadership within the European Union based on our diplomatic network that the whole world envies us Finally a brief mention is made of the issue of labour on which I believe it is necessary to achieve an overall strategy in Europe which can balance the protection of workers with the needs of the labour market and economic development For this reason it will be essential to start a path to significantly reduce the tax dumping of our country and of the member countries to counter relocation focused on labour costs alone to stimulate the research and development of the enterprises to generate employment and to raise the level of competitiveness of the Union compared to global competitors In conclusion Mr President I expect the final act of the Conference to be a starting point for reaching an act of courage from the Member States and the European institutions for a response that can fill the immobilisation that has occurred in Europe in recent years and that perhaps before the pandemic and now the war is awakening PRESIDENT The debate is closed He 's enlisted to speak Senator Airola You have the right to do so

"RAUTI FdI IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government we welcome the fact that the measure has been scheduled today in this House I mention only the short title to revise the model of Armed Forces to delegate to the Government for the revision of the national military instrument We welcome today 's debate and we hope for the adoption of the measure Above all before this I would like to express my satisfaction with the work carried out in the Chamber before the Senate in the Commission defended by the Brothers of Italy Group which has already worked since the beginning of this legislature for an amendment of Law n. 244 of 2012 Our Group has worked across the board with the other political groups to arrive at a single text and the proposed amending law that we are discussing today So there has been and I stress this a constructive climate in the Commissions both in the House and in the Senate around this important fundamental provision I would say that it was neither easy nor difficult I would say that it was necessary and useful For who and for what Evidently for a common goal the well being of the military of our Armed Forces a greater functionality of them and I would say a greater dignity and recognition of the value of the commitment of our Armed Forces It is clear I have no difficulty in saying this that each of us has given up something we ourselves have withdrawn a number of amendments and we have done so because we could not miss the opportunity to have the reform approved by the end of the parliamentary term As far as the programme is concerned we have also signed the agenda for the first time by Mr Gasparri who is a bit of a shared agenda which was then signed by all the parliamentary groups This is because it is a fundamental reform that must affect as already mentioned Law 244 of 2012 which provided for a reduction of staff to create a professional model that in principle is of course acceptable but then there is reality there are the effects of application there is life in barracks Whoever visited us or who like me has also served us knows what life is in barracks that is the daily life of those who wear a uniform It is evident to all those who have been interested in it that the negative effects of Law No 244 were already seen they were seen in the meantime in a saving that has not been but above all in the ageing of the staff and in an operation limited by the constraints that it was pushing against an increasing capacity specialization and formation of our armed forces operating both in the homeland and abroad On this I open a small parenthesis because also at international level colleagues where we gain attention and appreciation of everyone for how we work in our peace missions and in international civil and military cooperation missions only in the current year we have 44 international missions and 7.598 committed units So how do we how do we think we can achieve a cutting of staff even if it is progressive in the face of growing needs in the face of growing international commitments in the face of emergencies It is not possible to remove resources and reduce staff I think that no sector could ever bear a reduction of 40,000 people in fact it was expected to increase from 190,000 to 150,000 people in addition to the cutting of civilians I repeat no sector could bear a staff cut of 40,000 units at the same time responding to every need every service every growing emergency I stress up to the pandemic from Covid The ageing of staff and the shortage of staff call for action Attention ladies and gentlemen we are now removing a noose from the necks of our armed forces because that is what I call Law 244 It is clear however that this is only a step and a starting point We must continue to deal with the armed forces we must continue to take seriously the issues of defence and security which are crucial and central to geopolitics and national interests My colleague Mr Urso in his previous explanation of vote also stressed and articulated what it means today to be committed to international security and international peace It is not only a question of deterrence but also an important one it is a strategic and military policy it is stability to be guaranteed at international level while the threat to collective security is spreading and traditional threats are added to those of the hybrid war To the classic domains of land air and sea are added the new brand new ones of cyber of space of the technological challenge It really is a universe to be faced with for which we must be equipped As my colleague Mr Urso reminded me I say this to those who have had some second thoughts I do not want to make controversy today but memory is memory we must respect the international commitments made and allocate 2 of GDP to military defence expenditure When we remembered it we created a backlash in the outgoing majority But we must be consistent we cannot think of cutting resources or not achieving goals and then demanding the maximum from our Armed Forces Let 's get back to the topic Our armed forces are heritage institution symbol value and operational reality at home and internationally guaranteeing peace and security Why is this reform important I just want to point out a ride This reform says enough to the military precariousness It introduces the system of the stop of the volunteers in fixed stop during the first service of three years you will be able to access with a contest to the next fixed stop of three years with a transit in permanent service This means finally declaring war on the precarious it means improving the conditions of economic treatment and the legal status of the person who dresses the uniform Enough with the insecurity in the Armed Forces When the precarious becomes stable and becomes indefinitely it means that something has not gone and is not going I 'm gonna finish Today Parliament is reappropriating its role and function I mean because it is important We have also reached this agreement for a superior and common objective in the name of the military forces of the armed forces of the country We have done this for a higher objective for a higher common interest and for a national interest that we call homeland"
RAUTI FdI Mr President the world has changed since 24 February Russia 's military aggression against Ukraine has broken a global geopolitical order and has also brought into crisis a security paradigm for the entire West It is a war in Europe and European countries strengthen their defence and security structures welcome some countries more than others Ukrainian refugees and send aid and weapons systems In the face of the Ukrainian crisis Europe was forced to cope with the prolonged absence of a foreign policy the weakness of its diplomacy and the lack of a common defence force Italian diplomacy did not play a leading role in the scenario of tension and crisis that preluded the outbreak of war We were let 's say quite absent and silent but also a little marginalized in those international attempts then failed to find a diplomatic solution After the outbreak of the war the Italian Government committed itself to an important resolution supported also by Brothers of Italy which condemns the aggression of Russia shares the European decision on sanctions against Russia and establishes the right of reception for Ukrainian refugees Again the first Ukrainian decree we know that there will be others is approved in the House I would say almost unanimously however with a very large majority with the favorable vote of Brothers of Italy a favorable vote be it clear not to the Government but to the contents of the decree a vote ours which expresses the condemnation of the Russian military attack on Ukraine and its people attack on national sovereignty freedom independence and the right of those people to self determination Our position was clear from the beginning and we have never changed it an inevitable inexorable choice of field on the one hand tanks and on the other the civilian population on the one hand the aggressor and on the other the attacker And while always trusting in diplomacy negotiations and the resolution of conflicts with international law there are moments like this where there is no room for hesitation for sophisticated distinctions and for a sort of hairy pacifism We will never do the eulogy of war we are terrified of it like everyone else and we are horrified of it but we do not even accept I want to be clear those who claim the surrender of the Ukrainians as a duty Only the Ukrainian people can claim the right to surrender just as they can be the only one to exercise their right to defend themselves and defend their national sovereignty We believe that the aggressor must rely on solidarity and support from Western democracies I return to the decree law approved also with the vote of Brothers of Italy to the House it is a consensus dictated by the Ukrainian crisis and the emergency in which we crashed It is a decree law that provides I remind those who pretend to forget it today also military aid and the participation of military personnel in the upgrading of existing NATO devices such as for example the deployment of Alliance forces in the Baltic Republics the surveillance of the Alliance 's airspace the naval surveillance device and more As we have denounced both the House and the Senate in the Commission trying to amend without success the text in this sense in this decree law there is no intervention to protect Italian families and businesses from expensive bills There is no intervention which is also present in all our amendments on which the Budget Committee has expressed a contrary opinion in order to support businesses and households against expensive bills You also rejected the amendment on unaccompanied minors So we ask ourselves a lot of questions You did not want to face the damage caused by the economic rebound of sanctions which falls on Italy on our trade and on our companies Thus while Germany decides to raise its military expenditure to the threshold of 2 of annual GDP and even to create a special fund of EUR 100 billion dedicated to arms and while France chooses to increase its investment in security and defence in Italy President Draghi to be exact at the Versailles European Council reaffirms the respect for commitments not binding but still signed with allies already in 2006 I remember and relaunched at the Summit in Wales in 2014 i.e. those of 2 of GDP for defence expenditure The government therefore reiterates old commitments and assumes new ones it does so in the House on 16 March also approving an agenda linked to the decree law on Ukraine which commits it to progressively increase the expenses of the defence towards the goal precisely of 2 of GDP Let us make it clear that we in 2020 were in the world ranking in 102nd place and therefore perhaps we should do something The government assumes a precise posture There are I have here dozens of statements which I could of course re-emphasise about the positions taken by the President in Office of the Council and the Minister of Defence but in a few days at some point everything changes and we are today The Italian government is screwed on itself it takes two steps forward and one back it swings it crawls We are here without a rapporteur and paradoxically with the request for a vote of confidence with which basically let 's say more than ever the Government disowns itself I would like to remind you that our agenda for those who had not read it and had only told it did not indicate a time period in the commitments in which there is no 2024 written and this is of its importance In addition it was asked to be consistent with what has already been said So I come to the conclusion Those resources are needed for barracks equipment training air bases hangars everything that needs to be renovated in defense they are needed for cyber challenges That 's what the expense increases are for Dear colleagues of the League I also address you Our choice today not to vote for trust in the Ukraine decree is easy because you do not deserve our trust Our choice is a must it is called consistency We would also have voted in the Senate as in the House in favour of this bill of conversion of the decree law if it had had a normal path with amendments agendas improvements or a comparison On the contrary the recourse to yet another vote of confidence on such a shared and sensitive matter denies the Government itself that that confidence demands Yesterday President Ciriani and Vice President La Russa stated the contradictions contained in the request for a vote of confidence Our choice is compulsory and easy What I ask myself and ask you is your choice It is more difficult for you or at least it should be because I wonder what vote of confidence you are expressing For which government do you vote for trust you who are such diverse forces Which Government are you trusting To the Government that accepted without rewording it the incriminating agenda of Brothers of Italy and yet it is history Or to the government of Minister Di Maio who has not spoken and we do not know what you think Or to the government of Minister Guerini who sought a loophole with mathematics predicting the end of 2028 sure comes after 2024 for goodness sake What is the government you trust Is it the Count Government which increased military spending by 17 during your term of office What is the government you trust What says one thing and you deny the next day What is your government President Draghi has said well to you saying I shall conclude Madam President that if the commitments made at such a delicate time are called into question at the gates of Europe the majority pact will fail You must take note of this Yours is not a force of government it is a summation that is not a synthesis that does not have a foreign policy and that is full of contradictions Take note of this and its consequences
RAUTI FdI I would like to briefly explain our abstention vote in relation to the timetable that we are about to vote on I recall that last week Brothers of Italy during the joint hearing at the Defense Commissions of the Chamber and Senate in the presence of Minister Guerini had already asked for an information from President Draghi We have done so because the full mandate that Parliament has given I am referring to the decree laws of Ukraine one and two also provided for a continuous and constant updating of Parliament So by virtue of this we were among the first to ask for information Subsequently the President as has been mentioned by his colleagues indicated the date of 19 for a question time and in the meantime important meetings are taking place concerning the visit of President Draghi and his meeting with President Biden I would therefore like to give our reasons for abstaining on the request to amend the timetable put forward by Mr Crucioli who is about to be put to the vote This request for a hearing of Ministers is somehow understood and surpassed by the question time already scheduled so I am making it a matter of method and not of merit of course However I would also like to say that we hope that the Brothers of Italy just proposed in the Conference of the Leaders will be welcomed that is that the question time already scheduled can be transformed into an information because this would allow us to have longer times of confrontation on a topic that surely represents the emergency among emergencies With regard to this we are abstaining also on the basis of what was requested at the Conference of the Leaders and we are clearly waiting for a response from Prime Minister Draghi
Mr President the Conference on the future of Europe was proposed in 2019 and should have started work on 9 May 2020 but due to the pandemic it was postponed until 9 May 2021 His work lasted a year and should be concluded on 9 May next on the 72nd anniversary of the Schuman Declaration the declaration by the then French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman who proposed on 9 May 1950 the creation of a European Coal and Steel Community whose members would have combined coal and steel production I remember this because today this anniversary has a certain effect if we contextualize it and if we think about the crucial and emerging issue that Europe is Italy are facing that is the energy supply the exit from dependence on Russian gas and oil and that of founding the premises for a necessary autonomy for an ecological transition as well as for the use of renewable energies Let us return to the Conference which should have relaunched the European project involving European citizens and civil society and which as Mr Malan recalled is organised by the three main European institutions the Commission Parliament and the Council and is coordinated by an Executive Committee In short the intention would be as we read in the documents relating to the Conference that I went to see a unique opportunity to reason on the challenges and priorities of Europe as we always read on the site through a mechanism of plenarys and working groups I also went to check the number of meetings There have already been six of them although the first were before the Russian invasion of Ukraine After this date the world has changed the geopolitical structure is changing and I imagine that this has also affected the work of the Conference The next plenary will be at the end of April and the final work as mentioned will take place on 9 May The Conference 's plenary sessions discuss the recommendations made by the national panels of European countries and citizens and the contributions collected by the multilingual digital platform This digital platform would be the backbone of the Conference which as Mr Malan recalled is an experiment of participatory democracy Beautiful as an idea it is a pity that the numbers of participation in the method and also in the merit of contributions are a bit tristanzuoli and make us raise doubts and doubts When the Conference concludes its work on 9 May the Council the Commission and Parliament will receive the recommendations contained in a report some of which I stress contain clear indications of the need to revise the founding Treaties of the European Union I would like to remind you that the last revision in this area dates back to 2007 with the signing of the Lisbon Treaty But the point is that Brussels will have to choose whether to follow up the proposals of the citizens or whether to interpret the final common document as a sort of indicative direction of work hence basically a useless thing without affecting either the Treaties or the structure of the European Union at this point let me say betraying the confidence of the citizens In essence there are many legitimate doubts about the outcome of the Conference that unique opportunity would become perhaps already a wasted opportunity There are also doubts about the method of work the representativeness and the sample of delegates the national citizens panels only six Member States in fact have set up them and other doubts about which Mr Malan spoke I add further doubts and concerns as our colleague Carlo Fidanza MEP of the Group of European Conservatives and Reformists has done in Brussels who has asked to know the costs without having answered his question what budgets have been used and what costs are planned in the end It is already estimated that the Commission has spent EUR 22 million and Parliament EUR 1.2 million and we could continue Then there is a doubt as to the effectiveness of participatory democracy how the whole Conference was organized and also how all proposals for reform of the Treaties will not be taken into account This means that there is a risk that this unique opportunity will eventually become a lost even wasted opportunity I am also referring to what was recently said in an interview by President Giorgia Meloni the Conference on the future of Europe often called with emphasis unfortunately risks being a great opportunity lost because it brings with it a vice of origin a pre-packaged result endorsed by a few hundred willing and respectable citizens but certainly excuse me ladies and gentlemen they cannot represent 450 million Europeans We must then have the courage to look at reality and call things by their name As Mr Malan said there is a risk of imposing a single thought Once again a fundamental choice has been made and this is an expression that I have already used in this House a long time ago what does Europe want to do when it grows up This was a good opportunity to understand it because we must always distinguish between function mission and identity That is what Europe needs to question We have our own model of Europe as illustrated in our motion a confederation of sovereign national states Europe should ask the peoples the Member States but above all the citizens if they think it is more interesting to know for example what they must eat or not eat or for example what is pulsating within the hearts of the peoples of Europe
"Mr President Mr President in Office of the Council members of the Government ladies and gentlemen the next European Council will discuss Russia 's military aggression against Ukraine the energy issue and the dependence of some European countries on imports of gas oil and coal from Russia We will also discuss the effects of the pandemic security and defence issues and as you Mr Draghi also mentioned the approval of the strategic compass It is on this particular subject that I am speaking The strategic compass after almost two years of gestation conceived therefore in times of peace is adopted in a dramatic moment that is in times of war It was approved by the Council of the European Union on 21 March and is expected to be formally adopted at the next European Council It is clear that this document takes into account the current geopolitical structure and the Ukrainian crisis However the document has a long term ambition and among its concrete objectives that of strengthening overall the security of the Union and outlining its strategic prospects for the next five to ten years in relation to the threats facing Europe No one escapes that the geopolitical framework is increasingly complex and that there are numerous outbreaks of instability and hybrid and unconventional threats In addition to the traditional crisis scenarios in the immediate neighbourhood namely the Western Balkans North Africa the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East to the eastern border of Europe we cannot forget the new tense scenarios in regions further away from Europe as well as the persistence of the terrorist threat In this increasingly complex international and global context Europe aims to strengthen its defence capacity and according to the compass it does so through four pillars action security investment and partners In a nutshell as the President in Office of the Council reminded us the process of action provides for the establishment by 2025 of a rapid deployment force of 5,000 units capable of operating in conflict scenarios in regions of interest to the European Union This rapid deployment corps is expected to be multinational inter force and multi-domain it is not a European army but a joint emergency unit The second area of the compass that of security provides specific attention to cyber domains and space which are increasingly subject to strategic competition and also provides for the strengthening of cybersecurity common intelligence capabilities as well as the adoption by 2023 of a space strategy for security and defence It is also expected to increase the capabilities of the National Armed Forces in disaster and emergency interventions in support of the civilian population The chapter on safety also provides for the coordinated expansion of the presence of European military navies on the key routes for the Union but also in the indopacific area in order to guarantee maritime safety and freedom of navigation The third pillar investment among other things commits States to increasing defence expenditure in order to fill some strategic gaps in national instruments and reduce technological and industrial dependence The investment chapter also provides for an increase in Community resources to be allocated to the European Defence Fund in the next multiannual budget of the European Union The final chapter of the compass is devoted to partnerships and underlines the commitment to be deepened and the political dialogue on security and defence issues at all levels multilateral regional and bilateral confirming at multilateral level cooperation with NATO and the UN but also as I recall with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE with the African Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations Overall the strategic compass thus provides the European Union with an action plan to strengthen its role in the field of continental and global defence and security in short a guide for action and a programmatic path towards common security in the five operational domains land sea air space and cyber The strategic compass represents for us a significant and important first step in the direction of a Europe of defence The European Union therefore assumes as the President in Office of the Council recalled a responsibility to become an actor capable of contributing to international security and to that of the European continent But let us repeat ladies and gentlemen that this is only a first step and the point is and will be to achieve and how to do so what has been established according to the time limits planned for 2030 We therefore reiterate that this is a first step or a step forward if you prefer to promote peace and stability and to ensure security and cooperation at European and international level However I would point out that this is certainly not the point of arrival for European defence We also believe that in the process which should lead to credible European security and in this we call the attention of the Government it is necessary for every step to involve the Italian Parliament in its competences It will be necessary in every step of implementation of the planned roadmap to defend national sovereignty If the strategic compass wants to represent a balance between Europeanism and Atlanticism pursuing the line of synergy between the European Union and NATO for Brothers of Italy in this direction no transfer of national sovereignty can be considered We also hope that this strategic instrument will have a strong positive impact on the entire national economy and in particular contribute to the technological and industrial development of the defence sector including I stress small and medium sized enterprises as well as in the field of security and airspace The political judgement on the strategic compass is conditional on what will be its real and progressive application it is also dependent on the forms of European coordination that it will be able to guarantee and I stress the role that Italy will be able to play in this renewed European context The issue is always about political division and not just about the aspects of defence because what really makes the difference is having or not having a common European foreign policy and never abdicating to the principle of the sovereignty of the nations It is also a question of guaranteeing European forces equal dignity in synergy with the allied forces Brothers of Italy ladies and gentlemen as you know does not support this today that the strategic compass is born and does not support it now that Europe is upset by a unilateral military attack put on the ground by the Russian Federation against Ukraine a free and independent sovereign state The same strategic compass also had to reconsider itself in the light of what happened in Ukraine and also its way of exercising a role as peacekeeper and as a security guarantor In short the European Union which is often so pervasive in the lives of the Member States even on matters such as nutrition DOC and PDO products the sick bollets of the nutritious score has proved to be absent and weak in some appointments with history As a political force Brothers of Italy has always criticized a fanatical European Union for being a bureaucratic and economic giant and for nothing worried about being a dwarf in foreign policy After 24 February everything changed and Europe will have to decide what to do when it grows up"
Madam President on 26 November 2021 the so called Quirinale Treaty between the Italian Republic and the French Republic for enhanced bilateral cooperation between Italy and France was signed in Rome Today this Assembly is called as my colleague recalled to the ratification of this Treaty after the passages in the parliamentary committees and the approval in the Chamber last May with the vote against by Brothers of Italy The importance of this agreement is not under discussion here Indeed the Agreement is certainly very important and for this I would say it is likely to have serious consequences What we want to stress is a lack of method and some potential defects and also risks I would say of merit Meanwhile it is worth remembering that the idea of the Treaty was born in a bilateral summit of 2017 during the then PD Government of Gentiloni and the Italian left has never stopped since then to become spokesperson of the French interests in Italy while for Brothers of Italy the national interest is priority In fact while the Quirinale Treaty was being built France tried to implement unilaterally without any legal basis as the chronicle has shown to what we call the pirate Treaty of Caen which would have taken away precious territorial waters of course in favour of France A treaty which has fortunately never been ratified by Parliament as you know also thanks to the Brothers of Italy who has always denounced it and strongly contested it First of all this is a question of method because the signing of the Treaty was preceded by non-transparent or even secret negotiations and in any case without a preliminary discussion in Parliament In essence ladies and gentlemen the Treaty has been signed in absolute secrecy should we say so Then it was brought into the Commissions without particular emphasis as if it were a marginal act or mere formality However this is not the case because the Treaty provides for important commitments on equally important matters I mention only a few even for those who are not listening such as the space part which NATO has identified as the fourth domain and therefore an important area but also matters such as industry defence and climate policy provisions going through the issue of borders I stress this and migration issues I stress this to arrive at the non-marginal economic issues of trade which are also largely covered by this Understanding particularly Article 5 The French President Macron at the signing ceremony of the Treaty to the Quirinale seems to have pointed out that this Treaty filled the absence of an Italian French agreement similar to the 1963 Elysée Treaty agreed between Paris and Berlin President Macron forgot
Please Senator Rauti continue RAUTI FdI Thank you Mr President President Macron forgot to point out what appears however today even more as an anomaly of which everyone seems to have forgotten but we do not we refer to the Treaty of Aachen a sort of iron treaty that France signed with Germany in 2019 in particular on the issues of defence and he did so let us remember whistling away Italy the repercussions on Italy and also on the rest of the other European countries That too must be said Dear colleagues the feeling is that in Paris you like to receive white delegations and establish the rules of the game It is also for this reason that at least it is legitimate to doubt that Italy will not obtain great advantages from the subscription of this enhanced cooperation The supporters of the Italian French partnership the fanatics those whom someone with a neologism called the Dracron it is clear that neologism is born argue instead that it is a political instrument to overcome disagreements at European bilateral level It is a treaty marked by the desire to strengthen the core of the European Union thus building a strategic alliance between Paris and Rome I mean a lot of stuff looks like a bit of a dialect Brothers of Italy on the other hand believes and I come to the questions of merit that the Franco Italian Treaty determines and I do not use terms a subordination of our nation to France in extremely important areas such as those I have already mentioned while some were chatting but I also add in the financial agri food and of course political fields However the enhanced cooperation with France which we have signed coincides with a series of instrumental claims on borders that have no historical and legal basis A dramatic example is the long standing and unresolved issue of Mont Blanc on which France declares as if nothing were happening that it would lose the copy of the maps annexed to the Treaty of Turin of 1860 that it defined in an unequivocal way what the border line was It 's good to remind her of these things So ladies and gentlemen it continues to surprise us not only that such an important treaty has been studied and concerted in a non-transparent situation without a real political and parliamentary debate but also that this happens in the almost total silence of the media On the contrary we cannot hide some of our concerns such as immigration commitments because the bilateral agreement between Italy and France risks once again being penalised for our country which must become a refugee camp and the agreements of Malta teach something We are also very concerned about the repetition of the conduct of some French companies that have acquired at favorable conditions important productive realities of our country such as Parmalat Galbani Invernizzi Vallelata Locatelli to name but a few but I could continue proceeding then in some cases to the relocation of the activities with a great negative fall on the Italian employment induced and we can not be disinterested of this I should like to add and I shall conclude what has happened and could happen again in the banking sector where some French institutions have even shopped in Italy as the cases of BNP Paribas which has acquired the National Labour Bank and Crédit Agricole which has acquired Cariparma and Banca Popolare FriulAdria and unfortunately also in this case ladies and gentlemen I could continue Finally how do we vote for this enhanced cooperation with regard to the deep differences in the Libyan crisis with France not being scrupulous in overcoming Italy and going against the interests of our country I do n't know how you 're gonna put it But one thing I know and we know one thing is certain today and know it it will always be certain Brothers of Italy will watch over this and other treaties will always protect and will never give up in front of any form of transfer of national sovereignty
RAUTI FdI Mr President before we make our proposal for a timetable I would like briefly to explain why we are going to vote on the timetable this morning not having reached the necessary unanimity at the Conference of the Leaders yesterday Unanimity has not been achieved because Brothers of Italy does not agree with the proposal for a timetable which is also abstract because we still do not know how exactly the work of the Commission will be carried out which wants to insert a little time for Thursday evening I want to be clear it is not of course the possible night or night work that frightens us What frightens us is the way we proceed which we might call a drift In fact at the previous Conference of Leaders we had established a timetable with timetables for the beginning and end of work then necessarily modified because we are faced with a lack of work by the Commission Let me explain we should discuss the bill No 2488 of conversion of Decree Law No 221 of 2021 to which the Government 's amendment added other aspects It is therefore an important act concerning health health surveillance and the many measures to control the epidemic The Commission has been summoned and disconcerted more than once and has basically not yet begun its work beyond the general discussion We of Brothers of Italy do not like to do and undo the calendar according to the criterion of haste bending the times that serve the discussion and the comparison for some requirements that do not put first as should be done the importance of the measures and also the function of this Assembly The question in short is certainly not the wristwatch but and we stress this it is a political one I would also add that we are less than a week away from President Mattarella 's words of call during the second oath and I refer in particular to the expression not to compress and not to expand the speaking time in this House which is then conceptually a healthy and sacred principle I would ask colleagues in the League if they can keep quiet because it is only a minute Thank you for your kind attention I said that it is a question of defending the principle of the centrality of Parliament The decree law is very important it deserves time and means of discussion and the many amendments deserve it so we cannot focus on Thursday evening 's slippery weather I can also imagine the hasty way in which the debate will take place with the resignation of someone to discuss the amendments to do before or as has happened in other cases with explanations of vote lodged at the Presidency table and not discussed in this House accompanied even by a freeing applause thus giving up to perform a function These are speeches that then come out because we are not in a bubble and we do not want to finish We therefore think that this hypothesis of rehabilitating the calendar benefits the needs of those who want to return home and not of the discussion indeed it sacrifices the process Why was I talking about drift Because this is not the first time ladies and gentlemen that we must call to mind the importance and centrality of the debate to be held in this House Brusio PRESIDENT The debate is closed Excuse me Senator Rauti Colleagues you must absolutely decrease the tone of the voice or interrupt waiting for Senator Rauti to finish the surgery Please Senator Rauti RAUTI FdI Thank you Mr President for helping me listen I think those who are not interested can safely go out and come back for the vote As I said unfortunately this is not the first time that we have to undergo this if we want to call it elegantly unsystematic I am thinking for example of the times of discussion and approval of the budget law a dramatic thing that we cannot forget both here and in the House with the renunciation of explanations of vote in some cases as I have already mentioned not to mention the last two years characterized by excessive recourse to the decree of urgency and I must say and repeat the almost compulsive appeal to the votes of confidence which frankly are not explained in the face of a maxi-maximity that includes all but us So given the lack of interest in this House I come to our proposal to amend the timetable President in Office of the Council FR Mr President ladies and gentlemen considering that tomorrow is the day of the Foibe remembrance and that tomorrow afternoon there are also demonstrations in this House as well as outside this House we propose that tomorrow morning we begin the debate as planned always in keeping with the work of the Commission of which we do not really know how to do so from 9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and then continue on Friday Then again with regard to the calendar I remind everyone that there are also Saturdays Sundays Mondays and Tuesdays it is not written anywhere that we have to work or pretend to work in the evening to close the work on Fridays at lunchtime That is our proposal
RAUTI FdI Mr President perhaps I do not share every single word of the motion but there are borders like this where we have to choose whether to wage a war of words or the battle of principles That is why I have decided to sign this motion with conviction on which the Extraordinary Commission for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights has worked giving priority to the battle in favour of certain principles With this preannunciation I vote in favour of the Brothers of Italy Group and I would like to say that in my speech I will remain adherent to the theme and motion because this is what we have to discuss today avoiding to get out of the topic also using polemics against other people and since I want to be on the subject I get there Today we take on a responsibility that is important because we officially condemn violence and rape in conflicts and we naturally do so by linking ourselves to a perimeter of a very robust and laboriously conquered international authorising character Obviously we are referring to the role of the International Criminal Court but also to the Geneva Convention to the Rome Statute and then to at least two fundamental and fortunately immortal resolutions of the United Nations Security Council No 1325 of 2000 and No 1820 of 2008 but I could also mention the following three follow up resolutions There is therefore an important and robust perimeter of international law fortunately to which we refer But beyond what is expected we come to the subject Let 's start with the assumption that rape is a weapon of war It has been historically and continues to be so in post modern conflicts Women in short as spoils of war from the rat of the Sabine to the Moroccans of the Ciociaria from the rapes in Sudan Sierra Leone Rwanda Liberia Congo Bosnia and Herzegovina to the victims of ISIS to the victims of Boko Haram until today 's Ukraine It is a practice that has been handed down for centuries a world of violence that has crossed and continues to cross the earth an infinite and cursed history that goes through time This is the hidden side of the war and I want to point out that it is also one of the greatest silences in history it is a black hole that has swallowed thousands of victims The difference is that today the women's and armed conflicts are not a business of women but it is a matter definitively included in human security policies with a strong impact also on international law on that perimeter to which I referred and to which the motion intends to contribute Return to the above mentioned UN resolution No 1325 Women peace and security which is considered for those who follow these issues the mother of successive and related resolutions because it is the first of the United Nations Security Council to deal explicitly with the impact of the war on women but also I stress this the important and fundamental role of women in the resolution of conflicts Women therefore are not only victims but also agents and peacemakers The strength of Resolution 1325 which is an important document and legal instrument is its innovative character because it gives us some basic indications on how to promote a culture that does not discriminate against women how to take all measures to prevent violence how to protect women who are victims of violence how to punish the perpetrators of crimes against women and how to compensate victims of violence The subsequent resolution No 1820 of 2008 thus marks a further step because it comes to linking sexual violence to a war tactic and recognizes the impact that sexual violence has in conflicts defining rapes and other forms of sexual abuse as a war crime and a crime against humanity as our motion also reiterates That is the point it is a crime against humanity Moreover there is the recognition of war rape as an instrument of ethnic cleansing and as a plan of genocide with a strategic and political purpose as a weapon and as a systematic tactic to destabilize terrorize humiliate force the abandonment of the territory reduce to obedience and submission and attention this weapon does not only concern women and children but can concern men and children reduced to slavery because there are many forms of violence For centuries rape and sexual violence have been considered a byproduct of wars they called it collateral damage suffered by women they called it an inevitable effect of conflicts We must overturn this perspective this ancient and cursed rite which has been renewed in modern and asymmetrical conflicts between non-state multidimensional actors in interstate guerrillas which have made these instruments even more violent and have gone even further to strike the civilian population It is against this phenomenon that we absolutely must condemn As Franco Algerinian scholar Karima Guenivet writes in her memorable book entitled Warworms Sexual violence as a new weapon Sexual violence is less and less a consequence of war and more and more a weapon used for the purposes of political terror the eradication of a group a plan of genocide and a will for ethnic cleansing The reality is dramatically this You see ladies and gentlemen this is yesterday 's weapon always and hopefully not tomorrow 's weapon which uses some winners against the losers who use some invaders against the invaders It is a form of bullying and has become a strategic weapon Violence on women and girls but also on men and children in short on the defeated and the invaded whatever the context is a horrendous form that must be condemned as an act that violates fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law and as an unqualified act when it also becomes a strategy of war This is the node now inescapable in international matters of human security women peace and security to restore to this dignity of international human law
"Mr President Mr President in Office of the Council ladies and gentlemen today after five days of psychological thrillers the orchestra of appellism as it has been defined has finally arrived the day that should clarify Italy 's political destiny The first part of your communications Mr President has been straightforward because you have finally explained the reasons for your resignation for a choice that you have called distressed and due He also said and I quote this because it is important that a President who did not appear to the Italians needs a strong majority exactly what you Mr President do not have So we can only agree and that is why the Brothers of Italy Group not from today but from the beginning of this tortured legislature which has already seen three governments with today I would say three and a half governments not an expression of a popular mandate asks to return to the polls We have been asking for this since the beginning of this parliamentary term in order to have a strong political and popular mandate from the Italians and even more so today Mr President because you have a majority which is weaker and more divided than a week ago when you decided to resign Today in this House to this contradictory majority of itss which I would call its main weakness it has asked I quote again to reconstruct from the outset It does n't show which glue you believe if you really believe it that you can rebuild your government from scratch In fact in the second and third parts of your communications you have had you give me the expression a bad word for everyone that is a direct stocking to every force of the present government Of course there are also children and stepchildren there because he has mened more the League and the Movimento 5 Stars while he has pampered the PD That 's not new Of course you Mr President with your speech and your communications have taken a few pebbles off your shoes but in this way you have also delegitimized your current Executive When you listed we listened carefully the key points of the government programme in order to rebuild what you called pact what you missed you spoke about the deadlines of the PNRR tax reform social agenda support for Ukraine and more You have listed a whole series of points which are not those which your present majority has put before you these days and you have also asked this House essentially for full powers You also know that with regard to some of the points of your government programme cross vetoes will soon arrive I think for example of the fourth decree of support for Ukraine you know what I mean I think of the reform of the land register that the League does not share and we could continue You Mr President more than a government program with a vision to pull a few months seemed to have wanted to draw an electoral program with which you could come to the elections and submit to the Italians judgment Then I come to another very important point because you have argued and stressed that you have been very impressed by a kind of epidemic induced by appeals to remain that has spread over the last three days He mentioned them thanked them speaking precisely of civil society and of undeserved support that would give them associations schools universities the world of the economy the world of journalism mayors I also remember that these are 2,000 mayors out of 8,000 and I do not think I have read an appeal from the regional Governors or perhaps I have distracted myself He concluded by saying in some way delegitimizing Parliament itself that you remain because the Italians ask you to do so Then why do n't we ask the Italians Why do n't you ask the Italians what they think Or maybe the political thermometer polls are worth it which do n't say exactly what you came to tell us But ask the Italians ask the Italians how they do it in democratic systems they are called elections and they are not exactly an apocalypse It is not a question of letters but it is a way of expressing consensus political judgment and liking because it is worth remembering at this point sovereignty belongs to the people who express themselves by voting and elections She remains therefore because the Italians would ask her but she does not ask the Italians it is strange Then of course it remains I forgot because Europe asks it like everything else of course Europe itself but when you vote in other countries because you vote in other countries even before the deadline if it is necessary does not allow interference before the vote The vote is analyzed the next day in the case of Italy we are told who should be running whether you should vote or not to vote In short Europe wants to tell us everything and we that is you also thank you for these advices So Mr President that Europe that asks you to remain is the same Europe that does not want to share for example our request to put a roof at the price of gas So when we say Europe we say a lot of other things but we move on An intelligent journalist and fine political analyst like Antonio Padellaro therefore above all suspicion in a recent interview with Libero said that in the success of Giorgia Meloni and Fratelli d'Italia electoral success among other things recorded in the various rounds that have been there since 2018 and estimated in the polls that would make Brothers of Italy the first party he reads the symbol of the ransom of parliamentary democracy a revolt against the hypothesis of a Draghi-a I suggest you read this article Do you not think therefore that in addition to the letters of support Italy is different and it is also another Well we believe it because we know it and we meet it every day that Italy there The problem is that that Italy you have taken hostage with your quarrels and your begas of the Palace and you insist on dragging a legislature only for logic of electoral survival and for some important state nominations If in today 's day after all this everything were to remain as it is well then you joked while you created a collective suggestion that the vote would trigger the Apocalypse and it is not so So Mr President since let us remember there is always a government in office that can run the ordinary administration so there is no need to make psychological terrorism let us also say that you want to prevent elections because you are afraid of the judgment of the people and the outcome of the elections You do n't understand how in a few months you could solve all the problems that the Government of the Best has n't solved and dealt with in a year and a half I should like to conclude and I would also like to put it mildly ladies and gentlemen We 've discovered an unsuspecting ironic vein in you President Draghi In the foreign press conference you told a delightful joke about heart transplant saying that it would be better to choose the heart of an 80 year old banker than a young heart because that banker the heart never used it great laughs from the press She certainly knows the bankers so maybe she did n't even joke we do n't know if it was irony or self irony Then allow me to make a joke and that is what I shall conclude in this House now almost depopulated despite the importance of the subject Colleagues I want to draw your attention you will all remember that memorable movie by Scola played by Alberto Sordi and Nino Manfredi entitled Will our heroes be able to find the mysteriously deceased friend in Africa The film ends with the unforgettable Titì nun lascià you will all remember Titino in the end what did he do He jumped off the boat did not return to Italy and responded to the call because in the meantime Titino had become the sorcerer of that indigenous village Mr President ladies and gentlemen irony aside Brothers of Italy expect a leap of pride from Mario Draghi so his resignation confirmed and not a Draghi bis that if there is will be even paler and weaker than that begun in February 2021 In short the scenarios change but the fateful and not lucky whatever it takes by Mario Draghi remains It is a at any cost that however does not resemble forgive me neither courage nor a healthy obstinacy it is very similar to the therapeutic aggression of all those political forces that are afraid to face the elections and that in order to keep you as a guarantee of their positions of power have blocked the way to the Quirinale yesterday and today want to block the path of the elections and the judgment of the Italian people"
Mr President when for the first time Brothers of Italy asked for a session of Parliament on national security the situation had not yet fallen Unfortunately the military aggression against Ukraine and the ongoing war have made today 's debate even more urgent necessary and dramatic What is happening demonstrates the importance both of the security of the Republic and of any decision taken not only in the field of defence but also in those of energy technology the digital economy and infrastructure Among the important issues of the report are European defence and national security assets that should be central to any political decision But it is on another fundamental aspect that I am speaking namely energy security which is a crucial part to be presided over within a comprehensive strategy to defend national interest and on which the report reiterates the need for strengthening in the terms of so called economic intelligence On the energy issue the Copasir presented last January a report to Parliament as President Urso recalled highlighting the criticalities of the system and the vulnerability both in the face of the hegemonic action of the state actors and the necessary ecological transition In the same report a number of solutions were also put forward which are fortunately the subject of urgent decrees or which are in the process of being evaluated The report clearly stressed the need to implement an energy security plan that would progressively reduce our dependence on other countries and especially on the Russian Federation aiming at energy independence and productive and technological autonomy in collaboration of course with Western European partners also in view of the geopolitical factors and risks that were being foreshadowed The report also states that The current scenario presents further weaknesses linked to the increase in prices in particular gas which has occurred in recent months and which is likely to mark the immediate future As we know unfortunately that was the case On these issues the Committee has indicated the need and urgency to adopt a national energy security plan aiming at an adequate technological and also productive autonomy of the country in the field of energy through the strengthening of national industrial and research chains Today ladies and gentlemen we are in a state of emergency and the situation could also lead us from here on I say it could to abandon Russia 's gas and oil in whole or in part and this is also one of the many dramatic consequences of the ongoing conflict but it is clear that today we are also facing mistakes of the past and wrong energy choices or not choices that have made us dependent on others and more vulnerable than other European partners We too will face the costs of sanctions especially as a result of the price of energy and that is why Brothers of Italy calls for action at European and international level so that costs are shared equally between the different European countries and the Western Alliance But it is not enough ladies and gentlemen Brothers of Italy believe that a plan of energy security is needed and that more energy must be produced in Italy with all possible instruments from the increase of the current gas production in the existing deposits to the new renewable energy plants a necessary combination to achieve the objective of energy independence without which we stress there can be no other kind of independence The ongoing war places the energy issue at the heart of global attention The surge in petrol and diesel prices is a reality with which we are all unfortunately accounting every day The same applies unfortunately to the generalized increases as it stretches we have had confirmation even today the shadow of the speculative spirals to be blocked to stop the escalation of the lists It is necessary to strike those who are jackaling on the tragedy of war as requested by Brothers of Italy also through a motion presented to the House In conclusion Mr President I must stress certain aspects of the report which I believe are of interest to this debate Energy is a social resource that is it is a universal right that should be guaranteed it is certainly also an environmental resource and it is a commodity but it should never become a weapon of geopolitical blackmail And yet it happens and it's happening It is for this reason ladies and gentlemen that we must have an energy policy that responds to the emergency and is able to plan the future as well But Italy must recover mistakes and delays because an energy policy is missing and lacking Meanwhile in order to face the emergency Brothers of Italy calls for an immediate reduction of excise duties and VAT on fuel costs Moreover I stress the reduction of the tax burden on fuels would not lead to any loss because these increases had not been estimated and represent a so called extra throw for the treasury chests We must immediately in our opinion correct the shot think about a strategy of energy independence because there are entire supply chains I do not mention them that risk stopping companies forced to close down or to reduce production Families are struggling to survive Even on the dear bills Brothers of Italy had launched already at the beginning of the year a cry of alarm and criticized a financial maneuver that provided for the increase only one and a half billion a clearly inadequate figure so much so that in January the Government had to intervene with other decrees to calm the bills but it is not enough as we have seen It would not be objective to attribute to the ongoing conflict everything that is happening in our economy because many crisis factors were already present in the last months of 2021 and the prices of all raw materials had already grown without the government in our opinion addressing the situation adequately The war has created a short circuit and we are chasing emergencies Ladies and gentlemen I would like to conclude by saying that today 's debate must help us find the necessary measures because Italians cannot support further sacrifices and do not deserve a Government that is still in the face of what was already an epochal socio-economic crisis that the consequences of the ongoing conflict are worsening dramatically launching new challenges hybrid and multidimensional threats
CANDURA L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to greet you and all my fellow Members First of all when talking about Armed Forces the first thought is the expression of gratitude to what women and men in uniform are doing for the country to what they have done and to everything they will do That 's my first thought With regard to the measure under consideration I think of the first mission of the armed forces the protection of the life and freedom of citizens within the borders of the nation We had a very recent example of this the engagement of the armed forces during the pandemic not only for the function of public order but above all for the support of military health to civil health at that time especially in 2020 of great fear and great uncertainty for the whole country and for all our fellow citizens It is no coincidence that Article 9 of the measure explicitly mentions a strengthening of military health personnel The need for this measure as already mentioned by the President derives from a law n. 244 of 2012 which was inserted in a context austerity and linear cuts which did not only damage the armed forces but also to health If in 2020 Italy faced the health emergency I do not say with difficulty but certainly with great effort with an Italian health care fatigued this is due to the legacy of reckless linear cuts required by a mentality of economic policy that I personally did not share then and I still do not share The law of parliamentary initiative is coming and I would like to thank my colleague Mr Ferrari one of the first signatories to the Chamber of Deputies for this and I would like to thank Parliament not only our Commission and the President but the whole Parliament in its two Chambers because I would like to remind you that this measure is coming from Parliament It comes from Parliament because it is a necessity of the country to strengthen the instrument of defence I will not repeat what many colleagues have said very well but I would like to remind everyone of the need to think of the Armed Forces as an investment to avoid future losses just like for health they are investments that are made to protect our citizens On the other hand considering the chronicle and the historical period that we are living in I think that this is clear even to the most closed minded people let 's say on this front Clearly I advance the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Group Partito Sardo d'Azione on this measure and take the opportunity to thank all the members of the Defence Commission President Donatella Tesei Laura Garavini Daniela Donno and our current President Roberta Pinotti because if we worked in harmony as already mentioned in some intervention this did not rain from heaven but it depended on the sensitivity of those who led the Commission from our Donatella Tesei to Senator Pinotti and also on the sensitivity of those who were members of it It was a very interesting experience for me too Vice President at the first legislature I hope a vote in favour and convinced of this measure it is in the interest of the country and is only the starting point The next item is the G9.1 first by Senator Gasparri who also bears my signature has already been presented and is a perspective We do not stop at this we invite the Government to be guardian of this measure and the next Parliament to improve the situation and invest I repeat in the armed forces as a means of protecting our country
Minister I can think of at first glance the phrase of the Chinese philosopher as well as leader Sun Tzu that is Know your enemy or at least your opponent The first consideration I make is of a geographical nature In the newspapers and even here we are talking about a Ukrainian front but Russia has a somewhat different vision For Russia the entire geographical arc that goes from the peninsula of Kola to the North Sea passes through Eastern Europe and arrives passing through the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the Middle East in the eastern Mediterranean is a single front from the security point of view I make this geographical consideration because it is news of Monday that the cruiser Ustinov as you will know sailed between Calabria and Puglia in the south direction parading in front of the military port of Taranto our base and then make route to Greece and probably to the eastern Mediterranean All these movements of submarines in front of the Ukrainian coast do not have a different military operational meaning than that of Russian submarines and military ships in the North Sea or the Mediterranean because it is all one operating theatre if we can say so The other geographical consideration I would like to make is that we are rightly talking about Ukraine in terms of violated sovereignty economic and social problems there are refugees dead and wounded but for Russia the problem is again a security issue All the invasions that the Russian people have historically suffered come from the West It is clear that Napoleon and Adolf Hitler are certainly not Europe today and they do not represent us in any way But psychologically the support of the Russian population to President Putin someone called him the tsar comes from this Encircling syndrome is not something theoretical or a whim of the newspapers but it is something felt within the Russian population And it is a very important factor if we want to democratize Russia And when we compare ourselves with it we have to take into account things of the vision of our competitor We do this in a relationship of friendship and we do it even when we fight we must know our enemy Then the fact that the precept comes from Asia know your enemy and in Europe Socrates said know yourself underlines again the diversity of vision of life and man between two cultures So in this vision we are also talking about the manifestation of intentions The recognition of the sovereignty and independence of these two Republics is a violation of Ukraine 's legitimate sovereignty Ukraine is not part of NATO but on 12 June 2020 Ukraine became an opportunity partner of NATO It is not a partner role in the sense of an ally but it is intended to ensure interoperability between the military systems of the partner country and the rest of the Alliance Clearly if I put myself from the Russian point of view as I have just said I can not see in this something aimed at peace and cooperation I am pleased it is a sacred principle that you have spoken about the principle of the open door NATO is open to all states that want to be part of it It is right that it should be open and it is right that Ukraine with a democratic government should be asked to be a part of it The NATO Russia Council I remember the 2003 Maritime Practice Summit had also begun a path that seemed extremely promising but not all the countries of the world agree even in the West with this vision which I share Here an Englishman who surely knows you helps us he is Halford Mackinder the great father of geopolitics who spoke of Heartland the heart of the Earth the Euro Asian continent Who controls the Eurasian continent which goes from Vladivostok to the shores of the Atlantic controls the world It is clear that the priority for those who are not part of this continent and do not control it becomes opposed to the fact that this immense mass unites and coagulates Hence the need for an enemy Russia and an West separated from Russia What I 'm saying is that democratization and friendship must be something that comes from both sides and not from one What Russia is doing in Ukraine is absolutely illegal from the point of view of international law sanctions are well come but they must have an effect on Russia and not on our citizens I 've heard of some kind of entrepreneurship sacrifice before Well see that a sacrifice for an entrepreneur Italian as from another country is not the sacrifice of a stranger the entrepreneur increases the prices of goods fires fails These are the reactions to such a crisis After that it is our citizens who pay Consequently I hope that the Italian State when the sanctions are declined will help those sectors of the Italian economy affected by the effects of these sanctions I would point out a second element historically speaking In 2014 sanctions were issued in particular in the agri -food sector I am Veneto that have hit the economic fabric of the North East of the country hard Russia at that time imported about 32 percent of foodstuff food materials from abroad Do you know what the reaction to sanctions was In 2021 they imported 12 percent we helped them to be autonomous The potatoes bought first in Central Europe are bought by Kazakhstan I do not know whether those sanctions have had the desired effect they have been disastrous to our economy In order to inspire good will to Russia and Putin I have more than a few doubts There is one thing I would like to stress the question of energy and the coordination of the European Union Minister France and Germany have two completely different energy mixes Germany is abandoning nuclear power and coal relying on gas for ecological transition as required by the taxonomy recently approved by the European Union France is continuing on nuclear power We can well understand that the energy strategy and the strategy towards Russia of these two countries cannot be compatible and cannot be compatible with ours either As a result talking about a common European Union strategy makes me a little smiling how can there be a common European Union strategy even in terms of energy I agree with you Minister we must equip ourselves to deal with crises not only from a geopolitical point of view but also on the demand and supply side But when we have a gas storage capacity across Europe of less than a fifth of the annual consumption where can we go This problem cannot be solved at all because renewable alternative energies will arrive in a few years time when we have solved the problems of energy accumulation and transmission with technology But energy is like the air we breathe we do n't need it in five ten or fifteen years but we need it right away So it is not right in my opinion to rely on tomorrow 's renewable energies to solve a problem that can strangle our economy today and that is simply because it is obvious Just see what is happening in Italy with the expensive bills which is linked to a price trend due to the geopolitical crisis and not only It would be desirable at European level to re-examine the pace of the ecological transition 2035 is approaching and not as a date of hope but as a threat I apologize if I had to stop for breathing problems Thank you Minister and I hope you will defend Italy
Mr President I wish to greet the members of the Government all the honourable Members and all the Members present We have reached many points this evening but I would like to return to the root of the problem Today we are discussing this measure after Vladimir Putin 's government has decided to attack a sovereign state called Ukraine in a proditory and predatory way It is an invasion that has a bit broken the bubble of comfort in which we have lived for decades thinking that these kind of wars belonged to the past at least in our geopolitical quadrant in our area in our Europe No you do n't We have learned with dismay that an isolated state at international level that is not part of a strong alliance is prey to the strongest the most aggressive the most overbearing This leads us first of all to unequivocally condemn from the point of view of international law but also of ethics Vladimir Putin 's government for what it is doing in Ukraine But this also leads us to reflect on a conflict that has only appearance in the military dimension There is a very important political issue When we look at the countries of Eastern Europe we think of sovereign states precisely identified Poland Romania Ukraine itself But if we took the flight and looked from the Kremlin towards the West the vision on that side would not be that of sovereign states but of a security selfish and self centered dimension in a certain sense but understandable at a historical level and illegal and illegitimate under contemporary international law so Ukraine Poland and the Baltic countries do not have the right to choose independently which world to belong to whether to the world of Western democracies or to the sphere of autocracies They simply have to remain at the service of Russia 's security This political vision is absolutely irreconcilable We have a very serious problem which is not simply Russia 's aggression against Ukraine The problem is what we want to do with those principles that we have so far praised and that have proud us at least in words Can a sovereign state decide to join NATO and the European Union or should it be the bully of the neighborhood the referee of the international position of a democracy We as democracies are dependent on Russian gas a colleague of mine said it before and he is right and clearly we must choose whether we are people and countries of principle coherent or whether we must be merchants who sell their principles of freedom in the name of money when talking about the other person We are talking about spending on the defence of our country which is not simply the defence of our country but the defence of NATO and a political system If we do not think that peace which is not submission and freedom which is not anarchy are not discounted values but require sacrifice if we do not put this in our head I repeat it is much better that we close our countries close our parliaments close our defense expenses and give ourselves or sell ourselves to the first bullo of the neighborhood called Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping I recommend that you read the joint statement that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin signed on February 4 2022 twenty days before the invasion and the opening of the Beijing Olympic Games In this statement in addition to the strategic collaboration on various points that I am not here to outline because I do not have the time above all it is reinterpreted to the use and consumption of two dictatorships the concept of democracy saying that there are models and paths of democracy alternative to those that the West selfishly wants to impose on the world and that China and Russia have found their model of democracy because the Chinese and Russian peoples have chosen two non-democratic regimes Think of the circular reasoning democracy is that the people choose not to be governed democratically It is written very clearly and it is shocking I therefore call on those Members who rightly say that peace is a value I do not agree that peace is subjection I share peace but I also share the fact that we must be consistent in defending ourselves and our own principles and if someone among our electors ours in the sense of the whole hemicycle is not convinced of the goodness of military spending for the defense of the country that is for their defence it is our job to teach him to talk about it We cannot bend to fake news and to the propaganda of our opponents which exists because I repeat the policy of dictatorships that say that it is democracy to choose the dictatorship is antithetical to us We therefore have the responsibility not only to support the decree 2 and the action of the Draghi Government but we also have the task of making it clear to our voters of each parliamentary group represented here
BEACHES L SP PSd Az Mr President I too of course thank the rapporteurs Senator Pergreffi and Senator Cioffi all 8a The Commission has committed itself to this rather particular measure and I shall now explain why The code of contracts is a story to write and it's an endless story The contract code what we are talking about and about almost daily can be referred to the legislative decree of 18 April 2016 no 50 The code was necessary because it was an instrument which had to transpose European directives no 23 24 and 25 of 2014 And the ultimate objective was to ensure fundamental values such as flexibility transparency the prevention of corruption the infiltration of organised crime introducing compared to the European directives additional instruments and even new institutions marked by greater rigour without falling into gold plating the practice of introducing levels of regulation higher than the minimum required by the directives This code therefore was to replace a decree of the President of the Republic of 2010 which used a set of guidelines called soft law This change of approach was intended to ensure greater simplicity and slimness It was the goal that had to be achieved In fact however this objective was never achieved because over time instead of adapting to European directives Parliament succeeded by a law of 28 January 2016 No 11 which delegated to the Government for the implementation of directives no 23 24 and 25 of 2014 to put in place the delegation law and two months later bore legislative decree no. 50 of 18 April 2016 Today we are in the exact same situation In 2016 first of all the decree a priori that bearing the decree of the President of the Republic n. 207 of 2010 was replaced with that of 2016 which had to transpose these directives Since 2014 these directives have not yet been transposed although there has been a legislative activity aimed at simplifying and realignment these procedures that have never happened We are in 2022 and we are again here with a delegation law that must transpose the famous directives of 2014 I say this for the sake of clarity because someone may have a vision of the code as a regulatory summary aimed exclusively at lightening simplifying and clarifying the rules governing public contracts and contracts In fact we and I say in general could have implemented and re-aligned all the legislation related to the topic referring to the European legislation compared to which other countries are much ahead of us since 2014 proposing perhaps an instrument that in addition to transposing could take a step further and arrive at the condition to review what is the regulatory compendium itself so as to offer operators and those who make daily use of this code a truly effective and above all immediate instrument Why am I saying this Minister thanking you for your key speech The work that has been done for this delegation is aimed at declining principles and rules that have been dragging on for many years These are rules that should have been implemented before If we ask someone today as he uses the code he knows that one party has been suspended for the intervention of the measure unblocks yards only up to the sub threshold then it went for derogation and something else intervened so the installation of this legislation has also been dismantled to the point that an impressive confusion has been created The measure in our examination declines a number of fundamental criteria but attention a piece is missing not to be in the same situation that we have already experienced If after the adoption of this measure the implementing decrees are not enacted this regulation with all the effort and work that has been done by the Commissions will remain here There is little time colleagues because the criteria contained in it will have to go to support the work of the PNRR which is coming In addition we have to face the high prices of raw materials a war that is almost inside the house and no longer on the doorstep a very difficult social situation a concept of peace that is drifting away If we want to be operational and really direct I ask the Government do n't happen what happened in 2016 when we had to align with the 2014 directives do n't happen again In 2022 we are still here to align ourselves with old situations that have not been taken into consideration this is the last chance we have After that our companies our operators all the stakeholders involved in these measures will be in a position to be unable to operate And not to be operational in the constancy of such dramatic situations means not to give Italy the opportunity to recover and to implement what we have all worked for together which we have approved and which in any case represents a debit for our future generations namely the PNRR The work was done by choosing a different much more limiting measure Now it is up to the Government to implement it in a short time by issuing its implementing decrees and to give the possibility of aligning ourselves like all countries with a European simplification regulation that we should already have This is crucial If we re-propose our thanks we shall vote in favour of the measure in the hope that we will not have to submit a question or a motion on it or worse still read the newspapers to hear us say that it is an empty box 17.40 a.m.
Mr President Senators I will not dwell on the technical aspects of the measure because they have been well expressed by my previous colleagues who have touched on very important articles of the measure that we are going to vote on on This is certainly one of the few times when we have had a measure that has no resources as the rapporteur has said in his statement In fact given the different passages we had to try to legislate on a structure that had a small economic content 30 million This seems at first glance a situation that can give a poor fruit sour that has no meaning Instead in my opinion it is when there is no money or the money is few that you have to put your whole soul and brain in order to try to get something good out As long as there is money the amendments are being prepared 50 million here 10 million there 40 there it is content and not content but it is certainly much more evident the media and political emphasis than to make an amendment or to strive to produce an amendment without economic support which perhaps opens up a range of possibilities and manages to solve a series of situations completely blocked I have not honestly tabled an amendment to this measure but I have followed other colleagues amendments I committed myself because I liked it because it was a very cerebral measure If many of those amendments had been taken into account in a very precise way they would certainly have raised and helped many still unresolved situations Let me give you an example Senator Cantù spoke about the medical issue but hers was certainly a costly amendment so she could not go But there was also the amendment by Senator Alessandrini which referred to a series of municipalities that have economic difficulties in closing a budget and had to find a legal formulation to get out of a impasse Among other things these are municipalities which today in a further critical situation because we have almost the war at home and have made themselves available to help refugees as well as providing essential services will find themselves in a state of uncertainty There was no money but we definitely had to put our heads in more depth I would like to take the example of Mr Fregolent who was already well and who does not know why although there was money and the Ministry 's green light he was lost Then I come back to repeat something I have already said before We are in a state of economic health financial and social emergency We should also be in a state of emergency and give up and I repeat give up for a moment the banks not on an institutional level go a little further and try to fix all those situations in which if for us two months they are nothing for those outside instead there are many I conclude my speech by addressing my very nice colleague Zaffini of Brothers of Italy who has shocked a whole series of very negative situations about how we are not able to make of necessity virtue Forgive me however colleague apart from the empty Chamber which is not good and is not just about you but you who are the expression of the minority should have had the whole claque behind to applaud you strongly for what you have said because that is the only way it has meant what you say in relation to what your party supports outside and within this Chamber As for the others I cannot say otherwise because indeed such a measure which has no economic support but which has the strength to give out should have seen the House full the support of the rapporteurs and the Commission which has tried in every way to do what it could because those who They must understand that ours is not a job for high end wage earners we are people who try at least as far as I am concerned to solve in all problematic ways in emergency
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to begin by thanking first of all those who have spoken before me who have also pointed out certain parts of this measure which is very important However I must point out the scarcity of those present when we talk about the National Resistance and Resilience Plan which we invoke every day as a tool for Italy 's recovery a maximum attention should be paid instead I focus this speech on two fundamental assessments that I have had the opportunity to make in the last few days even quite frantic thanking first of all the Commissions the 1st and the 7th who have worked hard and in general the whole of Parliament in a cross-cutting way It is clear that the political assessments made on the issues and issues of the National Resilience and Resistance Plan often have political convergence so all the members of Parliament agree on amendments proposals and what needs to be done It 's the same with the ministries Unfortunately however after the two realities have to be joined together there is the pulling off The whole of Parliament apart from colour and belongings strongly calls for amendments to be put forward which can in some way simplify and move in the direction of implementing this important instrument which is also being asked of us by Europe And here the Ministries once one once the other do not find convergence or the opposite happens with the Ministries that endorse the amendment and the parties that agree but the Government does not agree This is a way that is not good It is not good because we are at the end of this very difficult and complex legislature which has seen us participate in situations that are out of the ordinary from the pandemic to the war Now we have in our hands an instrument that we should all use well so that we can really take that path of regrowth of real openness that we are asked for On the contrary the same situation is repeated all the time the amendments are proposed with one and this is all the more true in this particular case very strong convergence on the part of all parties but only one party has been maintained And those amendments that have been retained have value but there were so many that could have led to so called simplification and deburocratisation Unfortunately they could not be maintained And let 's not analyze why but basically the reason is the following if it's not the Ministry it 's the Government if it's not the Government it 's the Ministry In the end this Parliament which is a legislator finds itself on the ground And when the territory asks us to account for why we have not been able to bring the amendments we stand by This Parliament is not capable of giving explanations He cannot explain why even if it is a Parliament that legislates he practically has the card but he does not have the pencil or he has the pencil and not the card And that 's too bad This is the first point I wanted to make Here we are talking about the National Plan we are talking about billions and debt for the future of our children So maybe it 's time to make a turnaround too I would like to say this with all due respect for the Government but this is a Parliament of people elected and deserves respect Every now and then try to listen to and welcome what comes from us because we are bearers of the interests of Italians and not personal There are quite positive measures I am referring for example to local authorities who are the ones who will then have to implement the National Plan and have more difficulties I am referring above all to the small municipalities those who have not been able to undertake the recruitment process and have asked to have at least the opportunity to make the detachment in order to be able to help one another No this could n't be done Yet especially the smaller municipalities of the South where there is the greatest amount of money they will find themselves unable to help each other Something has passed but with respect to the total installation the local authorities responsible for the implementation of this remain on the stake And paradoxically they remain at the stake on the National Plan which is what Europe is asking of us because we must respect it The European recommendations are also important but we are full of infringements since over the last 20 years we have not taken on a number of recommendations The recommendations are important but it is equally important for the government to sit at a European table and say that each state has its own peculiarities and particularities If recommendations mow half of the amendments that can implement the PNRR that Europe itself tells us to implement it is clear that we are facing a dog that bites its tail and becomes ridiculous in front of a Europe that is a step forward Let us not ask ourselves then why the ballot boxes are empty and why there is so much distance We who are Members of the European Parliament are trying to lighten up and unravel with this measure we are bringing things home with great effort from the Commissions but also with a series of obstacles that today which we are trying to open up are ridiculous This is the process that must be overcome In fact if you do not overcome the process of interference and closure you will never be able to really make a change and be concrete There will always be the Ministry the Minister or those who do not want and will not be able to achieve the goal However we are not joking about this because as my colleague said earlier we have to think about who will come after us The children and grandchildren whom we also have will be those on whom the difficulties we encounter every day will fall and who have not had the ability I speak of all to overcome And this is not about amendment 6.5 but about the procedure and the ability to be innovative and adapt to the times This means looking for a different rhythm that rhythm that we have not yet found
Mr President ladies and gentlemen this measure is very important It is now known my way of intervening so as always I start with a thought that is not mine because you can find it anywhere but I think it is important to quote What is family The role of the family is very important in the life of each of us because it helps us in times of difficulty accompanies us advises us helps us to make decisions corrects us rejoices with us when we are successful always hoping for the best for us The family is the first environment in which the individual is inserted and relations with the family contribute to providing many of the fundamental tools for community integration The educational project of the family requires harmony between the various members of the family itself balanced growth of their personalities and this project is often carried out in an unconscious way through the creation of a network of relationships and messages which defines the mutual expectations and identity of those who are part of it Without the family you can feel lost not alone This is the first thought I have because the role of the family is fundamental for each of us You can find this everywhere but often this description is not consistent with the present way of life Often the role of the family as we see every day has been deformed debased in some way has been reduced to a mere name the family It 's often said you 're 40 now you have to make a family After a few years the same person who created a family might say I can't do this because I keep family Over the years the support which I have well explained here as a founding part of an individual loses value to the point of becoming a burden The family is a burden the children can be a burden the grandparents the uncles the elderly become a burden everything is reduced to a purely economic situation it costs too much I can't do it I can't Therefore that fundamental concept which should belong to each one of us from the moment of birth and in the path of his life is completely disregarded This discourse is linked to the measure under discussion and to the delegation to the Government of certain objectives that are fundamental because they give the possibility in such dark and difficult times as those we are going through not to lose the meaning of this fundamental concept of family We must help the family in all areas we must support it from an economic point of view we must help parenthood help women who want to work and at the same time want to be mothers we must help families because in these modern times the very concept of family has been lost Perhaps a hundred years ago there were no mobile phones there were no iPads there was no technological connection but there was the supply chain the true sense of the family the enlarged families who helped each other the one with the most willingness helped the poorest there was a relationship indeed a network of relationships that made the family a group of large families and for years in the growth of man and society it was so With time however modernity with its challenges that we have grasped has significantly changed the way of pigs but paradoxically reversing however the founding role of the family reducing it to a problem This measure on the other hand supports it and will certainly have to be completed because it contains delegations we know that the delegation to the Government must be exercised that we must get to concrete facts and its implementation The draft law in question regulates and brings together a whole series of rules already in place helping the family the children and all the aspects that I have touched on thus giving the opportunity to resume and revive the concept of family that we have gradually seen lost There are also many daily news reports in the newspapers that tell us about families in which there are dramatic situations about families who do not arrive at the end of the month and who do terrible acts and about children living in situations of great discomfort It is also important for citizens to know that the Government is putting in place a series of measures aimed at filling what very banally must be called loneliness being alone in dealing with certain problems I hope that this is only the beginning of the reordering of what has already been done aware that surely you cannot reach everything and everyone but that it is a first step that must be oriented towards further attention to this segment of life that we carry inside often accompanied by the feeling that it is not important enough Instead the family is because we all have a small or a large family maybe ours is well and has no problems but to turn the thought to those who have great difficulties is important Let me at this moment even if it has nothing to do with it turn my thoughts it is a constant thought that I have to those who no longer have the family because they are at war War does not give discounts to anyone the family in war loses it in the worst way cruelly and leaves a void that marks Past history has taught us and we have many significant testimonies of the past but apparently man has a short memory otherwise we should not see what we see the lonely children the destroyed families and what this situation will bring us Therefore let us prepare for us but also for others for those we welcome that we will have to welcome because they no longer have the family and if we make a serious and profound reflection we know that they have not only loneliness but an immense wound that money is not enough to repay
Mr President I would like to say a few words first of all by thanking the offices that have worked with us for the drafting of this document and by accompanying us here in the Chamber I would like to say a special thank you to all the Commissions and all their members because they have examined the part of the DEF of their competence and have provided comments have advanced criticism and offered constructive ideas Allow me only at the end of this journey to formulate a small thought We must face this document of economy and finance in its particular delicacy but the DEFs are not born ex novo when a new legislature is started but they continue to travel in time carrying of course what has been done in the past so from time to time with the start of a legislature the new political group takes note and makes its choices which can be good shared or not The 18th legislature will pass through history because it has gone through one of the most difficult times since the post war period with a pandemic that has not yet left behind and with a war almost at home near with all that has resulted When we look at the numbers then when we read between the lines of this Document we parliamentarians must also be aware that we have done and done a difficult job but not only because it is the result of something that comes from the past and that perhaps we have not been able or not wanted to change but of an extraordinary historical context I repeat These are not words that serve to soften a difficult situation I humbly say this without claiming to teach anyone anything and respecting the sensibilities of each of you but when you return to your territories you will have to explain well to your people we come from all over Italy what it means to make the accounts square it is not only a mathematical calculation but it is the result of a series of situations that are continuously in progress today there are and next week there will be no because there are variables that have not occurred since the post war period Only in this way will we all have the opportunity to make this document ours and to be constructive and courageous to the maximum and to encourage this Government to make everything that is in place truly concrete
Mr President I will take four if I can Dear colleagues Government I thank the speakers and of course the Government in the people of the Undersecretary War and undersecretary Freni I would also like to thank the offices for the commitment that in the proliferation of measures for two years now is particularly intense But let me say ladies and gentlemen that in four years we have learned nothing in the management of the work It is true that among very diverse political forces majority agreements become complicated But in any case we should all agree that we should not be able to finish work at night this time even in the night between Sunday and Monday It is not a problem for us but more than anything else it is a problem of work the work done at night risks being not serious and leading to mistakes which although small must inevitably be settled later I will never tire of saying that at night we should sleep and not work on important measures Having said that it can be said that the measure in question is in the right direction With it the Government has begun to accept the requests received in particular by our Group and our secretary Matteo Salvini who had not been suspicious since time had warned about the dangers of increases and energy increases It is certainly a good start to take further wider measures That is why I will not dwell so much on what we are going to approve in my speech Moreover many of the amendments we have signed including through cross-cutting agreements have received the Government 's favourable opinion and the Commission 's vote in favour On the other hand I would like to raise awareness of all of you ladies and gentlemen about what is the real plan and the institutional plan that is two plans that are difficult to meet We are all aware of the increases in the cost of raw materials energy and inevitably the shopping cart but entrepreneurs were aware of the phenomenon of the increase of raw materials since the beginning of 2021 So ladies and gentlemen this epilogue was inevitable partly because we may not have been able to hear enough Then everything went down and was accelerated by the war of course but the assumptions were already evident We need to learn to pick up the signals that the real world gives us There is a part of this Parliament that seeing evaders everywhere and the clever around every corner believes that with laces and laces they hinder these twists But that political part often does not realize that the complications of procedures do nothing but facilitate bureaucracy professionals and smart people who know how to circumvent the rules So listen to the entrepreneurs of those healthy companies those companies that work honestly Mine wants to be an appeal for the next steps At this serious time of economic crisis it is not so important to give but to avoid removing to avoid collecting as has been done for excise duties on fuels on the other hand Let us simplify the procedures let us lower taxation for companies and workers because only then will they be able to deal with the economic problems also due to the conflict but we still do not hear them today because they still have to come So let 's listen to entrepreneurs and families and let 's all get down in reality
Mr President ladies and gentlemen this very important measure acts in a simple way on our Constitution but it adds a fundamental piece a subject which is always a little neglected by these classrooms but which is so important for mental and physical well being Let 's talk about sports It should be remembered for those who listen that the only article in this draft Constitutional law goes to add these words to Article 33 of the Constitution The Republic recognizes the educational social and promotional value of the psychophysical well being of sport in all its forms I have always supported him and I have already supported him on several occasions in this House As a former cyclist passionate about this complete sport that gives wellness to the body and spirit today I say finally Finally this step is being taken in the right direction It is recognizing the value of sport of all sports that are a real touch for the physical and mental health of citizens Everyone should practice a sport Sport is a master of life In cycling the ascent teaches that in order to reach the summit you have to commit You have to be stubborn We must also suffer and thus reach the goal which is also satisfaction and satisfaction Then comes the descent You taste freedom but only after you have conquered it with the ascent Those who practice competitive sport know that practice teaches a method sport becomes discipline teaches to be part of society Team sports practiced since the young age teach to be an active part of a group of people with a common goal and so called individual sports teach to belong to a community that sharing the same passion also shares the principles Those who practice sports develop an exceptional physical strength and in any case a lower propensity to illness In fact people with health problems often find sports a valuable ally to overcome them thus making less and less use of pharmaceutical care Finally I would like to mention sports in disability I had the honour of meeting a beautiful girl who is no longer there today Sara Stealto Piedmontese who had made sport in disability her mission of life He also met Minister Stefani Sara had a weak heart which caused her some problems but with sport she accompanied the disabled Bringing the culture of sport into disability had also surpassed his disability Sport made her a strong person not a sick person With his Giro d'Italia solidaritye about fifty stages with arrival in Turin he brought this message throughout Italy bringing so many disabled people closer to sport Today Sara is gone but she would have been happy to see this passage that we are making here in the Senate today For this reason with the commitment to continue the valuable work that Sara was doing today I firmly thank Parliament for this important initiative which must be a first step in promoting sport at all levels and giving the right importance and dignity to sports practice
Mr President ladies and gentlemen this is the last decree law to be converted by this Parliament It 's all very singular and unreleased We are in the election campaign everything is very fast and the period is worrying I refer in particular to the crisis especially of an economic nature My personal opinion is that today we must demonstrate more than ever our seriousness and our sense of responsibility by converting an important decree- law which is worth over 17 billion euros The Lega Group has worked on improving issues left unresolved by the decree with the submission of amendments and trying to share common themes with the other groups We have strongly proposed solutions to the problems of superbonus 110 In particular mediation has enabled us to reach agreement on the amendment on joint responsibility which is the crucial issue that has blocked the transfer of tax credit to households and businesses At least this problem will be resolved here in this House Our amendments accepted in the Commission contain simplification measures in the area of exceptional transport and installation of photovoltaic systems as well as provisions in favour of the municipalities Of course much remained outside the decree I am thinking in particular of the issue of drought which could be addressed here However I hope that the appeal on the agenda on which the Government has committed itself will be accepted in the next aid decree Let us return to Parliament 's responsibility in converting the decree which let us not forget contains measures which are certainly inadequate but necessary I would like to point out that this measure extended the 30 cent discount on fuel excise duties to 20 September It will be little but who this summer has been in countries like Spain and France has been surprised positively that there the fuels cost and cost just 30 cents more than Italy In addition the cancellation of the system charges on household bills was extended to the fourth quarter Also in this case it may be a small measure in the sense that we know very well that the household bills have increased enormously but if you do not convert this decree also decays this measure that still goes to help the families The social bonus for electricity and gas has also been strengthened even though we have learned what we know For this reason my appeal to Parliament is always to be concrete going to see the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulations that are adopted here In the real world this measure faces great difficulties because families have problems obtaining it because of the ISEE communication mechanism paradoxically in fact it is automatic only for citizens income recipients while families have great difficulty getting this bonus The possibility for companies to provide corporate benefits of up to 600 euros has also been raised This is good because wages and salaries are losing purchasing power very quickly Our idea which I also expressed in an amendment that I proposed is to be able to combat inflation and to act accordingly on the tax wedge giving the employer the opportunity to provide tax free increases I mean that when a company spends 100 euros on an increase it is impossible for the worker to receive about 40 euros in the paycheck So you have to think about taxing what you want to give the worker extra They are all measures that can be improved but we can not do without them With another amendment we had asked to give a further possibility of remission of the deferred payment of the maxirate at the end of July of the scrap-b We have also proposed to eliminate the deadline of 30 September as regards the superbonus 110 on the villas These are all measures which the next so called aid b measure should take into account I would just like to end by saying that it takes a great deal of sense of reality at the moment with respect for families and businesses that really see inflation rampant The government must therefore find solutions to this situation which I would venture to call dramatic In conclusion I would like to thank all my colleagues offices Commissions 5a and 6a and their respective Presidents for the great work they have done over the years
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen representative of the Government we are debating and approving three important acts relating to the relationship between our country and the European institutions Allow me as an introduction to reiterate that as is also certified by the results of the work of the Conference on the future of the Union people have a strong feeling of distance from the European institutions The lack of representativeness of national parliaments and the lack of involvement of national parliaments in the European decision making process leads to apathy among voters which is reflected in abstention and then in disinterest in what is happening in Brussels but not only Given that the impact of decisions taken in Europe on our future and on our industrial and employment systems is becoming increasingly apparent and I quote for example the approval of the various plans for ecological transition and the declared objectives of climate neutrality it is essential to draw proper attention to discussions such as today's In this regard I would like to stress that Italy must be more incisive in the ascending phase practically as the countries of Northern Europe did when they pushed to impose disposable cellulose as opposed to plastic of which we are the first producers at European level but also excluding bioplastics On the basis of the European delegation law I would like to stress the commitment made by the Government and I thank you on a subject which is very dear to me through the approval in the Commission of an agenda of the League at my first signature This is the commitment to create an independent national institution for the protection and promotion of human rights through the establishment of a specific body with the aim of protecting the fundamental rights recognised by the Italian Constitution and by the international conventions to which Italy is a party It is a body that is able to work in close collaboration with international bodies responsible for the protection of human rights and with other counterparts established by other States thus increasing the capacity for diplomatic cooperation of our country a body that is able to make continuous contact with civil society and with non-governmental organisations associations foundations and the realities of volunteering It is important that this body should have among its aims to monitor respect for human rights in Italy with a view to preventing possible violations to monitor respect for the freedom and dignity of persons with particular attention to women and children in digital society to verify and promote the effective implementation on national territory of international human rights conventions and agreements ratified by Italy to receive and evaluate reports of violations or limitations including violations perpetrated on the Internet to draw up recommendations and opinions to be sent to the Government and the Chambers on issues related to respect for human rights to promote the culture and teaching of these digital education as well as the dissemination of knowledge of protection tools including through information initiatives and awareness raising of the public Mr President I am sorry but there is too much chaos Article 10 which delegates to the Government the adaptation to the regulation on official controls on organic production and labelling as well as the transversality of these controls which cover the whole agri -food chain from food to animal feed How can we fail to stress the European abomination of nutrition score and the need to fight Italian soiling in any way Very important article 15 it is never as important as today to check that terrorist content is not disseminated on the web It is certain however that terrorism does not only travel online on the contrary Surely the continuous landing of illegal immigrants on our coasts does not help to prevent any acts of terrorism in Europe demonstration of this is the fact that several perpetrators of attacks had landed illegally in our country and had stayed there Minister Lamorgese 26,652 landings in six months are too many if you will understand Even if only 0.01 percent of the illegals were a terrorist the damage would be from our point of view irreparable Turning to the important document on Italian participation in the European Union in 2022 I would like to highlight the excellent work done in the Commission which has allowed us to reach the approval of an important report that balances well the wishes expressed by the European plans with the economic working and industrial interests of our country especially with regard to environmental issues I would like to focus on a passage which is particularly close to my heart and which I have emphasized in other speeches on the development of infrastructure In the document we see the desire to propose our country as a new hub for energy supply moving the centre of gravity of European energy policies to the south and expanding our network of relations with the Mediterranean countries Making Italy a platform of this magnitude requires interventions and development of infrastructure networks and consequently we need to change some attitudes that we have witnessed in recent years by some political leaders The opposition to any form of investment on the territory that concerned the creation and development of new infrastructures often disguised by instrumental environmental claims has prevented our country from being in step with the main world economies Therefore it is important to return to the discussion of the trans European transport network programme TEN T and I am pleased to read in the document approved in the Commission the desire to resume this speech especially with regard to infrastructures which have a strategic impact on our territory The policies of no to everything as evidenced by the serious energy crisis that we are experiencing have not held up the confrontation with history We reverse this trend we focus on the development of infrastructures that can make our country integrated with the European economic fabric and we imagine together an Italy that invests in development and looks to the future"
FAZZOLARI FdI Mr President with the law of European delegation we are voting in fact on a number of acts first of all the customary delegation to the Government to adapt the Italian system to the European one It is the so called law that Europe asks for but it would also be an opportunity to tidy up some points one of which Brothers of Italy has tried concerns the resolution of the misunderstanding of the incorrect interpretation in Italy of the Bolkestein directive On bathing concessions it was clear and clear that even in the case of concessions of public property goods a directive aimed at the granting of services does not apply The law of European delegation was precisely an opportunity to clarify and resolve this misunderstanding It is regrettable that this Parliament and the Government have decided to pretend nothing once again confirming that the European hat is more and more a valid pretext for making Italians pass and digest all those rules for which the Government does not want to take responsibility for choice and gives it to Europe it is the fault of Europe No it 's the government 's fault on the bathing concessions In addition to the final report the very important document is the programmatic report in which the government basically explains how it wants to be in Europe in the coming months and what it would like to do in the context of the European Union However we find ourselves systematically with completely empty documents without any content without any vision Let me say that the motion for a majority resolution is very sorry I wonder if the so called government of the best or the majority of the best in which they are all the best can put forward a motion for a resolution stating something like this we have read the document that 's fine but next time maybe show us before so at least we study it I wonder if it was not appropriate to give an address that someone would say something in short even proforma Brothers of Italy presented its resolution a little more contentful Of course if we had to talk about Europe we could have written manuals Very concretely really can we say that the line of Italy in the European Union is to say that everything is fine we keep this course and put in our documents some attention to the contour We say no it 's not okay This model of European integration is not working and is creating serious problems Every time facts and history knock on the door of European bureaucrats trying to explain to them that there is something that should be changed Brothers of Italy as we know is part of the family of European conservatives We have the privilege of having Giorgia Meloni president of the Party of European Conservatives and Reformists and we have always done a very clear battle on what the line of integration for the continent should be By now the European narrative has focused the story as if there were two positions the Europeanists or if we want the most Europeanists those who would like to continue on this path and those who would like to destroy Europe This is a lie which does not reflect the history of European integration in which confederal thinking has always had full citizenship which is precisely what characterizes conservative thinking in Europe that is to say that states must maintain their sovereignty as regards the legislation of proximity that is that it concerns the daily life of their citizens and their businesses whereas the Union must instead address the great challenges of history that every single European State cannot face alone This seems like a vision of common sense and we did n't make it up so much so that characters far more illustrious than we have explained it very well in the past from De Gaulle to Churchill and many others Then the facts come to confirm that the current model of European integration does not work first the economic crises from 2008 onwards to bear witness that Europe was not ready then the pandemic in which we realized that uncontrolled globalisation that the European Union did not master had created value chains so long that Europe did not have the supply of the elements essential to its survival In fact we discovered with the pandemic that all the active ingredients of our medicines even if bearing the brand of a European country are mainly produced in India and we wake up realizing that we are fragile Then came the war which showed us a further fragility the energy fragility and even there we woke up late Maybe we will find a different opportunity to explain it better but really someone can believe that this situation at our borders is not closely linked to the standing that Germany has chosen for the European Union with a system now of the European Union that provides for the supply of cheap raw materials from Russia cheap labour from Eastern Europe added value created by the German industries that invade Western and global markets Of course there is a situation of instability in which you make the Russian supply vital for you and so Russia believes that it is in the right to exercise a will of power over its neighbours but this is a complex speech that perhaps deserved a discussion these days instead of the desolation we have seen Always with a model that we pretend works the European Union becomes a sort of entity that sticks the Member States but with little impartiality The examples would be endless but in these days two come to mind The first concerns the situation with regard to immigration How many times have we heard Poland and the Visegrad countries attack how inhuman they are towards immigration We have also seen this recently despite the fact that they have welcomed Ukrainian refugees as true Europeans on their land All this however clashes with the silence that we have heard in recent days regarding what happened in Melilla 23 deaths among migrants trying to cross the border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla The government is socialist and there has been the total silence of the European institutions and the total silence of this House What would have happened if 23 people had died on the border with Poland Instead the President of the European Council Michel has declared full support for Spain for the protection of European borders These are the double standards that characterise the European Union A second example is France which denies the extradition of ten terrorists of the red brigades in Italy and does so these are the anticipations because the right trial is not guaranteed in Italy France therefore states that in Italy the right trial is not guaranteed and therefore does not allow the extradition of terrorists Imagine what would have happened if the Czech Republic for example had not extradited ten terrorists to Germany I wonder if this would have been accepted in the same way I hope that this House will remember this French attitude on Tuesday when the ratification of the Quirinale Treaty between France and Italy comes to this House This model of the European Union is not ours for us Europe is a historic reality made up of people who have the same roots and culture and who have the same destiny not an exclusive club in which you choose who can and who does not
FAZZOLARI FdI Mr President I would like to call this House to a principle of reality because it can be useful for those who make laws We have the little problem that the government of the best president Senator this is not the content of the agenda FAZZOLARI FdI Why not PRESIDENT The debate is closed There 's no vote so you can't talk about it Senator FAZZOLARI FdI What does that mean Ca n't I talk about an amendment PRESIDENT The debate is closed There is no longer an amendment If we go on like this the children grow up and there will be no more need for pediatric measures because they will have reached a certain height
FAZZOLARI FdI Mr President there is a 95 majority in this House and 5 in opposition perhaps a bit of flexibility to make the opposition say a few words is not exactly a violation of the Rules of Procedure We have a situation that calls grotesque is to say little We have the obligation of FFP2 mask for children but the FFP2 mask for children does not exist It is not a matter of size because the child is not a miniature human being but has a different conformation Any uncertified medical care for children is not suitable for children it is not that since it has been certified for an adult we make it small and becomes for children Now the question is this can the Italian Parliament introduce the obligation of a mask if that mask does not exist The answer should be clear to everyone Yet it is not The answer is no yet there is an obligation to mask even if the mask does not exist In the face of such a grotesque thing Parliament should rebel And in fact even the majority who support the Government of the best at a certain point had a whisper of dignity and doubt can we go on with the obligation of a mask that does not exist Then they gathered ten minutes made two calculations and decided that yes you can establish the obligation of a mask that does not exist Now the principle of reality that what one sees and lives is superior to what one hopes within his own ideologies is at the basis of human behavior and even more so at the basis of Western politics But we have now come to esotericism which has replaced science The Italian Parliament imposes an obligation on things that do not exist an obligation to mask but the mask does not exist It is the same that we saw with the obligation of an outdoor mask it is the greatest scientific idiocy that ever existed The virus in the open air and in the sun dies but the government of the best with the CTS of the best with the paid scientists has decided the obligation to mask outdoors Like the green pass to go and buy socks if you do n't have government authorization you can't go and buy socks you can't go and buy a book you can't go and buy the baby 's toy because the government decided it was the best The same that imposes the obligation of a mask that does not exist The truth is that this government which does not exist is a government that has replaced logic with ideology and science with esotericism We 'll always be against these clowns
"President Draghi the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin recently declared that Russia wants to take back the territories that belong to it and return to its historical borders This means not only all the borders of the Soviet Union i.e. Ukraine Moldova the Baltic States and Georgia but if we know history also the Tsarist borders including Finland and part of Poland including Warsaw It is clear that Finland has been concerned and asks to join NATO and that Eastern Europe too is concerned because Putin has stated that he has aims on it Our concerns however do not end here because the Russian institutions have finally explained what they intend to denazize Ukraine They explained to us that Ukraine does not exist there is no Ukrainian nation there is no Ukrainian people there is no Ukrainian language But Nazi propaganda from 1990 onwards has created an anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalism and therefore now Russia with its special operation must re-educate the Ukrainians and make them understand that they do not exist and that they are Russian Now to us who are Westerners this seems absurd but to those who have grown up in communist regimes and are very familiar with rehabilitation centers all this seems normal and goes in that direction I am sorry to have to waste minutes to eliminate some fake news that runs on our media but unfortunately also within Parliament The war would be waged to stop the genocide in Donbass this is a Russian fake news repeated in Italy and also in Parliament Beyond the matter that the Donbass is not Russian because given to the hand 40 percent of the Donbass is inhabited by Russians the official numbers are the following and I challenge the Italian who usually watches our television to have this perception the civilian deaths in Donbass in 2021 were 25 in 2020 the civilian deaths were 26 in 2019 they were 27 So no genocide in progress and no genocide to stop Where do the 14,000 deaths we hear about come from These are mainly Ukrainian and pro-Russian fighters involved in the Russian invasion of the Donbass in a scheme we know and which Russia systematically repeats that is creating conflict zones in the states it claims it applies to Transnistria in Moldova Abkhazia South Ossetia in Georgia Donbass in Ukraine Russia simply wants domination over the territories it claims including Ukraine The problem is that the other states do not agree with Russia they disagree because Russia is not an attractive state Russia is a poor state and has a lower GDP than Italy despite having 145 million inhabitants It is a country that produces nothing and exports only raw materials like a third world country It is a country with huge income disparities with enormous corruption where Putin and his hierarchies show a billionaire wealth that is not well known where it comes from while 20 million Russians do not even have a bath in the house This is Russia and it is no wonder that Ukraine like the rest of Eastern Europe looks to the West and not to Russia But Russia instead of wondering why decides to intervene with tanks Luckily Ukraine resisted this invasion which according to any military analyst was to last a few days Russia has invaded Ukraine and Ukraine has amazed the world with a resistance that has never been seen before without the weapons it needs Also this lie repeated by certain journalists I do not know whether because paid by the Kremlin or because in bad faith and by certain political forces according to which Ukraine has already been sufficiently armed is denied by military analysts The Ukrainians fight with a piece of artillery every wind in possession of the Russians and with less range and less fire capacity Resistance is only due to the heroism of that people Ukraine is experiencing its Risorgimento fighting for its freedom and independence And we Italians that the Risorgimento lived it and that we transformed what others called only a geographical expression in our homeland should have an empathy towards that people and its Risorgimento But political choices are made not with empathy but with reason And the reason why we must support Ukraine has already explained to us the president of Fratelli d'Italia Giorgia Meloni and it is very simple because there lies the Italian national interest First Putin 's statements are already very clear if Ukraine capitulates quickly then it will be up to other European countries and to us as Brothers of Italy would not like the return of Soviet imperialism even in the third millennium Secondly very pragmatically it is not Italy that decides the fate of the war in Ukraine there is a surreal debate as if the Italian weapons were fundamental to decide whether Ukraine can resist or not Well even if Italy were to betray its international alliances the United Kingdom the United States Australia Japan all the rest of the West would continue to defend Ukraine It would not change therefore the fate of the war but would change the image and credibility of Italy in the world making it fall back into that image of a country that is not reliable as it has often been painted Brothers of Italy is the movement of Italian patriots we make our decisions always and only in the interest of the nation This today means respecting our international alliances as must always make a great nation like ours"
Minister thank you for being here We as a force of patriotic opposition will not make presumptuous attacks today but we will try to make our contribution Thank you very much if you will listen carefully to me despite the desolation of an empty Chamber when we talk about issues such as these as a witness to a West which is inadequate to meet certain challenges First of all I want to represent my personal closeness and that of Brothers of Italy to the many Ukrainians and Russians who live in Italy and who at this moment live with great apprehension what is happening regardless of the responsibilities of its Governments A thank you goes to our diplomats and our officials in Kiev and a thank you to you Minister for leaving the embassy open it is an important sign of presence which repeats itself after what has already been given in Afghanistan and which gives lustre to our nation With all due respect however I must say that we would have preferred a more experienced foreign minister to face a crisis like this You said that you had been confronted with Minister Lavrov a diplomat since before you were born a person of enormous depth You are an intelligent and prepared person and you will agree with me that in a context like that maybe a Third Giulio Di Sant Agata or Ambassador Vattani or others with the same standing as Lavrov would have been more appropriate Unfortunately the government of the best beyond the name it has given itself has chosen its boxes according to other logics and then we pay it in contexts like this Italy arrives unprepared and even worse the European Union arrives unprepared once again bureaucratic giant geopolitical nano and internationally What happens in Ukraine is also a child of European weakness In this context clarity is important and then I want to say straightaway that the Brothers of Italy supports an Italy fully part of the Western bloc fully part of the Atlantic Alliance without ambiguity Ours is not a tactical choice or a choice of convenience it is the awareness of being part of a Western world with common roots common philosophical visions son of the classical and Christian roots of Europe which belong to Europe and to all countries of European culture This is our belonging to the West We have never looked at China the Islamic monarchies of the Gulf Russia our choice of field is clear and clear In the same way we have always supported respect for international law aware that it is the only instrument to prevent the outbreak of wars and conflicts and also for a reason of opportunity international law defends the least powerful States and unfortunately for a long time Italy and Europe are not among the superpowers of this planet Therefore all the more so Italy and Europe must forcefully and always uphold international law We were however easy prophets when on the occasion of the war in Serbia for Kosovo we said that we were creating a dangerous precedent Solving a crisis although very serious and bloody by redesigning the borders of one European State would have been a precedent used by others in Europe And that is exactly what Russia is doing quoting the Kosovo case when it comes to redesigning borders to resolve an armed conflict situation With the same clarity however we are wondering whether NATO and the West have made the most appropriate progress so far If we have arrived from the 2002 Maritime Practice Agreement with a proximity between NATO and Russia to a war situation at our doorstep something has been wrong It 's a fact The goal according to Brothers of Italy but I believe it is a goal shared by all Europeans is to achieve a definitive peace between Europe and Russia for a number of reasons In order to achieve this ambitious objective we must be able to reconcile two very different needs on the one hand the needs of the Eastern European countries rightly concerned by Russian imperialism which they have known over and over again in history and last but not least freed themselves from the Soviet yoke only in 1990 From a historical point of view it means yesterday It is clear therefore that these countries are worried and frightened We should remember the debt we owe to the countries of the East which we have given to the communist dictatorship in exchange for our freedom when with too much simplicity we attack Poland Hungary and the Visegrad bloc If they are lagging behind in democracy perhaps it is because we have handed them over to the Soviet bloc for half a century It is an even more important speech for Ukraine Putin has made a long historical reconstruction partly true of the proximity between the two peoples He however failed to remember a historical event Mr. Minister if you listen to me maybe it 's more useful to all of us
"FAZZOLARI FdI And we are very happy with the Presidency 's firm vigilance Putin has made a long historical reconstruction partly true of the relations between Russia and Ukraine of the relations between two very similar peoples He however failed to mention the painful parenthesis of the relationship between these two peoples first of all that of the Ukrainian genocide the holodomor the genocide by hunger that Soviet communists imposed on Ukraine in the 1930s to bend it to the new Bolshevik model This too must be remembered when we talk about Russia and Ukraine On the other hand however there is a superpower calling for guarantees on its own safety In this respect unfortunately we have given rise to Russian concerns We won the Cold War thanks to Reagan 's space shield which was partly a bluff but which worked We were able to strike the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union was unable to strike the West This led to an arms race by the Soviet Union which the Soviet economy did not hold and therefore suffered a collapse precisely because of the space shield announced by Reagan Today we want to do more We want to be able to have a NATO structure that makes Russia offensive that is that we can hit its vital cities before Russia has the time to react Now we are not referees in this game we are biased We won two to zero the Cold War If we can win six to zero we 're happy eight to zero ten to zero we agree as long as we do n't do two to two and lose two to three and that 's our concern Are we sure we can make an offensive power that has 6,500 atomic warheads and 145 million inhabitants which is the largest state in the world from a geographical point of view If we 're sure fine We are not so sure for a number of reasons firstly it is the power of Russia as we have already said secondly Russia has already given signs that it was not prepared for certain concessions He did so in Georgia with a situation very similar to that of Ukraine Georgia in the process of joining NATO was militarily occupied by Russia and the West did not react The third most serious reason was the sign of weakness of the West and in particular of the Biden administration Let 's talk about numbers Minister which if we reason together may be useful perhaps even in some international conversation Biden has announced to its public opinion and to the whole world that 3,000 American deaths in 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan were a cost in terms of lives too high to bear so much so that it led to a disorderly and shameful withdrawal from Afghanistan I repeat 3,000 dead in 20 years The Ukrainians in a war defined at low intensity in a few years had 14,000 deaths in the Donbass these are the relationships All experts estimate that any earthly conflict even with conventional weapons would lead to tens of thousands of deaths in a matter of days So how does the West at the same time say that it is not willing to bear a cost of 3,000 deaths in twenty years and make it believe that it would be willing to have 50,000 deaths in a few days That 's how we exposed ourselves to the Russian reaction with an incompetent American administration We have to have the strength to say it With Trump it would n't have happened and I do n't say it but many people in the United States say it today Trump would n't lend his side to this weakness Let 's talk about the Americans who are the ones who always do much of the work for the West And if we want to talk about the West we 're even worse off A Europe impoverished by the Covid which imposes the obligation of vaccination and to walk around with masks and with the green pass with what credibility does it talk about war Do you go to the front with the FFP2 and respect the social gap Let 's be credible On the front line and with the green pass of course we then lend our support to those who think they can bully the West In this context Europe is always inadequate Minister I ask you to officially protest on behalf of Italy with Borrell responsible for European foreign policy who is allowed to make idiots tweets saying that with sanctions no shopping in Milan for the Russians People are dying there people are fighting there and we have a clown who says no shopping in Milan Is this the reaction of the West I ask you to make Italy 's voice heard When Europe speaks of a dramatic situation it does so seriously PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator of course the names must be contained FAZZOLARI FdI You 're the president"
FAZZOLARI FdI If you bothered to find out about the history of our Group you would know that we are not afraid of the responsibility of saying pagliaccio to someone Speaking of inadequate management of certain contexts Minister Di Maio in 2019 I submitted a parliamentary question addressed to you because it included Ukraine among the safe states of origin of illegal immigrants This means that the Ukrainian person found without a residence permit could be taken and sent back home because the country was safe while there was a war I asked her how it was possible for the Ukrainian carer without a residence permit to be sent back to Ukraine where there was war and she did not include Pakistan Egypt Nigeria Ivory Coast Bangladesh where there are no wars Well let us try to live our eastern borders even more seriously if there is war in Ukraine Ukraine is not a safe country or in Ukraine there is no war and then it is a safe country but it cannot say the two things at the same time I therefore ask you on the other hand to remove Ukraine from the list of safe countries in order to avoid repatriating Ukrainian caregivers and perhaps including Pakistan so that we can return those who illegally land on our coasts without having any title In conclusion it is right to make every effort to work for peace Europe has few weapons at its disposal including sanctions if the sanctions hit Russia more than they hit us otherwise they become mockery for everyone first of all for the Ukrainians and for those who support that situation Moreover support for Eastern European countries once again threatened by Russian imperialism just with the alleged attacks on the Visegrad blockade condemnation of the violation of international law by Russia for the recognition of the separatist Republics of the Donbass a plan of energy autonomy of the European Union because we can talk about what we want about bad Russia but then from Russia we have to buy gas otherwise we turn off the light in our homes And above all we must respect the commitment of the parameter of 2 of NATO 's military spending we continue to speak of the Atlantic Alliance and of NATO membership but Brothers of Italy is the only party that has always paid the electoral cost and of unpopularity to say that it is not spared on military spending that freedom has a cost and that cost is the ability of a people to defend themselves There is the 2 of GDP parameter for each NATO Member State which Italy continues to systematically fail to respect And precisely because of a situation of tension we ask at least that already in the next financial law we expect to respect the parameter of 2 of GDP As true Europeans we care about this Europe We have at heart the peace and the borders of Europe once again endangered by the inadequacy of this European Union Once again the Confederal model supported by the European Conservatives chaired by Giorgia Meloni namely a model with a Europe that collaborates on foreign policy defence border defence and faces the great challenges of our time is the path we must pursue
Balboni FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen Brothers of Italy will vote in favour of the Junta 's proposal because we fully support it The judge for the preliminary investigation of Turin clearly violated not only the law but the Constitution so the Senate cannot remain indifferent to such a serious fact A magistrate of the Republic who has the task of enforcing the law violates it publicly A student from the first year of law would also be able to read and interpret correctly Article 6 2 of Law No 140 of 2003 which applies Article 68 of the Constitution This article states that the judicial authority where it intends to use in relation to the Member in this case who was a Member of Parliament at the time interceptions made on third party telephone users must address the request to the Chamber to which the Member of Parliament belongs or belonged at the time when the conversations or communications were intercepted That seems to me to be a very clear and unequivocal provision What did the judge do for the preliminary investigation in Turin instead First in the face of the exception of defence it was reserved to decide then as the rapporteur pointed out earlier it did not decide on this exception except that it would still have the right to decide on its own initiative He did not decide of his own motion and did not decide at the request of the defence but in the decree ordering the judgment he considered these interceptions as a source of proof on which to base the referral to trial A blatant violation of the law and the Constitution against which it is right that the Senate today decides to raise the conflict of attribution still remaining that when the Constitutional Court has inevitably annulled this act so abnormal then it will be our task it will be the task of the Junta first and then of the Assembly to assess whether or not these interceptions cover that character of occasionality on the basis of which as we know it will be possible or not to declare them usable This is an exclusive prerogative of the Senate and no judge of the Republic can afford to trample on it
Mr President ladies and gentlemen the Brothers of Italy Group has submitted the question for a preliminary ruling in order to request that the articles of the draft law in question be not examined If the law and in particular Article 24 of the Civil Protection Code provides that the state of emergency must have a maximum duration of 12 months prorogable in extraordinary and exceptional cases for a further 12 months there will be a reason Moreover the legislator has set quite wide limits because I remind everyone this rule is from 2018 and previously the maximum time limit was three months then extended to six months and finally in 2018 to twelve plus twelve months The state of emergency as the word itself says has a meaning to cope with unpredictable and exceptional situations With the decree law that today we are called to convert the Government after an innumerable series of similar measures it has actually normalized the emergency The state of emergency is however an extremely serious measure that compresses fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution including freedom of movement and enterprise Precisely because these are constitutional principles these can reasonably be compressed only in a comparative judgment before precisely exceptional situations Unfortunately the pandemic lasted for many months also because of the inability of the government to face it with appropriate measures because it has focused everything and only on the vaccine And we have forgotten the home and timely care we have forgotten those preventive measures that we of Brothers of Italy have constantly asked unheard to secure transport to make the FFP2 mask compulsory in crowded places in means of transport in metropolitans and especially on regional trains ventilation in schools We have been asking for this for months and only in the last period at last have you begun to agree with us hypocritically pretending to ignore from those who came such proposals for too long unheard
Please Senator Balboni continue Balboni FdI Thank you very much Mr President But as we know the voice of the only opposition in this House is now seen as an annoyance and I believe that all our colleagues from the far left to the right are demonstrating this we are an annoyance and I apologize if we continue to insist on believing in democracy I apologize if we continue to believe that this House should also be a place of confrontation between different opinions but this is the role that we have carved out and I think that if you do not listen to us the Italians will listen to us To continue my speech I wonder what is the point of continuing with the emergency with more than 90 of vaccinees and if we consider the cured we reach 95 of the immunized population What sense does it have as you do with this decree law to continue to clutter rules on increasingly confused increasingly contradictory increasingly complicated norms It will take a hundred page manual now for every citizen to know how he can go shopping how he can go to the cinema or theater travel on the means of transport and exercise the minimum constitutional freedoms that should always be guaranteed to him The vaccination obligation for all citizens over fifty years of age even for those who live in the countryside for the couple of pensioners who legitimately choose not to have social contacts for a farmer who works outdoors or for a family business where there are only parents and children and not strangers is one of the absolutely unreasonable rules standards that all over Europe and the world are now starting to cancel and that you want to repeat instead Take care this is not only a problem of constitutional freedom but also of economics because tourism in Italy is worth or perhaps it was worth 13 14 15 percent of GDP and now throughout Europe and the world are planning Easter and summer holidays Then I put myself in the role of a tourist who comes from abroad and reads that in Italy there is still the state of emergency and needs the super green pass to do the shopping to be able to move and to enter the restaurants and then the super green pass and the negative buffer This afternoon a negative buffer will also have to be presented in order to enter this House but how Mr Draghi did n't you say that with the green pass there was absolute security to be safe to be safe So what 's the point of swabming if you 're safe with the super green pass In order to enter this House today we will have to present a negative buffer done even on the same day This means that perhaps we were right listening to those experts who told us that the vaccine does not prevent the circulation of the virus that you can get infected and be infected even if you have the third dose and unfortunately as demonstrated by the dramatic situation of Israel even if you have the fourth dose It made sense then to ask for all the measures we did not listen to and on which only today you finally began to reason We are giving a message to tourists all over the world inviting them to go to Spain where they can do what they want or to England where they can do the same either in Greece or everywhere but not in Italy You are creating the condition of killing for the third consecutive year one of the main factors of development and gross domestic product which is Italian tourism That is why ladies and gentlemen we have tabled the question for a preliminary ruling By now you have all joined the politically correct You 've all accepted the religion of the green pass It is no longer a question of pragmatic reasoning about what is useful and what is not It is no longer a question of balancing the various interests that are also in the field because there is certainly an interest in health we are the first to say that health must be absolutely protected but there is also an interest in the economy Today the whole world is trying to get out of this dilemma to ensure that economic recovery is absolutely necessary And instead you continue with this religion for which it is no longer possible to discuss the matter Dear President let me conclude with one consideration it is truly scandalous that the children or rather the daughters of two political leaders Giorgia Meloni and Matteo Salvini have entered into the debate these days Priests of the politically correct religion are not ashamed either of dragging into political controversy an individual choice of parents who together with doctors and pediatricians are free to choose without becoming the subject of political debate or worse And I 'm also referring to PD colleagues like Senator Marcucci who should be ashamed
Balboni FdI I shall conclude Mr President It has turned into a political lynching a choice of two free and conscious parents among other things made by more than two thirds of all Italian parents These are the reasons why we ask not to pass to the examination of the bill of conversion to our examination
Balboni FdI Mr President the Senate Assembly is about to finally adopt a wrong regressive certainly useless Senator Renzi but also harmful if you will allow me Italian justice in fact and the vast majority of Italian magistrates who love their work and perform the high function they are called with great commitment and professionalism deserved much more This law does n't even affect the power of currents in the CSM In fact it introduces an electoral system that enhances their contractual power and makes them even stronger The only way to cut at the root this shameful degeneration of the albeit legitimate and proper democratic pluralism which demeans all the honest magistrates and disconcerts all the Italians would be the temperate draw as honestly recognized by lawyers distinguished and free as Nordio and Gratteri and as proposed also by Brothers of Italy with our amendments obviously all rejected by a deaf and indifferent Chamber Moreover a Parliament that cuts 37 of its members in the name of savings and at the same time increases the members of the MSC by 25 in addition to having more than doubled the staff that can be hired with collaboration contracts demonstrates all its subdiction to the power of those same currents which in words and only in words someone who then withdraws the amendments in this House says he wants to fight This law of yours moreover hardly touches on the controversial phenomenon of the so called revolving doors between the judiciary and politics ignoring that when a magistrate is running for election and the same reasoning applies even when he assumes positions of government that are political in nature he is forever stripped of impartiality which is the very essence of his high function regardless of whether he is then elected or not Those who take sides with a party dear Minister must no longer return to judicial functions if you really care about the good reputation of the judiciary This is the view of the citizens who are entitled to be judged by a judge not only impartial but who also appears to be so as Caesar 's wife Of course you have also rejected all our amendments on this point This law of yours does not even address the issue of out of role magistrates which today are as many as 200 in addition to 20 administrative magistrates limiting itself to a general and indeterminate commitment to their downsizing in the implementation of the delegation but without saying whether this downsizing must be one percent 2 10 or 50 Of course our amendment proposing to indicate this reduction at least to the extent of 50 was also rejected But does it seem normal to you ladies and gentlemen that all the leadership of the Ministry of Justice should be held by judges who are out of office with one exception which in fact confirms the rule You did not even want to remedy the scandalous privilege of the double salary that the off duty magistrates receive which continue to perceive the substantial emolument as a magistrate adding it to the allowance for the function they perform out of role as if it were an annuity On this too all the amendments which aimed to put an end to it were rejected In this law less than any other privilege is addressed than to define feudal in nature is the minimum I refer to the privilege of substantial immunity which in violation of Article 28 of the Constitution the law on the responsibility of the magistrates guarantees the magistrates that by their wrong and negligent acts and decisions with guilt and malice they cause damage to the citizens It is a substantial immunity a feudal privilege I repeat because in democracy everyone should respond to the consequences of their mistakes it is a fundamental principle of our legal system as well as a constitutional principle Dear Minister when there is someone more equal than others as George Orwell taught us in the book The Farm of Animals then there is no more democracy Re-read Article 28 of the Constitution it applies to all civil servants it does not apply to magistrates But does it seem normal to you that a magistrate who causes even a billion damages with his decision the most wrong and negligent in the world responds differently from all other citizens within six months of his salary Can a magistrate fail a company that is worth billions and responds within six gross monthly amounts of his salary Madam Minister And no one is scandalized by this But is it not written in the law that all respond to their obligations with their present and future assets It should be added to Article 2740 of the Civil Code except for the magistrates who still have a feudal privilege Too weak is also the solution adopted for the separation of functions between pm and judges Keeping a single passage within nine years what 's the point I ask you Minister what 's the point It is an ideological choice a choice that serves to affirm the full equivalence between the prosecutor and the judge and to deny the evidence namely that the two functions meet requirements mentality mode of action mental dress and form mentis totally opposed to each other Those who judge must be impartial as our Constitution requires Not so of course who must support the accusation for reasons that are so obvious that I do not dwell on it Until the full independence of the two careers is reached it will not be possible to say according to the Brothers of Italy fully realized the principle of the right process which wants to accuse and defend on a level of absolute equality what unfortunately still does not happen today We have tried together with other groups to change the measure at least in some more striking and more obvious points where contradictions were manifest We have tried to amend and improve this legislation somewhat in those parts where it was most harmful An absolute wall impossible to argue Even there was the outrage of the PD secretary Enrico Letta who allowed himself to mark as obstruction the presentation of a few dozen amendments calling even for confidence in yesterday 's day because some groups with a few dozen amendments among other things discussed in this House in two or three hours have tried to improve this measure This is the concept of democracy of the Democratic Party which with this exit of its secretary openly manifests all its authoritarian vocation And the Democratic Party certainly has the straw tail because when we speak euphemistically of the polluted relationship between politics and the judiciary we should be a little clearer because Palamara 's interceptions speak clearly because the two books of Palamara speak clearly The theme is not the relationship between politics and the judiciary dear Minister the theme is the relationship between a particular political party which is the majority shareholder of its Government and which is called the Democratic Party and certain judiciary enslaved to that party This is the reason why today we adopt a law that is useless if not harmful and this is the reason why Brothers of Italy strongly expresses their vote against it
Mr President ladies and gentlemen we are going to examine and vote on a reform which will be completely useless for many parts or even will have the effect contrary to what is proposed in words It will therefore be a harmful reform that does not address and resolve any of the central issues that are at the heart of the debate on justice policy today and above all does not solve the serious lack of credibility that has been created because of the well known events that have involved summits of the judiciary and politics Public opinion no longer trusts the judiciary and I do not believe that this reform will reverse this trend Unfortunately now in this Parliament what we approve of one branch cannot be touched on by the other What the House approves cannot be touched by the Senate In the Committee on Justice we have examined so many valuable amendments which apart from the most politically sensitive ones in many cases helped to solve obvious technical and legal shortcomings Yet they were all rejected Mr Cucca spoke just now Brothers of Italy voted for all or almost all except perhaps one or two the amendments proposed by Mr Cucca who were certainly valuable However we cannot understand the reason why yesterday we held hours and hours of debate in the Justice Commission and then see today the withdrawal of all these amendments by not only Italy Viva also by Forza Italia and other groups From the show I wish I could but I can't Ladies and gentlemen we are here to carry out a legislative function which cannot meet the criterion of wish but I cannot In fact if you wanted there was time to do some surgical interventions in this legislation that makes water from all sides and you could have returned to the House for the third final reading The truth is that the internal balances of the majority are very precarious and always directed to the compromise to the decrease Mr Cucca referred first to the need that at least in a law on the judicial system it should not appear that someone is more equal than the others I am thinking for example of the head of the legislative office who is excluded from incompatibility while having a prominent political role compared to many other figures who on the other hand are included in the list of incompatibilitys Orwell taught us that when one is more equal than the other we are close to a dictatorship None of the problems that are most relevant to public opinion and above all to those involved in the work that are now seeing justice that is no longer able to carry out its task to the full have been tackled None of these problems have been addressed The main is the mix the contiguity the exchange of favours between politics and the judiciary Attention however when we talk about combining politics with the judiciary we use euphemism because we should be more precise and talk about commissions between the high summits of a particular political party called the Democratic Party and summits of a certain member of the judiciary because this is what we are given the interceptions that have been read and studied by all of us and the interview books the first and the second that Palamara wrote with four hands with the director Sallusti I am referring to the combination between a political party which in fact has always had this tradition Mr Pillon mentioned Gramsci about it and a certain member of the judiciary which is the arm of that political party within the judiciary Ladies and gentlemen how can one think that the problem of the overpower of the Democratic Party within the judiciary and the problem of the overpower of a certain current of the judiciary can be resolved by excluding that the magistrate applying for the MSC should collect signatures The problem is not the signatures but the votes the magistrate who goes to ask the votes if not in the current through a transversal agreement of do ut des The electoral system that in this bill is drawn paradoxically but perhaps not so much because those who wrote it are the same magistrates who are within the Ministry of Justice emphasizes and multiplies to the umpteenth power the contractual power of the currents because it institutionalizes the possibility of agreements between lists and between candidates There is a heterogeneity of the aims of course because if the aim was to remove power from the currents ladies and gentlemen with this new electoral system instead you add power to the currents We have tried in every way with our amendments which we will then talk about when we enter into the substance and discussion of the individual elements to draw a different and alternative system such as that of the draw perhaps with a draw after selection or with an election after draw there are so many solutions that we can find in order to ensure that the contractual power of the currents their overpower is removed The real question to ask however is how many really want this In fact we know very well that at a time when for example it is about all the most important offices in Italian prosecutors it is important to have a say in the appointment of a Chief Prosecutor to the Public Prosecutor of Rome Milan Naples or another of the most important prosecutors in Italy A party that has soliciting friends is certainly favored over a party that does not have soliciting friends This also explains why in some cases investigations go on in record time and in other cases investigations never really go ahead It is not with the bill that we examine and with this electoral system that the problem of the overpower of currents and politics in the judiciary is solved It is not with the solution you have adopted to put an end to the other very questionable phenomenon of revolving doors that solves the problem Ladies and gentlemen when a magistrate applies it has no relevance whether he is elected or not The moment he 's running he takes sides And at the time of the election we lose the image of impartiality that must have the judge and the citizen when he sees that he is a magistrate does not pose the problem whether he has been elected or not the problem arises knowing that the political orientation of the citizen under trial is another whether that judge is really able to undress himself of his ideology of his political belonging and to judge him serenely Lost time I 'm a lawyer and I guarantee you that many times the first question the client asks me is not whether that judge is good competent or quick in decisions whether he studies cards or does things approximateally No The first thing you ask me is if that judge is right or left Unfortunately the answer is quite easy Because even if there are some right wing judges he carefully thinks he 's far enough out of it Therefore those who take sides elected or not must not return to judicial functions this is the real turning point In this sense the amendments of Brothers of Italy go In thanking you for the time you have given me Mr President I shall conclude with one final consideration Colleagues the amount with which you can read the entire bill do you know where it is In Article 21 which raises the components of the MSM from 24 to 30 But how We have voted for a constitutional reform with which we have reduced the members of Parliament by 37.5 per cent and we raise the CSM components by a quarter Attention I am not just talking about Article 21 and the six additional components I am talking about Article 26 and I am going to talk about it better when we come to the substance of the amendments because because of the increase provided for in Article 21 it raises the contracts of continuous collaboration from the current 26 to 62 If it 's not a present to the currents tell me what it is
Balboni FdI Mr President this amendment aims to limit the excessive discretion of the Supreme Council of the judiciary through which the weight of current and ideological membership penetrates balancing the judgment and exposing the decisions of the MSC to the censorship of the administrative judge In fact it seems appropriate to make greater use of the criterion of seniority making it not residual as this rule does but at least competing with that of attitudes and merit This is not a return to the past but to take into account the experience gained on the ground together with merit and not separately from it The management of a judicial office requires not only the possession of technical baggage which is verified only through technical and theoretical tests reserved for the High School of the judiciary but also and above all ability to manage relations with all the interlocutors of the administration of justice and control of the decision making processes that only a fruitful and proven experience is able to assure With this amendment we are therefore thinking of reducing the discretionary power of appointments and further enhancing that of seniority
Mr President our amendment 3.3 concerns the issue of the exercise of the right to vote of lawyers and university professors within the judicial councils which was also put to the vote of the Italians last Sunday With our amendment we want to ensure that first and foremost university professors can also exercise the right to vote We do not understand why lawyers even if with a united vote decided by the Council of Order can exercise the right to vote when making judgements about the magistrate and cannot do so by university professors More we do not understand why the lawyer should be bound by a unitary vote i.e. a pre-set vote in another place outside the judicial council The lawyer must have the right to vote according to his conscience without having to answer to others but to his conscience as is the case in all democratic councils We do not even understand the resistance of the judiciary to this rule because in democracy we must all be subject to a judgment This corporate and medieval claim of the judiciary to be the only one able to express a judgment on itself is really out of time We do not understand why legal practitioners who walk every day in courtrooms and know perfectly well the problems of the organisation of justice the management of justice and judicial activity cannot express their vote That is why we have proposed this amendment and we ask the House to vote in favour of it because it is a principle underlying every democratic principle
Balboni FdI Mr President with Amendment 4.3 we reiterate that recruitment based solely on the knowledge learned at university is not sufficient to guarantee the competence necessary to assume such an important role as that of a magistrate According to the rule that we are about to vote the four year degree that is also that of the old system would be sufficient to participate in the contest as magistrate This would lead to the final cancellation of experiences such as that of professional schools of legal specialisation For this reason we propose that in order to participate in the Magistrate Competition we must also demonstrate that we have attended a specialization school for legal professions I would like to remind you that it is in everyone 's eyes the truly disappointing outcome of the last court competitions from which it emerges that young candidates very often lack even the elementary notions even sometimes the ability to write correctly a sentence done in Italian without errors and I say not grammar but at least syntax For this reason we believe that in order to guarantee that high level that has always distinguished our magistrates it is necessary to restore and maintain the possibility indeed the obligation to attend the specialization school
Balboni FdI Mr President with this amendment we propose that the magistrates in service cannot play a teaching and organizational role in private schools that offer preparation courses for the competition in the judiciary It is clear to us that there is a conflict of interest that a magistrate in the service should take care of teaching those who wish to take part in the magistrate 's courses We see this as an elementary principle of transparency and impartiality which I believe the House should consider positively
Balboni FdI Mr President with Amendment 4.0.2 we are introducing and then there will be a whole series of amendments which will strengthen this proposal of ours the principle that our judicial system should move towards the separation of careers Therefore in order to start taking preparatory measures in this respect with the amendment under consideration we ask that since the entry into force of this law two separate competitions be launched for access to the judiciary one for the investigative function and one for the judicial function The investigative function and the judging function meet requirements norms form mentis and mental dress absolutely distinct and distant from each other An account is the prosecutor who must seek all evidence certainly also those in favor of the suspect but every evidence and therefore represent every situation even the most unlikely in order to arrive to ascertain the truth he must basically be animated by a culture that I would call a culture of suspicion exactly the opposite of the judge Instead the judge must be as our Constitution wants absolutely impartial and must judge by having before him an accusation and a defence that have the same rights the same duties the same faculties and prerogatives And then we understand very well that a judge who judges having made the same career perhaps with his fellow prosecutor having done the contest together having played the role of judicial auditor together having a kind of mutuality and also professional connection even if not wanting he may not be able to completely undress of the culture he has acquired in his professional career even more so if maybe up to a year earlier both in another district and in another Region he played the role of prosecutor The form mentis culture and mentality of the prosecutor are absolutely incompatible with those of the judge We know well that when one acquires a mentality then even if unconsciously and unconsciously one continues to respond to it I could understand a judge going to the prosecutor 's office but never ever ever can one accept a prosecutor 's office going to be a judge It is therefore necessary to start a path of separation of the two functions and then of the two careers For this reason we support our amendment
Balboni FdI Mr President I would like to add to this amendment the signature of myself and of my group 's senators because we are talking precisely about the incongruity that I discussed in my general speech We are faced with the fact also stigmatized by Mr Cucca so there is someone more equal than the others We are talking about the incompatibility for the out of role and strangely they are all incompatible even less important figures than the head of the legislative office and the deputy head of the legislative office of a Ministry but by chance the head of the legislative office which evidently wrote this rule is not incompatible There can't be one more equal than the other in front of the law For this reason we strongly support the amendment by our colleagues Mr Pillon Mr Emanuele Pellegrini Mr Pepe and Mr Urraro We regret that similar first signed amendments by Senators Caliendo and Cucca have been withdrawn as this is an absolutely unacceptable and even unconstitutional unequal treatment because it openly violates Article 3 of the Constitution
"Balboni FdI Mr President this is perhaps one of the most sensitive issues we have discussed so far We know that under current legislation 200 magistrates as well as 20 administrative magistrates can be put out of office So 220 magistrates out of about 9,000 in service today can be put out of their role to perform apical managerial or semi- directive roles within the Ministries especially within the Ministry of Justice the Constitutional International and other bodies In article 5 which as we know is an article of delegation and is not immediately preceptive at a certain point it is said in the letter h of paragraph 1 that one of the objectives that the Government will then have to pursue with the legislative decree is to reduce the number of magistrates out of role However does it not say how much 1 2 percent 10 percent 50 percent or 100 percent No one can know It seems to me to be too broad a delegation which leaves excessive discretion to the Government which may feel that it has fulfilled this delegation even by reducing by a few units the number of magistrates out of office Ladies and gentlemen think that in the Ministry of Justice only one of all the top roles is held by an official who is not a magistrate They 're all magistrates I believe that if a young man wants to be a magistrate he studies to become a magistrate he wins the magistrate 's contest it is right that he should go to be a magistrate If you want to be a public official within the Ministry there is a special career for this The magistrates must be the magistrates also because unfortunately we live a chronic lack of the role of the judiciary If I may Mr President I would also like to explain at the same time the next amendment 5.16 because it is another case of someone who is more and more equal than others We know that there has been an important battle in the House on this subject unfortunately lost We know that the out of role magistrate adds the emoluments he perceives as a magistrate he continues to perceive them even while he is out of role to the allowances he receives for the function he is going to perform within the Ministry or the other body he adds the two incomes This is an absolutely unacceptable privilege How many times in this House have we heard the rhetoric about people who do not arrive at the end of the month rightly to rightly criticize the excesses the golden pensions the salaries of politicians And today that we have the opportunity to give a small cut and to make a moralizing action all against All opposed even those who wanted to open Parliament up like a can of tuna silent and silent against this shameful privilege Quiet and mute so that the approval of this amendment can never create some disturbance in the government and you go to vote a few months before and 100 and more that you have returned in four or five Then shut up and mute about everything even about an obvious and unacceptable injustice like this We say something very simple the magistrate who wants to go out of office it is he who decides to go chooses whether to continue to take the salary as a magistrate or whether to take the compensation provided for the role he goes to play Adding them together is really unacceptable Those who vote against this amendment in my humble opinion should in future avoid certain contradictory rhetoric even now"
Mr President now begins the examination of the articles which in theory should remedy the deplorable phenomenon of the so called revolving doors They are magistrates who are candidates for elections or who take on government roles or in any case important positions within executive bodies of political significance The amendments tabled by Brothers of Italy to this and subsequent articles all aim it is useless to go into detail at a very clear objective As I said in general debate the magistrate who decides to apply or takes positions within political bodies is in our opinion forever stripped of that role of impartiality which should ensure that all citizens subject to a judgment are treated equally When we go to court it says The law is the same for all It is clear that a magistrate who has applied and stood up even if not elected has taken on a political label and can no longer have an image of impartiality In our view whether he is elected or not he must no longer return to a judicial function he can carry out other functions within the judicial system but not a judicial one Or it can be put out of place and carry out off duty duties but I repeat it no longer has to perform judicial functions neither judges nor investigators All our amendments are aimed at this In order for the judiciary to regain credibility it is necessary to give a sign of discontinuity with regard to what has taken place to date There is no point in denying that unfortunately the scandals in which the judiciary has recently been involved have shaken public opinion so much so that all those who have to appear before a judge rather than wondering if he is one who reads the papers prepared and balanced the first thing they wonder is what political idea he has and whether they having a different idea from the judge run the risk of being discriminated against because of this opinion We therefore want to give a clean cut with the past if one has the vocation of the magistrate do so To talk about me even if I never do that as a boy I would have liked to do the contest in the judiciary and maybe I also had the skills to do it given the results I got on the bar exam but I chose to be a lawyer because I wanted to do politics Since I was a boy I had this disease and knowing that in order to make politics I should not have been in a position to be criticized I did not want to be a magistrate but a lawyer precisely because I wanted to make politics Brusio PRESIDENT The debate is closed Ladies and gentlemen please leave the House quiet so that Senator Balboni can speak I also say this to the representative of the Government Balboni FdI Mr President since these are completely different functions the magistrate must be a magistrate and the politician must be a politician If the magistrate suddenly gets electrocuted on the road to Damascus leave the judiciary and will always be able to enroll in the legal order
Balboni FdI Mr President I apologize if I disturb you My colleagues say that is enough but I think I have to do my duty if they do not want to do so then it is their problem Mr President I asked to speak in an explanation of vote on Rule 26 because having proposed an amendment to delete it as you rightly pointed out we do not vote on the amendment proposal but on the retention of the article so we will vote against this article which increases the number of co-ordinated and continuous collaboration contracts within the MSC in an excessive way It 's about that present to the currents I 've been talking about in general discussion We increase the number of members of the MSC by 20 when we voted for the reduction in the number of Members of Parliament by 37 the logic would have liked that if the issue was the containment of expenditure a corresponding reduction should also be made of the other constitutional bodies or bodies of constitutional importance as in the case of the MSM I am not saying that it would have been appropriate to make a reduction of 37.7 but perhaps a quarter or a fifth as we propose with our amendments The subject is not only the greatest cost of increasing the number of members but as anyone who reads Article 26 understands the cost of the enormous increase in the corresponding staff Today the maximum limit for external recruitment is 26 see case by case approving this article the number becomes 62 more than double So I wonder about the logic of spending containment If this is not a gift to the currents tell me what it is because I modestly cannot find another answer For these reasons I announce Brothers of Italy 's vote against Article 26
Balboni FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen allow me first of all to thank President Ostellari the rapporteur Senator Cucca and all the Members of the Commission because I am the first signatory to this bill but in fact the text is the work of the whole Commission in particular the Committee which has worked on it and which has received so many important suggestions to dismiss a text that is more important than we can believe The nautical traffic in fact in recent decades but especially in recent years has become very intense our beaches our shores our coasts our sea are frequented for many months a year by millions of bathers users diportisti not to mention of course all the commercial traffic also in exponential increase All this of course involves an increase in the risks that a motor vehicle even if it travels on the water can represent for others that are found on other motor vehicles and especially for those who are in the water I believe that we have all witnessed absolutely dangerous and imprudent behaviors we have seen very often on our beaches jet skis dinghy or outboard arrive up on the beach at full speed perhaps sometimes slaloming among bathers even among the children who bathed a few meters from the shore and unfortunately every year there are fatal accidents or even if not mortal very serious because the impact of a propeller on a person sometimes leaves signs for life and disability even very serious These are injuries that very often lead to a permanent disability even very high It was therefore necessary to fill what the rapporteur rightly pointed out as a vulnus a deficiency in our judicial system because it is obvious that the feeling of justice of all of us rebels when he sees such a different treatment of manslaughter or serious manslaughter affecting the same identical protected legal good which is the life and safety of people We do not understand why if murder or injury is caused by violating the rules of the road code we can reach even very high penalties in the presence of aggravating agents such as driving in a state of drunkenness while if we violate the rules of the navigation code we must apply a completely different discipline so even as other colleagues before me remembered in the end we reach a sentence of a few months It is news of a few days ago the sentence of the court of Temple Pausania that sentenced to eight months of imprisonment with all the benefits of law conditional suspension the driver of an outboard who killed a diver while he was fishing underwater a few meters from the shore with his signal balloon Imagine the consternation of family members children wife in the face of such a low penalty These are really unacceptable things So there was this gap to be filled Obviously we cannot say that by approving this bill we will get the result of solving immediately the danger for anyone entering the water or staying at sea because there is cultural work education and prevention to be done Exactly as for road users even those who go to sea must do a work of education and awareness Very often in fact those who go to the sea today can lead a boat up to 40 horses without any notion without knowing the rules without even knowing how to conduct that vehicle just go to the first boat and rent a boat of this kind It would be like allowing a person without a driving licence to be able to drive on the streets of our city a utilitarian even not small because the outboards today are very powerful and too often are manipulated to increase its power Clearly then there is a much broader speech to be made As the establishment of road murder has led to a significant reduction in serious serious and especially fatal accidents I am convinced that if properly advertised the establishment of nautical murder will also bring a benefit It is clear that if above all young people and young people but in any case people who have no idea of the dangers they cause by carrying a boat especially close to the shore know that instead of risking six months eight months a year with the conditional especially if they have abused alcohol or drugs with this bill if as I hope it will also be approved in the other branch of Parliament perhaps before the beginning of the bathing season they risk a few years they will inevitably be led to greater prudence and greater esteem of the actions they are doing I repeat this is a bill that I am happy to have produced as input but it is the result of all the political forces present in the Commission who have all worked together to get to this text It is important that together with this result we have also had the opportunity to take advantage of the invitation that the Court of Cassation made over a year ago to change the persecubility of road injuries at this point also nautical As the Supreme Court has said in that famous sentence it is unreasonable that there is always and in any case the persecubility of office and we have also intervened on this aspect Among other things it is a reform that was already brought forward in the delegation law that we approved a few months ago so the injuries that have not been aggravated by this reform will be prosecuted and will no longer be prosecuted automatically This will also make it easier to obtain compensation for the damage It is clear that very often to the injured to those who have suffered a injury we are talking about injury not murder instead of a penalty that then remains 99 percent of the time only written in the criminal certificate and does not go beyond the most important thing is to obtain compensation for the damage he has suffered With this change we make it even easier to make a path that leads to compensation so also as my colleague Ruspandini pointed out earlier to a greater lightening of the burden of our courts that as we know already have enough to do without overloading of further trials issues that can be resolved between the parties Mr President I should like to end by saying that I am very pleased because today I believe that politics has shown that when we want and when we know what the objective is we can all work together to achieve a result in the interests of our entire community Who knows that next summer in a few months moms bathers and children can have a little more peace in enjoying our wonderful sea
Balboni FdI Mr President we in the Fratelli d'Italia Group believe that when a recomposition is possible politics must also take a step back I think that what my colleague said just now corresponds to a real situation which is not a way of taking time which is why I believe that this House should unanimously allow some time because we know that in the courtrooms we sometimes end up deepening the gap rather than reaching a composition which is always desirable in these cases There is of course the issue of inconvenience but it is not a monopoly of anyone to give a judgment on this issue when we enter into the matter we will give a judgment regardless of the same positions of the Group belonging to the colleague who today should be judged on the issue of inconveniability I believe that common sense must always and in any case lead to a friendly and compositional solution and not to deepen the differences That is why we shall be voting in favour of the request for a short postponement
"Balboni FdI Madam President Madam Minister the situation of justice in Italy is dramatic It is not from today and it is certainly not because of its responsibility but the inefficiency and delays of justice as we all know you too have made a brief mention of it cost in economic terms Just think that if the duration of Italian justice were comparable to the European average it is estimated that this would produce 130,000 more jobs and we know how important it would be for Italy to have more opportunities for work But above all this would be an important driver for investment from abroad because we know that unfortunately the issue of justice is one of the main obstacles to investment from abroad in Italy you mentioned that too However the situation is now as dramatic as it was a year ago Minister Of course there have been difficult moments due to the emergency from Covid 19 but the situation is still the same more than 1.5 million criminal trials and more than 3.1 million pending civil trials We even have a spending on unjust detention that exceeds EUR 27 million per year a thousand people every year end up in prison as innocent people in protective custody A third of the inmates are awaiting trial We rightly complain about overcrowding in prisons but one out of every three prisoners in prison today is not a convicted person These are issues Minister which you must deal with more decisively I understand that yours is such a large majority that it contains everything and the opposite of everything and unfortunately this often and willingly brings down compromises The reforms you mentioned in your report are down Minister You are a jurist and you cannot help but realize that in order to keep everything together and the opposite of everything in the end you can find absolutely inadequate solutions You made a reference and I do n't want to subtract On the reform of the prescription you to please this and that have created a hybrid that there is only in Italy you have put together a substantial institute like the prescription up to the judgment in the first degree and then in order not to displease the 5 Stars you have invented the procedural prescription But this Minister will have an effect contrary to what you wish It is clear in fact that a judge of first instance who knows that he has for example seven and a half years to issue a judgment for fraud does not pose the problem of allowing the judge of second or third degree to conclude the trial in the time of the prescription because in appeal the prescription is no longer there there will simply be imprecedibility So on the one hand you will lengthen the times of the first degree of judgment and on the other hand you will encourage the appeal because everyone will appeal in the hope of benefiting then from the procedural prescription that is from impeccability Here is an example for which the compromise for a sort of heterogeneous purpose produces the opposite result to what you say you want to pursue The same applies in the civil process Minister you who are a jurist are well aware that putting too early foreclosures and insurmountable barriers violates the principle of contradictory because it prevents the question of the parties to be completely distorted you also know however that when two parties end up before a judge they do not have to solve just one issue matters are becoming increasingly complicated As the United Chambers Supreme Court has also pointed out foreclosures too early prevent the bringing into that process all the issues involving those parties This means that you earn three four or five months in that trial but you will often force those same parties to a second a third or a fourth trial to resolve all the events that exist between them Do you see how sometimes unfortunately not having a cohesive majority that goes all in the same direction leads to paradoxical results such as these Certainly in the reforms that we have made there are also positive aspects of course There has been talk from several parts of the family court we have supported it and there was indeed our proposal for a law in this sense to which you have drawn widely and we are happy and satisfied with this As for the criminal I think of the presumption of innocence alive God finally Finally there are criteria for referral back to court which refer not to the justification of the trial but to the reasonable prediction of conviction less bad But then unfortunately the situation of justice in Italy has resulted and leads to a fall in the confidence of the Italians in the administration of justice because there is not only an economic issue about which I have already briefly spoken but there is also a theme of feeling of justice which today is regularly trampled on There have been dramatic examples in this House unworthy of a civilized country like ours of people who after ten years and after an acquittal at first instance are condemned on the basis of the same identical evidence for which they had been acquitted and who in order to save their honour see no other way out than suicide This is also today unfortunately justice in Italy Minister you rightly said in a passage from your speech that we must rebuild the confidence of Italians in justice and then if you want to do so do so Reformed as the CSM should this electoral system of multiple preferences with decreasing weight will be the triumph of currents and not their elimination We need the draw at extreme evils extreme remedies if we want to eradicate completely the current degeneration which has emerged from the scandals that everyone is unfortunately talking about Then we must intervene upstream or downstream but we find the system we need the draw Enough with the revolving doors between the judiciary and politics and finally take the courage to get to the separation of careers Madam Minister there is a medieval privilege unworthy of a rule of law for which judges have absolute immunity I refer to the civil liability of judges We should rather talk about irresponsibility because even in the extreme case in which a magistrate gets to answer for the damages he caused with malice or gross negligence although all Italians respond with their assets from the damage they cause the magistrate only responds within the limit of six months of his salary Is n't that a shame Minister how can the Italians think of being protected if the judge is immune and enjoys a medieval privilege There would obviously be many other things to talk about such as the honorary judiciary trampled on and humiliated with an amendment that not all political forces have shared We have not shared this and the blackmail must remain in the minutes so that an honorary magistrate who submits an application for stabilisation shameful because you equalize them with the administrative staff at the time when he submits the application must renounce all claims relating to rights which have been trampled on in the ten twenty or thirty years of exercise of his profession If a private entrepreneur did it with one of his workers the next day he would be on trial for extortion and you put him in a law"
Balboni FdI We would have to talk about prisons life imprisonment and many other matters but since my time is up I would like to refer to the 25 specific points in our motion for a resolution which indicate what should be the road not of this political force but of a serious and modern state that understands that justice is fundamental for the economy but also for democracy because without a feeling of justice there is no democracy
Balboni FdI Mr President for Brothers of Italy the Constitution is sacred We are a patriotic party and you cannot love the Homeland if you do not love the fundamental law that the Italian people have given to regulate their social political economic relations and on which the high and noble civil coexistence of the Italian people is based And the Constitution respects it as a whole including Article 68 Today this House is called upon to judge whether the Florence prosecutors have respected Rule 68 or not We share the rapporteur 's conclusions and consider it out of the question that the Florence Public Prosecutor has blatantly violated Article 68 of the Italian Constitution The rule is very clear both Rule 68 and the implementing law the correspondence of a Member of Parliament cannot be seized without the permission of the House to which he belongs This is an irrefutable fact And by correspondence of course it is not just a paper letter but we must also consider all other forms of written communication that technology has made available to us whether it is messages WhatsApp whether it is e-mail letters or even the statement that the bank sends to its customer These are forms of correspondence which could not be acquired even with third parties not just with a Member of Parliament as the Florence Public Prosecutor did However if there was a need for further feedback just go and look at what the Milan Public Prosecutor did then another prosecutor of the Italian Republic towards a senator also belonging to this Assembly when the Milan Public Prosecutor in the case of Siri was confronted with correspondence between a third party and the Senator he immediately suspended his operations and asked the Senate for permission to proceed thus respecting the law and the Constitution So he did not do the Florence prosecutor who even in the face of the invitations of Senator Renzi 's lawyers also demanded to go ahead even though he was aware that he was violating the Constitution There is no doubt then that politics Parliament for the dignity of the Senate institutions and democracy because this House represents the Italian people has not only the right but as Senator Renzi rightly pointed out the duty to intervene That is why we shall vote in favour of the proposal by the rapporteur Mrs Modena and we hope that the whole House will have the courage to say that the rules must be respected especially by the judiciary also and above all by the Florence Public Prosecutor as by any other magistrate who by exercising justice in the name of the Italian people must therefore before and more than anyone else respect the fundamental law that the Italian people have given himself It is obvious as Mr Renzi has said that the matter does not concern his personal affair it does not concern the trial to which he is subject and the request for referral to trial of his person even if five judgments of the Court of Cassation on the illegality of the work of the Florence Public Prosecutor some doubt must make us come and some questions colleagues must make us ask it For example we should all question ourselves if it still makes sense to maintain a feudal privilege such as the non-responsibility of the magistrates today Of course the Constitutional Court has not admitted the referendum but this should be an incentive for Parliament to intervene on the responsibility of the judges for their actions It is not possible to maintain this privilege of feudal order I repeat so that we all respond to the damage we cause by our actions but the magistrates are not are immune are above and outside the law This is a vulnus to the democratic principle which as an Italian Parliament we should finally have the courage to put our hands on Another issue on which the story questions us and I also agree with Senator Renzi is the relationship between politics and information between democracy and information because information must always be limited to what is of public interest Looking from the hole in the lock to read what father and son write is not information and it is not even populism it is shameful demagogy towards which there is no right and there is no left but there is only those who defend freedom dignity and the right of confidentiality because even the politician outside the public sphere has the right to his confidentiality with his personal and his family just like anyone else The shame of those who look from the lock hole to sell some extra copies or to make an extra scoop is another topic on which we have to question Senator Renzi we must not only do so when they shamefully publish private letters concerning her but also when for example a journalist allows himself to ask a mother if she has or has not vaccinated her child The scandal is Madam President that no one is indignant about that question that deeply wounds the dignity of that mother or father Here we should be indignant about that question and not about the answer that that mother gave forced raped by that impertinent and inappropriate question The private sphere is private sphere and personal choices are personal choices and should not be used politically either by information or by a political opponent Do you see how many issues we should and could address today if we had the dignity and I hope this House proves to have it to say that the law is really the same for everyone starting with our Constitutional Charter
Mr President I would like to outline the agenda for the first time signed by all the members of the Fratelli d'Italia Group As has already been pointed out during the general debate this Treaty the so called Quirinale Treaty brings together agreements between Italy and France in various areas and among them in the field of justice In particular Article 4 of the Treaty which is referred to as Migratory policies justice and home affairs stipulates the joint commitment I quote to deepen cooperation between the respective judicial authorities and to ensure constant coordination in accordance with the prerogatives of the judicial authorities Well as you know on 29 June last the French judicial authority the Paris Court of Appeal decided to deny the extradition requested by Italy of ten communist terrorists refugees in France after committing very serious crimes in Italy and having left behind an endless trail of blood There was an expectation on the part of the victims and of all Italians who have not forgotten what the years of lead have meant for Italy what it meant for Italy to imperish for years and years for decades of murderous criminals who put themselves behind false political justifications while committing serious common crimes rapes murderers kidnappings in person what it meant for Italy for our homeland to go through those truly difficult years It was therefore hoped that thanks also to the commitments made by President Macron towards Italy and the arrests finally carried out in 2021 after decades of impunity in Paris we could close this tragic page of the national history of the lead years obviously through the application of justice On the other hand unfortunately many years later the Mitterrand doctrine prevailed once again which tries to justify these crimes in some way behind a false screen of their politically inspired nature Moreover from what is learned from the press and from the comments of these days it seems that the French judicial authority has even called into question referring to the European Convention on Human Rights the fact that Italy has guaranteed a fair trial for these accused Well there is no guaranteeing country as much as Italy there is no trial that respects the rights of the accused more than it does in Italy above all with regard to the humanitarian question or such claim since we also cite the precarious health conditions of some of these defendants there is no penitentiary system that guarantees endless rights to prisoners such as the Italian one It is really ridiculous to think that in France someone imagines that a prisoner in serious health in Italy does not have all the protection that humanitarian principles recognize to people in these conditions I would like to remind you that this very Government has also recognized the detention of dangerous mobsters with health conditions certainly not as serious as those that seem to concern at least one of the arrested in Paris It therefore sounds paradoxical ladies and gentlemen that on the one hand France wants to sign with Italy a commitment to greater cooperation in the field of justice and at the same time want to continue to guarantee impunity to these criminals It is clear that Italy must react in the strongest possible way to this injustice It is clear that in compliance with the judicial authority and the principle of the division of powers Italy cannot confine itself to a simple manifestation of disappointment or dissension but must firmly pose an essential issue Criminal refugees in France must not enjoy any impunity they must not enjoy any immunity Those applauses in that Chamber when the Court of Appeal of Paris read the sentence are an outrage to the entire Italian people and to the feeling of justice not only of the victims but of all Italians who believe in the Italian judicial system even with its limitations and its defects because of perfection everything is there and of perfect nothing can be considered Of course however Italy has nothing to learn in terms of guarantees from a country like France Then we will talk about what France does with regard to immigrants arriving through Ventimiglia about how France behaves towards people who would be entitled that is to humanitarian aid and who instead rejects even if they are minor For these reasons we have proposed the G100 agenda and we trust that the Government can To welcome him
Balboni FdI Mr President Mr Casini my colleague from Fratelli d'Italia was the same and I thank him for his appreciation of the arguments I thought I had put forward by presenting our agenda which was accepted by the Government which of course is greeted by the whole of the Fratelli d'Italia Group with great support However for the very reason that you pointed out earlier we will vote against this Treaty because the question is precisely what you put Mr Casini the role of France the role of Germany the role of Italy The Europe we know today was born around these three poles We are founding partners of Europe with equal dignity together with France and Germany Ladies and gentlemen the real issue that arises today on the ratification of this Treaty is precisely this what is the role that Italy is given in relation to France and Germany France and Germany have concluded an iron treaty the Treaty of Aachen with which they have undertaken to agree first among themselves the line to be taken within the European Union Italy was placed in an ancillary and subordinate position Then we of Brothers of Italy as you know colleagues Brothers of Italy always have exclusively as a point of reference first of all the national interest wonder why when Italy signs such an important Treaty with France it does not put on the mat the theme of the role that Italy must assume towards France and Germany We would have liked the subject of the Treaty of Aachen to be raised before we signed this Treaty Europe cannot walk on two legs but it must walk on three legs Italy is a founding partner of the European Union and has nothing less than France and Germany at least for our irreplaceable strategic role in the Mediterranean So why are we ratifying a treaty today that establishes our subordinate role vis-à vis France and Germany and on the contrary transforms France into the guarantor of Italy vis-à vis Germany The things that matter are decided by Germany and France after which France comes to explain what the line is It can't and does n't have to work like this Brothers of Italy understand that the subordination to France is almost in the DNA of the Democratic Party of the center left of the left wing democratic tradition of which today President Casini is interpreter and in general of the other part of the hemicycle it is enough to see the relationship that the Democratic Party has always had with Macron and with France in general There is no one among us who has the Legion of Honor I believe instead that the MPs of the Democratic Party with the Legion of Honor count to dozens between Chamber and Senate That is a difference ladies and gentlemen we do not have the Legion of Honor you do When you have to choose between national interest and good relations with France choose the second We do n't You in the face of operations such as that of Lactalis for example which bought the entire Italian food chain have had a benevolent and condescending attitude We do n't When France nationalized its shipyards to prevent Fincantieri from buying them you sketched them out We are not dear colleagues of the Democratic Party When BNP Paribas as my colleague Mrs Rauti mentioned earlier bought important Italian banks it was good for you once again Woe to the world however in case of the purchase of a French company by an Italian company in this case the barricades were raised because the French their national interest can do it very well We should learn from them as well as from Germany of course The same story Stellantis ended as it ended and we know very well that also in this case the role as protagonist was certainly not reserved for the Italian part That is why we are convinced that if a treaty were to be made it would have to be put on a different footing As Mr Casini mentioned earlier in fact Italy 's national interest was certainly not that of France in the Libyan affair What happened in Libya against the Gaddafi regime did not happen for humanitarian reasons or to defend civil rights it happened because France was annoyed by the privileged economic relationship that the Italian Government of which you were a member at the time Mr. Undersecretary had managed to establish with the Gaddafi regime which was certainly not democratic like so many others with whom the West does not have problems maintaining and encouraging economic relations Even today France supports a part which is not the part of freedom and democracy it supports General Haftar who is certainly no less dictatorial and more democratic than Gaddafi As for migration policy how can we hide the unqualified behavior in this case yes in violation of the basic humanitarian rights that France holds in Ventimiglia sending back even minors qualifying them for adulthood even if they are obviously thirteen fourteen and fifteen years old children or sending back migrants taking off their shoes If Italy did such things what would happen The UN would come if we behaved like France does to migrants trying to cross the Italian French border So ladies and gentlemen we are voting no for all these reasons and above all because the true bipolarism that is being affirmed not yet in this House reflecting numbers that no longer exist in reality but in the country among Italians is that between a Democratic Party subordinate to the French interests and Brothers of Italy that as Giorgia Meloni says is the real and only guarantor of national interest
Balboni FdI Mr President I would like to ask the Government to report urgently to the House on the scandalous decision taken today by the French court on the request for extradition of criminal terrorists who had been arrested for serious terrorist offences committed in Italy including the murder of Calabresi This is a scandalous decision which contradicts in a shameful way the much warned Quirinale Treaty which I would like to remind you had a paragraph specifically devoted to cooperation in the field of justice between France and Italy Italy cannot tolerate that after forty years These criminals and murderers continue to enjoy substantial immunity in the name of the so called Mitterrand doctrine which we as Italians hoped imagined and believed was finally archived These criminals must pay their debt with Italian justice I believe that we must all express our full solidarity with the families of the victims and we must demand that justice follow its course without favorable treatment in respect of an ideology that has marked a path of blood years of lead that the Italians want to forget so that we can really turn the page however justice must be done I therefore ask on behalf of the Brothers of Italy Group that the Government immediately report on this very serious incident and on the initiatives it intends to take at diplomatic level with France so that this decision can be challenged and annulled
"Mrs. Minister Franceschini during the lockdown with closed theatres and cinemas and without being able to participate in concerts or shows the idea of establishing a digital platform that would allow all Italian artists and museums to distribute content streaming for a fee seemed interesting With regret however we have to note that the management recorded heavy losses almost 7,5 million euros in fact reducing its liquidity since the company had taken off with approximately 16 million euros effective of which approximately 6,5 million euros paid by Cassa deposits and loans and 10 million euros from the Ministry of Culture with the decree throwing again In its first year of life ITsART with 1,400 content titles offered has recorded only 141,000 users but an even smaller number once entered the platform bought something One of the causes of this flop is to be seen mainly in the lack of advertising this platform does not know anyone Minister Moreover the analysts of the field advance other hypotheses on this economic failure a collection of titles not attractive but above all prices totally out of market 7 euros for the virtual tour of a museum when the ticket to visit it in person costs 10 documentaries to 5 euros films that are available in streaming free everywhere also on Raiplay while on ITsART they are paid I therefore ask you after the change of the third CEO in less than a year what is ITsART 's industrial strategy who will have to continue to finance this platform or if instead it is not the case to stop the operation which has proved economically unsustainable more rightly in view of the exceptionally negative economic situation so as not to justify such an expenditure of resources of the Italian taxpayers Finally Minister since the intention is to disseminate content and products made by the great Italian cultural institutions why not instead of ITsART we call it an Italian name"
Minister I am not satisfied with your reply and I explain why It is the duty of politics to intervene when the money of the Italians is spent which should be invested in a moment of crisis like this one to give answers Good morning can be seen from the morning Definitely this platform started with an intent but it started late almost at the end of the pandemic and certainly did not prove to be up to the Italian sector of culture which is a world excellence There have been and have emerged as you said before of the naiveties let us call them so management Of course the offer was n't competitive and did n't even include an agreement with RaiPlay on the cost of the films We are seeing what the Italian situation is there will be some restrictions in the autumn with the cinemas that continue to close and that are forced to fire their employees with artists and underpaid workers I find this unacceptable because the serious thing is that millions of euros of Italian taxpayers have been wasted unnecessarily We will continue to watch hoping there will be a reversal of the march As it has been managed so far I would ask you to consider closing the platform and using the funds to give answers and act as an economic flywheel for the cultural and tourism sectors because we know that they often have little money at their disposal
"Madam President fellow senators members of the Government as a group we have tried in any way to improve this bill by tabling many amendments as we did when we examined other measures These are proposals that arise from listening to the citizens to the productive categories to the civil society actors who come from the real country and who alas in many cases have been ignored The impression is that at least in part an opportunity has been lost to carry out a measure that would have really reached the heart of the problem and would have given back breath to many categories Courageous measures are needed and that is what we are asking for We will vote in favour of this bill for a sense of responsibility it is a measure that tries to temporarily buffer the situation and in a minimal way a part of the criticalities and urgency of the country These are non-resolutionary measures In the future we need a measure in which the Government takes care of all the emergencies trying to lower the costs of the raw materials that increase to take care of the workers starting from the fragile subjects from their families and I am referring to the many Italian families that because of the increases in the cost of living can no longer reach the end of the month Turning to the measure under consideration there is one aspect that I would like to stress in relation to which as a group we have tabled specific aid proposals on several occasions I am referring to the theme of the municipalities in failure I am thinking of my city Terni administered today by the League and the center right but victim of a previous bad administrative management which caused the breakdown of the agency Like Terni there are Potenza and other municipalities which face the difficult situation of an inherited disaster Anyone in this House who has been a local administrator and has had the honour like me to represent the citizens as city councilman city councilman or first citizen knows the difficulties they encounter every day in managing a city Local administrators make daily mortal jumps with mirabolous enterprises to manage the complex municipal machine with the few means available The normal and multiple criticalities of an administration have been exacerbated by the pandemic and more recently by the war in Ukraine and institutions are very hard to carry out everyday activities and to guarantee citizens even minimum services It is already considerably difficult and complex to carry on the ordinary administration imagine what it can mean to manage a municipality in economic failure at a time like this characterized by many risk factors Well even in this draft law as on many other occasions we have tabled more amendments in order to help the municipalities in failure In this case our amending proposal has been transformed into an agenda I am aware that the economic commitment to this type of municipality is very costly but I believe that the Government 's task must also be this The Central Executive must provide local administrators with the tools to be able to govern and manage the institution at its best it is a duty to which the Government cannot escape The failing municipalities should be a priority because the citizens the services offered to them and their quality of life should be a priority I would have preferred that the Government had already taken charge of the provincial capital municipalities that are experiencing this particular economic situation However I welcome the commitment that has finally been given to us by the Finance and Treasury Commission with responsibility The Commission will include in the first useful measure the proposal of the League aimed at preventing municipalities such as Terni and Potenza from going into default An appreciable result that confirms the great commitment of my party and that strengthens our closeness to the needs of the territories One aspect of this measure that I would like to stress is the work done I can only welcome the adoption of our amendment which will allow more than 100,000 people to continue working It is thanks to this amendment that it becomes possible to exceed the time limit of employment beyond the twenty four months of workers engaged under an indefinite employment contract by the Employment Agency and sent on a temporary mission to the same company with the extension until 30 June 2024 for workers engaged under an indefinite employment contract by the Employment Agency without this determining the user to establish an indefinite employment relationship with the employee administered This eliminates what was in fact an obstacle to the continued employment of the workers being administered The need to postpone the entry into force of the 24 month limit to 30 June was to save at least 100,000 jobs put at risk by the employee turnover and the introduction of this time limit 18.22 Alexandrini followed I would like to thank the Undersecretary for his valuable work for his work and social policies Senator Tiziana Nisini who among other things summoned a Table to the Ministry to find a solution with all the representative associations involved I would also like to thank the entire Group of the League for its efforts in this situation too to ensure that this amendment is also accepted A valuable job even more for 100,000 families It is thanks to the League to the Government that these goals have been achieved and this is also the real meaning and motivation of our presence in the Executive to improve the quality of life of Italians PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator Calandrini is registered to speak You have the right to do so"
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government it is my intention to share with you all a reflection on the importance that PNRR can take on in an area that I consider essential for the development of our society I am referring to education and training There are more hours spent in school than with the family it is at school that relationships are established not only of study for the children and of work for the teaching staff and not but also of friendship and sharing The school world is such a large container that inside it you find the universe not only education and work but the development of personality the growth of relationships sociality feelings and emotions and when you are a teacher you do not limit yourself to providing a service but you enter into the lives of children and families and they enter into yours with the creation of empathy and relationships The world of school has a strategic importance for the formation of tomorrow 's citizens and we must show respect consideration and sense of responsibility towards that world all too often forgotten developed by policies that are not respectful for the teaching class and for students as if it were a sector of series b. The young people and the teaching class perceive all this with a sense of discomfort because if we do not invest in a prudent way with the diligence of the good father of the family as was said making the best use of the opportunity of the PNRR we miss yet another opportunity to embark on a virtuous path And acting when it 's too late can mean not acting at all In this decree law we try to respond to what Europe asks us to do in the face of the share part of the financing of the Next generation EU equal to 24 billion that is a selection and training of the teachers that aim at the acquisition of pedagogical skills teaching and above all of the innovative didactics It is established that for the teaching profession of secondary schools of first and second degree including technical practical teachers it is necessary to undertake a university and academic course of initial training and qualification and then to make a competition in order to enter the role Access to the enabling routes is selective and the number is decided annually on the basis of the needs of teachers The course will allow the achievement of 60 university credits CFU which will allow access to the competitions at the professorship The attendance of these courses will be compulsory and in presence the latter criterion may be waived by a maximum of 20 All perfect a new world but a legislator who can be said to be so cannot ignore the imperfect world that exists today and must try to balance the legitimate expectations of new teachers with the rights that claim teachers who have allowed the school to operate in these years For example the theme of the 24 CFU was highly controversial The text fired by the Government a few weeks ago in fact did not contain any specification on what up to now is a requirement to access ordinary competitions for teachers School legislation must continue a mechanism cannot be envisaged until the day before and the next day it can be revolutionized without transitional arrangements Fortunately the senators have sheltered this Applause goes to the majority who at this time and at other times worked compactly and determined to improve a too drastic text in many respects to use euphemism On the financial cover front too the struggle was tough to cover the expenditure items of the new training mechanism with the resources of the teacher 's card seemed really indigestible and also on this aspect fortunately there was a change of pace Uncertainties remain about the cut of the chairs expected in 10,000 in the initial text now reduced on the basis of the criterion of demographic decline and turnover of 2026 Other adjustments have been approved in the Senate access for the first three cycles of the initial training course of those who are in service in the state or equal school within the limits of the reserve of the places indicated the remission to the national bargaining of the incentive the return in the beehive of the negotiation of the definition of the number of additional hours the access to the specialization on support for those who have already carried out three years in the activity We would have liked a greater consideration of the thousands of precarious people used for years in the school that could not have been enabled due to the lack of dedicated paths however it could have been expected that enabling paths for all categories of teachers could be foreseen to provide for the extension of the transitional phase in order to absorb the historical precariousness 2024 is too limited a time He should have insisted more and not bowed too much to the European Diktats The re-opening of the merit rankings of the candidates in the competitions would also have been useful Finally it is sad to think by the end of 2024 i.e. that fixed for the hypothetical absorption of the precarious ones of the access to the first open ended test may be this subordinate with DPCM to the overcoming of a pre-elective test I come from the world of school you know I am a teacher it is a professional role that has allowed me to be close to families and pupils in a climate of deep collaboration and growth especially through active listening also on the territories of all school staff managers administrative technical and auxiliary staff ATA the director of general and administrative services DSGA teachers in reflection pupils and families The school in addition to being an educational service to people represents a powerful strategic factor for the social and economic development of each country the cultural and professional formation of the new generations the true levers of our future depend on the school Along with all this the school still acts as a social elevator increasing and enhancing talents and changing destinies The education sector is the real pillar of our society the engine for our country 's socio-economic recovery at this time of great difficulties caused by the pandemic crisis and the consequences of the war in Ukraine I believe and hope that these reflections of mine also dictated by professional experience will be shared by everyone In addition in view of what many have said and last but not least by President Draghi politics in the institutional fora must respond decisively and concretely the school must return to being at the heart of every government 's commitment and we have demonstrated it these days It is necessary to have the courage to make a change of pace to invest more economic resources in the sector and to undertake compulsory training courses which do not favour inequalities but which aim exclusively to promote the professional growth of teachers All teachers need to be valued and can be valued if motivated and satisfied by their work they need a greater economic dignity precisely because of their important function and deserve respect from the moment of recruitment until they are put in place The recruitment of teachers cannot be translated into a cross quiz it is necessary to select teachers for their ability to convey love for knowledge for their ability to do innovative and inclusive teaching The real recruitment is on the ground and starts from that spirit that the teachers demonstrated with dedication and courage during the pandemic improvising platforms and new teaching methods for the love of their pupils so as not to make them lose their educational paths We are now investing in decisive policy action The renewal of the school requires a shared path listening to those who live it daily I conclude by thanking rapporteurs the members of the Commissions the Undersecretaries the Group Leaders in particular Senators Saponara and Pirovano who have followed us in this difficult and complex path from which emerged a cohesive and determined parliamentary majority to achieve common objectives for education demonstrating that sense of responsibility which I hope will be repeated in the actions of the Government that sense of responsibility which at a time of economic and social crisis of war of pandemics of uncertainty such as this in which citizens seek concrete and effective answers from those who govern them should serve as a lighthouse for our political action and our work"
ALESSANDRINI L- SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen Senators Minister the bill that we are going to vote on which delegates to the Government for the support and enhancement of the family provides for the adoption of measures to support parenthood and aims to help families and young couples who want to move away from the original core to build their own life plan to start flying with their wings towards the future A future that politics has a duty to protect and support It is a starting point which emphasizes the family theme We need to do much more and it is essential to work in this direction to achieve measures that really improve the lives of families In Italy the family theme is central both from a cultural and social point of view We are in fact one of the countries in which this aspect is stronger and more distinctive The family is the fundamental social nucleus and is the basis of our educational and training system the Constitution itself affirms its value and the need for protection Despite the centrality recognized culturally socially and constitutionally to the early social formation in which the individual develops the family in recent years has been debased by a unique thought which someone has tried to impose A unique thought that tried to distort it and make it less and less central In Italy the legislation that protection is completely inadequate and our feeling often runs counter to a legal system that does not support it as it should We consider this measure to be a first step in trying to adapt legislation to the social changes that have been going on for a long time The family itself has changed over the years along with society Unfortunately legislation has not been updated and has remained anchored to a self managing family model where roles were well defined The present family has different needs and its members have legitimate aspirations far from those of the past and politics has the task of intervening in favor of its development We here have a duty to do so a duty which is dictated to us by Article 31 of the Constitution when it states The Republic shall facilitate with economic measures and other provisions the training of the family and the performance of the related tasks with particular regard to large families It protects motherhood childhood and youth encouraging the institutions necessary for this purpose The draft law in question the so called family act includes measures that are part of the reforms provided for by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan intended for families with children and in order to promote the parenthood and the social and educational function of families to combat denatality to enhance the harmonious growth of girls and children promoting the financial autonomy of young people and the reconciliation of family life with work in particular women It is only the first step in a path that we hope will lead to measures that really help households Denatality amplified in an exponential way also by the Covid epidemic is a problem that can no longer be neglected It is a phenomenon that for the dimensions reached needs a clear and concrete intervention from the Government That is what we expect and ask We must put young people in a position to have children and we have a duty to ensure that their family desire is not opposed by the uncertainty of tomorrow We must do so by means of rules that allow working mothers to continue to work so that they no longer have to choose between the desire to become mothers and the desire to become mothers professionally Unfortunately reconciling work with the care of children involves a review of the times a reorganization of one 's life and priorities and this is difficult Not rarely does a high percentage of women leave their jobs after giving birth to a child Policies are needed to reconcile these two aspects of a woman 's life flexible leave and work organization measures which encourage women to return to work after maternity We cannot allow a new mom to be forced to give up her job This must be one of our objectives and our action must be aimed at achieving it It is essential for us to create a path of rules that really and concretely help young people who want to create their own family facilitating their economic and social independence We believe that it is the task of the State to intervene by providing services that can help parents to face the phase after the birth of a child which represents a radical change in the life of a man and a woman Contributions are needed to cover the costs to be borne by new parents for kindergartens and infancy schools We also hope that the services that support families with home services will be activated for those who have children or children under six years of age Both parents must be placed in a position to continue working and cannot be restrained in their aspirations by the construction of their dream of life We consider the birthday a great defeat for our country and we have always fought to support parenting Action is also needed to promote greater equality within the family Family roles must be complementary and interchangeable This would allow the mother to continue her work and not give up her legitimate career expectations The rules must change together with society and the needs of the people to whom they are addressed What has been done so far with the universal single cheque is a first approach to solving the problem but it is not enough The universal single grant on the one hand simplifies the procedure of access to the measure deburring it making it more streamlined and simplified on the other hand however it does not fully satisfy families especially the larger ones It is therefore only the beginning of a path in which the League wants to be an active part We believe that the direction taken is the right one but much more needs to be done The family act contains a series of provisions that try to respond to needs in a broad and integrated way grasping the necessarily complex and multidimensional aspects of the problems that affect our country related to the denatality and ability of families to support their children The negative trend must be reversed as soon as possible with incisive interventions aimed at combining parenthood with the working prospects of both parents We must allow couples to bring forth children without fear of the future Some of the measures included in the text go in this direction On this occasion too I would like to stress that our objective is to protect all families with children not excluded We hope that there will be no more serious families and families of series b and that all workers regardless of the activities they carry out will have access to the facilities provided for those who bring a child into the world Common sense therefore invites us to extend the rules on parental leave also to self employed workers with specific measures that assess the needs and peculiarities of the various professions giving them the same opportunities and the same protection as employees It is also desirable to encourage employers involved in the implementation of policies that harmonise private and professional life and promote the conjugation of these two aspects which are equally important and fundamental to the lives of each individual Using the instrument of flexible work agile work teleworking and smart working for mothers and fathers in the post birth period and in the first months and years of the child 's life is definitely a good start to meet the needs of those who want to create a family As a Group we agree with the Government which has already expressed its support by accepting an agenda which is shared by the whole Commission I would like to thank our President and rapporteur Mrs Matrisciano for this and also for the way in which she has carried out the work We agree on the opening of a technical working table on the drafting of the implementing decrees in order to ensure the widest possible involvement of the institutional actors concerned so that the rules are balanced on the real needs of the users of the measures and facilities The table is a useful means of comparison that we hope will give substance and concreteness to the intentions of the extensors of the bill in question The measures contained in this measure are urgent Senator Pillon has already spoken about the issue of the ISEE and the current calculation mechanism which is not appropriate Because of a sense of responsibility towards Italians towards those in clear economic difficulty and towards what we are here to represent it is certainly necessary to proceed quickly and as happened in the House we also show in this House that we really care about the needs of citizens and their future For all these reasons I announce the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione
Mr President members of the Government colleagues it was an important job a shared choral work and I would like to thank the Presidents the rapporteurs and all the Members of the 7th and 11th Commissions of which I am a member The approval of this bill which delegates the Government in the matter of entertainment is a first step towards the full recognition of the rights of workers in this sector since always unfortunately considered at least as far as legislative protections children of a minor god It was during the pandemic that we finally realized the need to make an in depth focus on this sector which was certainly among the most penalized by the crisis linked to the Covid The analysis of the situation has revealed poor legislation which guaranteed little or nothing those who work in the entertainment world with poor standards that did not fully protect the workers in the sector The work situation of the entertainment sector had to be looked at for a long time and deserved to be addressed in concrete terms We had the opportunity to finally take control of the situation by addressing the problems of workers in the sector and trying to solve them With this bill a first brick is put in place and the Government is delegated to provide for measures to carry out the reorganization of the laws and regulations on entertainment as well as the reorganization and revision of the shock absorbers allowances and temporary economic support instruments in favour of the workers in the sector enrolled in the pension fund workers of the show Measures are provided that restore dignity to those employed in this sector who qualify and professionalise the various figures who clearly regulate and frame the worker ensuring protection also in case of illness and giving guarantees for pension purposes In many cases unfortunately in the common imagination the worker of the artistic spectacle or culture is often assimilated to a hobbyist to the one who enjoys doing this type of activity or who does it pass me the phrase colored to lost time because he has another job with an income that allows him to live The subtitle of this concept is it has fun and fun while working not bad if it does not have the same guarantees as other workers This is absolutely dequalifying unfair and does not correspond to reality Those who come to provide an artistic performance most often do so after years of study sacrifices and trials with an important training behind them Wrongly as profanes we only consider the artist 's commitment only with regard to the hours in which he is engaged in the show or at the most extend his possible work involvement to the hours spent in the rehearsals Unfortunately in many cases when we talk about show we totally ignore the study and training that brings the artist to that particular performance To emerge in any sector including the artistic one it is not enough to have talent but there is a need for dedication and sacrifice Being prepared for a certain activity may possibly facilitate us but in order to move from being in power to becoming an act commodating the philosopher Aristotle there are years of study kilometres travelled exercises books consumed and all that follows The paradigm must be radically changed working in this sector is not a pastime and deserves the protection granted to other workers The measure that we are going to vote on today after a fruitful debate in the Commission in which we have managed to improve aspects in our opinion that are lacking begins to rearrange the sector in a way that is functional to the improvement of the quality of the services offered makes the protection for the providers of work and regularizes them I have taken action to introduce an important amendment to promote the entry into the labour market of young people studying subjects relevant to the sector I am referring to children with a diploma in higher secondary education who come from professional schools with an address in cultural and entertainment services and with courses related to fashion mechanics electronics electrical engineering and their ability to work in the entertainment industry For them we have asked to promote the activation of training and guidance internships also through the conclusion of special agreements with the professionals in the field of fashion and entertainment an additional piece to help them concretely enter this world This bill is a fundamental step in the path towards proper recognition and support and the definition of guarantees for workers in the entertainment world Let 's not just imagine the successful actor or the singer who fills the stadiums with his concerts let 's think about the workers those who work in the sector in a professional way those who engage daily carrying out their activities like any other worker in another sector those who have to work that mountain hours to get a decent salary There are thousands of professionals in theatre music cinema opera dance and all performing arts who will finally thanks to this legislation be able to count on new safeguards and guarantees This is the real first important and substantial intervention with regard to the entertainment sector We are at the side of the government and for this reason I thank the Ministers who have taken care of this work and in particular the Undersecretary for Culture Senator Lucia Borgonzoni who has personally paid for the drafting of this measure As a League we are very attentive to the problems of those who work in this sector and during the pandemic we have repeatedly urged interventions and refreshments to soothe the inevitable economic recession of the workers of the live show We are aware that this text does not fully meet the expectations of these workers but we are equally convinced that the path taken is the right one and that the Government and the Commission will work so that the situation in the future can improve significantly There must no longer be A and B workers because those who work in the entertainment sector in many cases feel abandoned to themselves and we can no longer allow that
ALESSANDRINI L- SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen the Government I would like to thank the rapporteurs Senator Nencini and Senator Cangini and the Government in the person of our Undersecretary Lucia Borgonzoni for involving me as an active part of this process as a Umbrian Member of Parliament I thank President Donatella Tesei together with her we have carefully followed the whole process of this bill that has carried on until today and goes to confirm that since we were elected we are spending on the valorization of our territory This bill is also very important in this key We are going to vote today on a measure that comes after a path shared with all the actors involved made of comparisons meetings and proposals We managed to achieve a synthesis very quickly thanks to the active collaboration of every political religious spiritual and institutional component Allow me to express my great satisfaction at the acceptance in the Commission of the amendments tabled which in the celebratory activities strengthen the presence of the territory that has seen the birth and growth of St. Francis Umbria is a land that has given birth to many saints and which is deeply linked to its cultural and Christian roots in particular to the figure of St. Francis It is true that St. Francis is the patron saint of Italy and not only represents Assisi or Umbria but as Umbria we are proud that he was born and lived in our Region We are proud to find his traces in the many places that Francis touched on his journey and that he listed our colleague but we are aware that his spiritual heritage and his message do not belong to us The Franciscan message is in fact a true patrimony of humanity so timely that it is included in the draft law under consideration A provision that in Article 1 states that the Republic celebrates the figure of Saint Francis of Assisi on the occasion of the eighth centenary of death can only meet our approval because celebrating Francis means recognizing the value of our roots of our historical and cultural heritage it means leaving it as a legacy to future generations and sharing it with the rest of the world Let us not forget in fact that the figure of St. Francis is also known and loved abroad The bill provides for the establishment of the national committee with the task of developing a cultural program related to life work and places related to the figure of the saint including restoration activities of things subject to the protection of cultural and landscape heritage as well as research activities editorials training exhibitions and the organization and management of events in the cultural historical literary scientific and artistic fields of high value All this in a modern and modern perspective is the figure of Francis A perspective of internationalization tourism promotion and technological innovation but above all as mentioned focusing attention on the aspects of the Franciscan message concerning respect and care for the environment dialogue between religions and peaceful coexistence between peoples A current message today more than ever in this historical moment a figure to which to vote with authentic faith in the hope that its protection can wrap all peoples today tormented by events we would never have expected to witness and live Among the aims the main one will be to disseminate in Italy and abroad the knowledge of the thought and work of man and of the saint who has been able to leave an indelible trace in his journey This will also be possible through the involvement of the fields of school education high artistic musical and coreautic training university and research but the committee will also have the task of developing programmes aimed at promoting cultural activities related to the celebration involving public or private bodies of proven experience Another important function will be to prepare programs aimed at promoting processes of cultural development in the territory of valorization and tourist promotion of the Franciscan places and paths and of commercial promotion in the cultural context related to the celebration Last but not least there will be important editorial publications of undoubted historical and cultural value In the light of the above I declare the vote in favour of the Senators of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo D'Azione Group to the attention of the Assembly
LUNESU L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is an honour for me as a Sardinian to commemorate on behalf of the League a great protagonist of Italian politics Enrico Berlinguer a man destined to become a protagonist of the democratic life of our country He was certainly if not the greatest the most beloved secretary of the greatest western communist party A hundred years after his birth as well as remembering who he was and what he did it is important to reflect on what remains of political action of his ideas of his progressive drive with which he dealt with current issues Dolce Enrico sang Antonello Venditti if I were still there the world changes the only thing that remains is a more true injustice He fought against injustice The political idea that animated Berlinguer was permeated with absolute integrity ideal intransigence constant and tenacious attention to the general interest and public good deep and unwavering convictions that led him to raise the great theme of morality in politics and to see without fear before others what was happening in the deepest folds of our country the degeneration of public life the spread of occult powers the hypertrophy of the party system and the transformation of some of them into pure instruments of consensus and power It was the man who could trace a furrow between Italian and Soviet communism when with extreme courage in the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union PCUS in 1976 he performed that rift by uttering words such as democracy and pluralism which earned him the cover of the Time and the hatred of Soviet orthodoxy Enrico Berlinguer had the courage to support his ideas moving for the good of the country superior to that of his own party to seek the agreement with Aldo Moro in the historical compromise which was stopped only by the assassination of the leader of the DC but not only also to meet several times the secretary of the Italian Social Movement heir of fascism to understand together how to save the Republic from red and black terrorists Berlinguer 's thought was a long thought working for peace always and anyway pacifism today as it was then is exchanged as partisan for a political force while it must be remembered that working for peace is our duty Speaking of the future he said that you are saved and you go forward if you act together and not just one by one Indro Montanelli described him as an introverted and melancholic man of immaculate honesty always struggling with a demanding lonely conscience of spontaneous habits more troubled than enticed by the perspective of power and in perfect good faith Of him remains a social program a political program economic ethical and moral unwritten fundamental for the democratic future and progress of our country It is the capacity for long term analysis that would historically make him a prophet in the desert compared to the political cultural offer of the 1980s The moral question highlights the profoundly political nature inherent in the question of representation Berlinguer would have been among the first to understand that the superb occupation of the state gangs by the parties was opening a gap between the political class and civil society It is important to emphasise Berlinguer 's attention to sensitive issues such as the limited resources and environmental compatibility its reflection on the potential good and bad uses of new technologies the strong sensitivity shown to the gap between North and South of the world the understanding of the need to tackle globally the upcoming challenges of the new millennium He was a leader able to openly question a model of society centered on the profit and the intensive exploitation of resources a leader able to indicate new trajectories of social progress in the context of the end of the twentieth century with the awareness of the need for change and at the same time the attempt to coincide continuity and transformation tradition and innovation In some moments the first characteristics constraints and limits that came from an identity its history and its time prevailed but in most cases it shone its ability to look far away to produce the accelerations it felt necessary
"LUNESU L SP PSd Az Mr President representative of the Government ladies and gentlemen the draft law under consideration was adopted at first reading by the House as has already been mentioned by my colleagues and it has now been improved with the passage to the Senate on precisely those aspects that could raise some critical issues We are talking about a very important issue health transparency The draft law contains the transparency and the right to knowledge of the relationships of economic importance or advantage between companies producing medicines tools equipment goods and services including non-health products and entities operating in the field of health including health organisations In recent years the principle of transparency has been deepened and analysed from many points of view In our party we are truly convinced that transparency is important and useful if it allows all citizens to know to understand the use of public resources to value their purposes the costs in relation to performance stimulating the appropriateness and the comparison between providers and territories encouraging the search for excellence identifying the responsibilities and the roles of every public and non-profit institutional subject The need for transparency could on more than one occasion clash with the right to data protection but in this respect there are many rules and provisions that intervene precisely in the fight against corruption and conflict of interest However a transparency rule must never be confused with a punitive rule That is not the point of the measure before the House today although we are aware that there are unclear situations which can sometimes also lead to corruption Measures such as this are aimed at strengthening the relationship of loyalty with citizens Accessibility to data and documents is also intended to protect citizens rights to promote the participation of those concerned in administrative activity and to promote widespread forms of control over the pursuit of institutional functions and the use of public resources There are many measures that go in this direction from the code of conduct of civil servants to the anti-corruption plan from the introduction of the pact of integrity between public ministers and companies participating in the tenders in Article 13 of the draft competition law in these days to the examination of the competent committees of the Senate With regard to Article 13 of the draft competition law which will have to arrive in the Chamber the aim of the PNRR is with regard to the provision of services at regional level in the health field to introduce more transparent modalities and criteria in the accreditation system in order to facilitate periodic verifications and reviews of the same on the qualitative results actually achieved by the operators These are all measures aimed at a timely tracking of resources in order to avoid possible conflicts of interest and to ensure that resources are allocated effectively In detail the provision transmitted by the Chamber of Deputies has been amended by providing for an increase in the amounts for which advertising is required It is therefore necessary to publish for each individual operator the utilities that have a unit value of more than 100 euros per single donation for a total annual total of more than 1,000 euros For each health organization on the other hand special advertising of payments or utilities with a unit value of more than 1,000 euros and up to 2,500 euros will have to be given In addition to this the changes introduced also provide for the publicity of any conventions For the rest the measure has remained essentially the one already approved by the colleagues of the House Surely the establishment of the public electronic register will play a fundamental role in the tracing of data and we therefore hope that the measure will really enter into force within six months of publication in the Official Journal which will take place after the subsequent passage of the measures to the Chamber of Deputies For all these reasons I declare the vote in favour of the measure of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione"
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government I would like to thank the two rapporteurs Senator Collina and Senator Ripamonti for having followed and brought to the House on a timely basis the measure that we are going to vote on today The aim of this draft law is to tackle a number of rules covering as many areas as possible local public services energy transport waste start up of business activities and market surveillance It is in practice a process of reform in order to bring us into line with Europe This is for example the mapping of concessions of goods in order to promote maximum publicity and transparency on port services the distribution of natural gas hydro- electric concessions which for all should have been started by 31 December 2022 With regard to state property concessions and management relationships for tourist recreational and sporting purposes the extension was granted on 31 December 2024 thanks to an amendment to the text with the amendment desired by the League It is important that the Government envisages the recognition of the actual commercial start up value of the companies net of the investments made over the years In practice work has been done to protect the nature of businesses even small and family run as the only source of income the recognition of the professional and technical experience of the sector for stability eco-sustainability the usability of structures by people with disabilities at the same time as respect for the environment and culture The right of pre-emption to existing dealers will also have to be guaranteed in order to protect the 30,000 families and 300,000 workers in the sector who have dedicated and currently devote their lives to the activities and services necessary for the well being of the environment and citizens I am referring in particular to the beaches It should be emphasized that our rapporteur has managed to remove from the text of the measure that award criterion for those who have experience in managing public goods that reminds me a little the so much criticized practice of the lawyer a legal instrument that allows to participate in the tenders without technical and professional requirements being able to use those of other companies The commitment of the League has been to bring reformulations to the text of the Government in order to guarantee to the outgoing concessionaire a fair compensation that will be paid by the successor concessionaire the sums to be paid recognized with the implementing decrees will be concerted with the enterprises of the field and this is a very important thing The opposition must play its role of stimulus and criticism but I think it is ingenious not to recognize the effort and work done by our representatives no one excluded who through their intervention have created the conditions to discourage and remove any speculators Another important area in my opinion is dealt with in Article 5 of the measure which concerns concessions of major hydropower The League is the author of a reformulation approved in the Commission confirming the regularisation of the hydroelectric sector At last enough with the attempt of some political forces to demolish one of the first concrete forms of autonomy of the Regions enough to benefit the concessionaires to the detriment of the citizens on the water charges with heavy erial damages to the mountain territories We as League have always fought these maneuvers With the reassignment of concessions by the Regions will finally be recognized appropriate fees to the mountain territories concerned environmental compensations free electricity supply After twenty years of stalemate a season of great investments will start to modernize and re-launch the hydroelectric It will give the impetus to the creation of the power plant network the installation of infrastructure by local authorities and motorway concessions with criteria for the selection of operators so that everything takes place in transparency Let 's say it 's a strategic asset for our nation to bet everything on energy from renewable sources and reduce our dependence on energy from abroad President on energy independence which is of great use at the moment I would like to draw the attention of the Government to one example the need to consider a project of absolute public benefit which has been financed with private funds and which has already obtained the environmental impact assessment EIA since 24 March 2021 It is the installation of a regasification terminal to the Port channel of Cagliari which awaits the understanding from the Sardinia Region demanded from the Ministry of the ecological transition It is a reminder that I first make to myself but it is necessary that all interested parties make an effort to speed up all those operations that can benefit In this case it is my Region but the growth will certainly be for the whole nation"
"LUNESU L SP PSd Az Mr President today in this House we are going to take that long awaited step forward the third reading of the bill of popular initiative so that islands such as Sardinia and Sicily can be recognised as the natural disadvantage of insularity and introduce the necessary measures to ensure effective equality and real enjoyment of inalienable individual rights which was eliminated in 2001 as has already been said with the reform of Title V I would like to thank the President of the Senate 's Committee on Constitutional Affairs Senator Parrini and his members for giving a favourable opinion on the text Today 's vote which I hope will be unanimous will follow the last passage to the House that if it happens within the summer will soon lead us to the expected finish line Dear President kind senators you cannot imagine how important it is for us Sardinians to approve this bill which adds the following paragraph to Article 119 The Republic recognises the peculiarity of the Islands and promotes the measures necessary to remove the disadvantages of insularity There are several essential points I would like to mention Among these I quote the extension to all territorial authorities and not only to the Regions as currently envisaged the autonomy of income and expenditure so that they enjoy autonomous resources and can fix and apply their own taxes and revenues the application for state law the establishment of an equalisation fund absent in the previous text is consistent with the logic of fiscal decentralisation in which the territories are responsible in the choices of expenditure and in the related decisions for their financing intervention of support of territories in which revenues are not adequate and is therefore a reason for less development less growth measured by the lower fiscal capacity and not by the administrative inefficiency of the territorial body additional state resources special interventions in favour of those entities in order to pursue one of the following aims to promote economic development cohesion and social solidarity to renew economic imbalances and to promote the exercise of the rights of persons It is precisely the existence of the geographical condition the insularity which constitutes its specialty which is reflected in the sectors of the economy in the way we do business in the cost of transport and at a time when digital innovation is applied everywhere to new technologies for a strong propensity to change it is not easy believe me for us This is why it is urgent to intervene and this law will be an excellent tool an excellent measure that will necessarily have to be filled with content The State will then have to be the bearer of this project The Sardinian citizens have understood that a new scenario will open for the islands that has involved in addition to institutional representatives municipalities universities trade unions and professional associations schools migrant circles and that provides for equal opportunities especially in the world of work where they will compete on equal terms of departure It is a battle in synergy with Sicily the concept is a conscious insularity where the protection of the landscape civic uses language and culture can have an adequate recognition I would like to point out that from this important initiative born about five years ago with a strong proposal and decided through the collection of 200,000 signatures the promotion of a referendum the committee led by the late Mr Frongia the scientific committee led by Professor Mongiu the establishment of a special regional committee chaired by Mr Michele Costa and the continuation of the parliamentary process of the constitutional bill have included numerous legislative initiatives by the Regional Council and the Sardinian parliamentarians of all political groups which have decisively strengthened the need to fill the gap due to the serious natural disadvantage with a compactness that is rarely found As a parliamentary representative I cannot tolerate a productive island having to leave with a huge deficit like it has today There is the energy problem primarily due to the lack of methane and the transport of energy at very high costs which also applies to waste and its management At a time like this when the expensive bills bring Italy to its knees and not only families and businesses are affected the high energy also affects the local authorities with the risk of cuts for services Let us imagine the consequences for those who are disadvantaged In the island territories we have no possibility to bridge the territorial discontinuity with infrastructural interventions We need immaterial interventions that take their nature into account The State aid scheme is often ineffective and is not able to support companies Targeted legal arrangements and specific European regulations are needed to steer future policy towards the transport and long term energy sector For these reasons the recognition of the principle of insularity in the Constitution has gathered the consent of all civil society and not only It represents a transversal political and social battle It combines all Sardinian political groups cultural associations businesses the world of volunteering culture and sport Therefore on behalf of my Group I am so proud to vote in favour"
Mr President ladies and gentlemen this measure approved by the Council of Ministers contains urgent measures to eradicate the spread of African swine fever Eradicating the plague in wild boars and preventing infection in farmed pigs is an important intervention for the protection of the national pig population and of the entire chain It should be pointed out that in Sardinia PSA was practically eradicated and belongs to genotype 1 The PSA arrived in Piedmont Emilia Romagna and Liguria is of genotype 2 and if it were to expand it would be really dangerous for the mega pigsty of the Po Valley Those of Sardinia and the other regions are two distinct situations but Sardinia can be an example to understand the initial mistakes There were more or less sporadic cases which for some decades were not worthy of special health care perhaps because the virus did not cause damage to human health The main consequences of this were the economic consequences for farmers and cold cuts especially for the European Union 's blockade of exports of products from the entire Sardinian pig sector In a few years a pillar of the Sardinian economy had been destroyed But what were the actions of the then regional administration which for long years had been limited to selective killing in herds affected by the virus As we all know the major problem and anti-popular solution was the widespread practice of wild grazing of pigs in the vast state estates of Supramonte and Gennargentu The free pasture of pigs in continuous contact with wild boars a very erratic species was the main cause of the spread of the disease leading the administration to the establishment of a project unit for the eradication of PSA formed by health representatives FoReSTAS agriculture and environment The regional government thus begins with the adoption of an extraordinary action plan to combat the disease for the years 2015 2017 the plan subsequently approved by the European Commission for its co-financing It is precisely thanks to the continuous checks that last month in the territory of Urzulei in Sardinia forty pigs were killed as they were not registered to the zootechnic registry and without owners and health checks These activities are part of the action to combat the PSA virus which sees the illegal breeding of pigs as one of the most important risk factors for the continuation of the virus in those territories As the European Commissioners pointed out after the mission in 2021 these unregistered pigs constitute the real transmission belt of the virus between the wild population and domestic animals But the measures taken as soon as they were taken have resulted in a total commitment of the entire regional veterinary structure and of the hundreds of wild boar hunters companies which have made a decisive contribution limiting the number of wild animals and providing the findings necessary to assess the spread of the disease In summary the plans provide for the division of the municipalities into red and white hunting areas with requirements concessions and various prohibitions in relation to the cases of PSA possibly certified by the analysis of the findings The teams operating in the red zones had to equip themselves with an onerous aseptic pit for the destruction of the bowels and residues of the slaughter of wild boars and the appreciation of the meat cannot take place without the certified negativity after delivery of the results of the analysis of the findings Yes positive results in a few years PSA in Sardinia has almost completely disappeared The plan of the project unit is continuing with the result that most of the municipalities on the island has become white We therefore look forward with confidence to the European Commission s report which visited the PSA health monitoring chain last November on the basis of their response we can finally call for the end of the pigmeat embargo for Sardinia and for export to be released The current measure will prevent the regions affected from this exhausting ordeal which we have experienced So let us hope that the experience that Sardinia has experienced will contribute in some way to avoiding the mistakes made in the past and that the urgent measures taken by the Government with the suggestions and amendments tabled in the Commissions and arrived in this House can put an end to the spread of this terrible virus
IANNONE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister the measure before us today is the result of a work of unification of several legislative proposals the Brothers of Italy Group had also presented one to the House and the Senate with the aim of reorganizing the system of higher technical education and training also in the light of the objectives of the PNRR which has allocated a considerable amount to this system Higher technical institutes have existed for more than ten years represent training and high technological specialisation are closely integrated with the economic and productive world and have been born to enhance both human capital and the production system of the territories to compensate for the lack of specialised technicians in certain sectors Unfortunately in Italy however this system of higher technical education and training has remained largely unknown as its potential to become a tool to deal more easily with entry into the world of work If we analyse European data it is easy to grasp the delays of our tertiary training system and the lack of attraction towards it considering that only 0.01 of young people between 18 and 25 choose the higher technical institutes for continuing training Often this is little known by students families and teachers in charge of guidance All this is paradoxical in the light of the fact that in Italy youth unemployment is high and this type of direction is to be considered a real fundamental resource It is an important opportunity in order to interact the school community with the business system as it can provide through well calibrated paths an experiential didactic center on direct action and experimentation of the tasks and roles functional to those of the working reality both in terms of knowledge skills and strategies This is in order to address future challenges in a globalised and constantly changing world Moreover according to the latest data 80 of the graduates who chose this path found employment and 90 of them found employment in an area consistent with their own curriculum Therefore the role played by the information and guidance of young people and the communication to families about the nature and potential of this training channel which should not be considered a second choice compared to university is fundamental Another dysfunction that this system has shown is linked to the vision that these institutions must adapt to already defined professional profiles On the other hand there is no idea that they can create new roles new trades and new high quality professions thanks to the extension of further guidelines taking into account the specificity and vocations of our territories In this direction aimed at the expansion of the addresses and the enhancement of Made in Italy the proposal of the Fratelli d'Italia Group went to include itineraries in the ITS also referring to the high artistic craftsmanship which represents a peculiarity of our nation We are pleased with the work done in the Commission and I would of course like to thank President Nencini who is also rapporteur for the measure my colleagues and officials who have demonstrated many times the ability to work in a practical way and on the basis of the measures We have fired many bills in the Commission united by this spirit and we believe that even on this important option which is being put in place there can be a finalization of the large resource that is being destined In fact we are well aware that Italy has an identity heritage in its ability to propose quality of which there is hunger in the world and that it must find an instrument capable of not losing this identity and the possibilities of realization of many young people They must know that there is a real possibility of realization in these areas too and not only in that of intellectual performance I conclude by announcing the positive vote of the Brothers of Italy Group and pointing out that our efforts as always have been to improve the text Our patriotic and never preliminary opposition has always been marked by the proposal and we have fought so that this instrument can have an adherence to the vocations of the territory and the institutions of the same also with reference to the Regions noting also the failure which for the past undoubtedly there has been of a vocational training too often designed for the trainers and not for the formants Minister we hope that this instrument will be a real possibility and in this spirit we shall be voting in favour of the adoption of this measure
Mr President I will only take a few minutes because we are going to have yet another vote of confidence Unfortunately this parliamentary term is beginning to remain historic in the sense that the words of the Head of State in his speech of settlement will remain as an isolated cameo while respecting what should be the role of Parliament And to think that there is n't even an excuse for the emergency state anymore It is clear that what we have seen now has become a sad practice which is consumed on every measure continuous postponements of the sessions Commissions that do not work during the day and then are forced to final sprints at night in confusion when colleagues have difficulty in understanding what they are voting on with a method that tears apart all the regulations and all the parliamentary practices We have tried as patriotic opposition also in this measure and also in this climate to make our contribution to addressing the difficulties of our nation We really pick up very little in terms of listening from the government and the political forces of majority We will insist on the proposals as we are used to doing because we want to make opposition to this Government which shows that months ago we were symbolically right in saying that we cannot give life to defined governments of broad understanding which then become only long awaited governments because on every measure to be undertaken it is clear that there is the need to reach compromises which are unfortunately always downward I would like to focus my speech on Article 36 of this measure with which the posts for the Covid staff of schools have finally been extended This is an untenable necessity which we had supported through an amendment even in previous measures You always get late because it was obvious that our school could n't go on without this staff and we re-launch saying that it wo n't be able to face the new school year without this staff We do not understand why this decision could not already be adopted last month i.e. before those posts came to an end Thousands of people were sentenced to a Dante 's life after serving in the interest of the State and until the last day they did not know if they were to remain in service By the way we are talking about people who live hundreds of miles away from home and their families and who of course had to confirm their rents and all their life commitments We do not understand why they could not be given time and peace of mind by adopting our amendment However we are pleased that the government and the majority have finally convinced themselves and found the resources to do so Those who have experience as local administrators are well aware that school years are preparing well in advance and therefore if we do not want the next school year to start with more and more serious uncertainties we must take certain decisions from now on which we have tried to propose with our amendments to Article 36 We are delighted that the commitment has been made to those eligible for primary school and children but we do not understand in this regard too what method the Commission has followed because in the presence of equal amendments both in the content and in the text those with the worst numbering are approved For us it is not important to place a flag but the form is substance and here at the highest level of the Italian institutions this principle should never be exempted instead it is punctually betrayed and put aside with serious prejudice to the rights of all parliamentarians and in particular of the opposition which legitimately and with a great sense of duty must realize its role of control of the government 's activity Unfortunately this is a practice and the Government self defined of the best is incapable of understanding these elementary dynamics It is also for this reason of course that the union acronyms and the whole world of the school are forced to announce a general strike for the next 30 May If you had listened to our proposals and also those of many other Members of the majority who are obviously disappointed that they were not heard this strike would probably have been averted and above all we could have presented ourselves to the new school year with many more certainties However this is unfortunately a way of acting by the Government and also testifies to the inability of the majority to be heard which is confirmed in all things I am thinking for example of the events of local authorities and of the deadline of 30 April which for a period have been mentioned to extend for the final statements which the municipalities have serious difficulties in presenting Nothing has been done about it and now that the deadline has been exceeded an extension is announced to the next 31 May which is now on its way How do you plan to govern the processes of a nation by extending in a posthumous way deadlines that have already been exceeded and advanced It is evident that this government which is a giant with clay feet waves more and more Then we say to you if you are not able to govern and this experience and this political season have worn out it is better to return the word to the Italians immediately through the elections so that they can choose a majority that gives a legitimate government to our nation PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator Berutti is enlisted to speak You have the right to do so
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen if there were no appreciable circumstances in the serious international framework that has been determined the sad practice of fleeing on Thursday would have been staged today We are in the presence of an omnibus measure by its very nature the milleproroghe which is moving towards a new vow of confidence That is what Mr Zaffini said we will be in front of the fortieth vote of confidence in a year of the Dragons Government which starts to beat all the records tearing even those that we would have considered unsurpassed by the Monti Government The majority renounces about four hours of general discussion Everyone applauded President Mattarella 's speech when he called for respect for Parliament 's prerogatives and among those who applauded there are the same Members who today give up the general debate and who over the past few weeks have also applauded the representatives of the Groups who invited them to give their speech in an explanation of vote If we are not first of all consistent with the role that the people have entrusted to us electing us as their representatives by whom do we want our high function of representing the nation to be respected We must call for respect for Parliament of course but no one can give us respect if we are not able to do it first We continue with the method of urgent decree in many creative cases We are witnessing without the Commissions being able to play their full role We continue in a de facto monocameralism which mortifies on alternate plates one branch or the other of Parliament And we do not understand why Members are not given the power to perform their duties to the full We understand very well that we are in front of a government that is a giant with clay feet This is certified by the fact that the Government has been beaten four times on a thousand pronge in the House Commission This is certified by the fact that last week here in the Chamber the government was beaten three times with a level of continuous confusion We of Brothers of Italy with our leader Giorgia Meloni had said that it is not possible to give life to governmental experiences in which apples are put together with pears When it comes to choosing and deciding according to ideal guidelines and concrete beliefs this is the result a continuous conflict which our nation pays through the mortification of Parliament 's role It is not possible then to see the President of the Council who gets angry and calls everyone from the free exit If the Dragons method of the last year of government were to be that of the permanent threat of resignation in the drawer then dear colleagues the advice is that if there is such a hurry to go home on Thursday it would have been much better to return to the vote The Italians would have satisfied you very gladly In any case just to claim some results that says a lot about our way of understanding the function of opposition also in this provision Brothers of Italy has brought many proposals Some of the majority 's proposals however are proposals that you have rejected on other measures demonstrating that you are also able to subtract with little dexterity what is the work done by others We would like to stress the result that we have achieved with the adoption of an amendment that has raised the cash use ceiling from 1,000 to 2,000 euros This is the only measure that will give some oxygen and the possibility to revive some consumption those consumptions that you have destroyed through the unsavory choice of the use of the green pass a measure that has served absolutely nothing only to limit individual freedoms It has had no real effect from a health point of view but it has been economically devastating In conclusion we are already at the end of the debate although we are at the beginning of the morning 's work everyone lives in his own world but it seems to us that the world does not live in each of us Therefore if you have the opportunity in this last year to demonstrate with a glimmer of dignity and pride that Parliament is not the passcard of the Government"
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen of the Government Mr Calandrini Mr Zaffini and Mr De Bertoldi have already said what the Brothers of Italy think of this measure but let me say having listened carefully to the speeches of colleagues from the other majority groups that the measure does not satisfy anyone The decree law at our examination should have found and given other answers to the areas of life of our nation and instead the government lacks courage The truth is that in order to put in place the resources necessary to give real and effective answers economic commitments of another kind or at least political choices that go in the opposite direction to what the Government has chosen should be assumed a new budgetary deviation We say this with the credibility of those who while being a force of opposition have shown that they are able to vote for this necessity in other times and moments of the pandemic We do not want to help the Government it never convinces us from the first moment but we never back down when we have to help Italy and the Italians I wonder what is the point of an amendment by the majority when one is aware already from the principle that there is no possibility of intervention even on this measure More than 2,300 amendments certify from the outset that we are in the presence of an absolutely insufficient decree-law Then through the perverse I say system of warnings of confrontation monco also in the Commission let us be honest this activity serves only to mock categories and subjects who on the other hand legitimately expect aid from the State These are people who in the pandemic have continued to do their duty with serious difficulties and little changes if the provision is called refreshments or support because you have not changed the philosophy of intervention The minutes I have left I want to dedicate to an issue that as a party we have tried to point out to you in the importance it takes trying to stay at least on the emergency if it is not possible to stand on an overall and strategic vision which is missing In fourteen days on March 31 more than 55,000 people who have sent the Italian school forward will see their contract expire There are fifteen days left and still those people who are serving the state do not know if their duties will be extended We fought with an amendment We had hope that this problem could be resolved so that the Italian school could move forward There are no resources after so much hope had been given and it was said that other political forces had also tabled the same amendment We tell the government we still want to believe it I say this to the Undersecretary Guerra to whom I must acknowledge with intellectual honesty that on other occasions he has given testimony of sensitivity to the problems of the school We are strict but we are also able to be honest intellectually I would like to refer specifically to the question which has allowed with our amendment a shield civil criminal and administrative for school leaders An effort must be made to extend this staff to June 2022 You still do n't promise things you wo n't do or confused solutions kicking the ball forward and telling them you 'll find resources in the DEF to extend by a month until April 30th We give answers to those 55,000 people and their families people who have gone to work even 1,000 miles away Instead of dissipating billions in unproductive income of citizenship and subsidies let us make sure that those who have worked those who work and those who want to continue working in the interest of the State have their own answer"
Mr President ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen for Brothers of Italy sport has never been a B series subject In the electoral program of our party which we had submitted to the voters in 2018 we wrote with our leader Giorgia Meloni that sport had to find this its recognition in the Constitution Today is therefore a happy day but also important The hope is that this process will know its completion Since the first days of the legislature we have devoted ourselves to this bill precisely the Senate Act 747 which I presented together with my colleague Mr Calandrini who did not say so in his speech There is a historical sensitivity of the right on this subject I would like to remind this House that the first to present a bill for the recognition of sport in Constitution was the late Senator Giulio Maceratini Leader of the National Alliance in those years Today we are happy after the excellent work that has been done in my opinion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and I would like to thank President Parrini the rapporteur Mr Grimani and of course also undersecretary Vezzali who in his opinion knows well what this moment represents for a universe of positivity which is our world of sport It is the recognition that must be given to the victories of our champions that excite us and strengthen the sense of belonging to the national community but it is also the recognition to all that world of the basic practice of sport which stubbornly makes sacrifices to achieve those objectives and those goals that all the colleagues who have spoken in this House have stated For these reasons we have the duty to give this world the recognition to which it has longed for years moreover at a time of great difficulty as Mr Calandrini has reminded us in which sudden choices in our opinion have undermined and brought to their knees all those who want to continue to exercise this passion in order to ensure that sport is and continues to be at all times education sociality and health protection through a healthy lifestyle I believe that today 's passage must be dedicated first and foremost to this world that deserves in its entirety with the vow of each one of you to know a new beginning and to be recognized for what it is We are talking about people who represent a great school of life and who make sure that every difference and every barrier falls through sports practice It is a world that keeps many young people away from the deviances and the road and that in many cases represents let me say especially in the South the only positive social outlet that young people have through the culture of sports sacrifice also understand how man is built in life And since examples gestures experience are worth more than so much theory and often rhetoric we think that today we start a process that is going to give credit to that world of sport that thinks its turnover is passion
IANNONE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen as we have already done in the Chamber of Deputies and in the 7th Commission to the Senate I preannounce the positive and convinced vote of Brothers of Italy on the measure under discussion amending Article 142 of the single text of the Royal Decree of 31 August 1933 No 1592 Time passes goes on and the needs of university students change The measure allows university students to enroll in two faculties at the same time We fought in the House of Deputies in our capacity as a modern and responsible opposition which is never against the nation but is able to offer its contribution to improve all measures We welcome the recognition of certain principles which we strongly supported I am referring in particular to two of them First of all it is very important to have included during the examination of the provision in the Chamber the high artistic musical and choreutica AFAM As we have always argued academies and conservatives must have a fundamental recognition as well as universities as well as institutions of high musical and Korean artistic formation This strengthening aimed at increasing the comparability of AFAMs with universities is in our political project that concerns education Then we find the article that deals with the right to study establishing that those who subscribe to two courses at the same time can benefit from the same tools and services provided for a single registration We believe that there is a common sense in avoiding too many burdens in an area where funds as we know are all too often inadequate We also agree very strongly when Article 4 states that it is not possible to enrol in courses which require special application and concentration as in the case of the medical faculty for example It is clear that we have different courses for which special attention is needed to monitor registrations Our concern was that the possibility of enrolling in two courses was all without any difference this would obviously not reward the meritocracy and the seriousness of a study with reference to special courses in which certainly one cannot lose concentration In the light of Article 4 therefore we have basically approved and accepted this amendment according to which the Ministry of the University by decree heard the National University Council CUN and the Conference of the Rectors of Italian Universities CRUI important bodies regarding the university will have to monitor courses that require compulsory attendance This is very important and the agenda that we presented to the House was also closely linked to this speech The vote of the Brothers of Italy Group will be in favour because we believe that this measure offers opportunities to university students and represents another piece to build our university to ensure that young people are no longer forced to emigrate abroad and put their strength and brains at the disposal of our nation
IANNONE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen of the Government I have listened to emphatic words about this measure but sincerely as Senator Maffoni our colleague in the Group and member of the Commission has already announced we believe that this is a missed opportunity to give a fully concrete and incisive response to a world that has been waiting for you for years We are also very sorry because for the umpteenth time the amending proposals of Brothers of Italy which never has a preliminary attitude have been absolutely ignored We had all the intention of making a contribution that would significantly improve the measure which for a long time was blocked in the Commissions in view of the evidence that there were also very obvious political conflicts which culminated when the Government was beaten on an amendment tabled by a majority representative on the delicate issue which we too have been proposing and proposing for years of the supervision of the management of lyrical symphonic foundations The majority have split but this is not a novelty in the light of what is now happening in the usual way in the Commissions However our critical abstention position that we will express does not prevent us as our intellectual honesty on the other hand always allows us from recognizing that the delegation of the show certainly introduces new elements even if not decisive in the precariousness of the workers of the show and in the face of the need to guarantee the cultural sector A limited answer has come I repeat practically Tachipirina and vigilantly awaited to the problems that the Commissions of Chamber and Senate education have had the opportunity to study and deepen in a very exhaustive way Therefore I would like to make a critical point first of merit and then of method moving from the technicality of the more political issues We have tabled amendments for the reform of the Single Fund for performance in the National Arts Fund it is present in Parliament at the first signature of my colleague Mr Mollicone della Camera who is also our head of the Culture Department a bill for the revision of the Single Fund for performance which eliminates in particular the distorting role of consultative commissions as requested by the categories as in the case of the Live Show Movement and promotes the introduction of the deduction of cultural consumption necessary to relaunch the demand for culture that we have proposed several times both to the Chamber and to the Senate in more measures and budget laws The left is always in favour of the deduction of cultural consumption but then never votes for the measure These are issues on which instead Brothers of Italy has always been at the forefront alongside the categories as in the case of Federculture so much so as to include incentives to demand for culture I am thinking of the deduction of cultural consumption and the reduction of VAT to 4 for cultural products in the party 's government program since its foundation We very much welcome the recognition of the profession as a live entertainment agent as well as the strengthening and extension of the functions of the entertainment observatory and the establishment of the permanent table in the entertainment sector the subject of our agenda which was voted on in the Chamber of Deputies It should be pointed out that the delegation as my previous colleague said does not address the live club sector nor does it specify the role of live entertainment as a cultural enterprise Yet despite our common sense amending action the opposition was excluded and remained unheard Colleagues we will abstain critically for the reasons I have explained but we will never be against those who make culture music and show because it represents a very important and fundamental identity reference for our nation
"IANNONE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government we sincerely are not surprised that the Government and the majority are on Mars to which we are now accustomed but that they do not hear the cries coming from the Earth We are dealing with a very complex and important measure which has been reduced to a stew with articles which have practically not been dealt with by this branch of Parliament and with articles modified with downward agreements One thing has been done a politically criminal choice has been made for Brothers of Italy to decree the death of 30,000 Italian companies Our beaches have written a page in the history of our nation and are an excellence of the Italian productive world which has resisted over the years has resisted the pandemic and has resisted the incomprehensible measures that have been enacted by the government even during the period of the pandemic We do n't have to prove which side we 're on We say this with an absolute conviction because it shows what we have done over the years in terms of battles for our beaches I go backwards in 2019 we said that a definitive and clear solution had to be found that would give certainty to these people because going forward with extensions they would be exposed to a serious risk We were unheard and the facts then showed up in all their crudeness So dear gentlemen how can one think of acting in this way in the most absolute contempt for the lives and work of these people However they have been subjected to a press campaign which I do not hesitate to call shameful because they have been painted as scroungers of the State They are people who have worked with honor for many generations who give employment to many people and who offer a service that is considered an Italian excellence to see them painted in this way really offends and mortifies Unfortunately we are well aware of the root of this because we have also listened to unworthy words in this House If the extensions have been made it is certainly not the fault of the beaches but of governments that have not decided of governments supported by some political forces that lose the elections punctually for ten years but are always in the government If these companies paid insufficient fees however they did not determine them themselves the fees were paid on the basis of what they were asked for I would add that this argument is really ridiculous because if we have headaches the solution is not to cut off our heads but to take aspirin So it is not possible to accept that these people are also offended and vile We have always brought the proposals our amendments are always there On this day which is very sad for the Italian beaches there are some things that have definitely ripped a laugh To feel that the blame for this situation lies with the opposition leader Giorgia Meloni is really ridiculous It is also ridiculous to hear this in the light of the fact that Commissioner Bolkestein the father of the directive said in Parliament that the Bolkestein directive does not apply to State concessions So what has been said in this House by the Movimento 5 Stars is a real stupidity but we know it well and even the beaches know it well For them there is always a solution close and there will be citizenship income for you Let 's say that the work must be mortified and penalized because there is this instrument that destroyed the Italian productive fabric Take a tour of the businesses let yourself be told how difficult it is especially in the south to find people who go to work because you have given them state methadone Then before you speak of others shut up listen do not be intolerant of the only force in opposition You have a majority which is before your eyes there are those who think they are Robin Hood and those who think they are the Sheriff of Nottingham Have you listened to the statements of the majority forces There are those who are convinced that they are doing a great thing for the state treasury and those who say we are voting in favour but then we are going to change it It 's embarrassing Then you want to talk about the opposition and allow yourself to name Giorgia Meloni the only coherent tale of Italian politics There is no decency in this House in the absolute way I have heard words that I share for example the criticism of the decision of the Council of State but here we have to be consistent with the vote ladies and gentlemen That sentence is an offense to the whole Parliament not only because it is written with the devil 's hand but because it has allowed itself to go as far as occupying the perimeter of the legislative power which until proven otherwise belongs to this House which belongs to the people In the days of last week in those convulsive hours you were called as schoolchildren by the President in Office of the Council who told you in eight minutes either you do so without even trust otherwise we loose the lines and all at home This is probably because in the next few days it must bring to the European Union as a guarantee of the PNRR the head of the Italian seaside resorts That is the truth and it is a shameful truth because we must stand by what is written there is no such conditionality for the PNRR We are the State we represent the State and the laws we make are only written Whoever makes the laws without writing them and wants them to be respected surreptitiously bears all other names but it is not called State Then I am very sorry that I have also heard from the leader of the League a specious controversy about the amendment but you know well what you have done in the Commission instead of tabling an amendment signed by the rapporteur and the government you have tabled rewordings of your sub-amendments which have precluded our own Do you want to continue voting against Italian bathing PRESIDENT The debate is closed Conclude Senator Iannone IANNONE FdI You could do that because there was the vote that was taken here in this House it was enough to vote no in Article 2 and Article 2 would have been deleted If you still want to be fierce about these people you will have the opportunity to do so in the House of Deputies Let 's see how you vote in the House of Deputies"
IANNONE FdI I should like to conclude Mr President by saying that the government of the best is Monti bis we have also seen this from Mr Monti 's arguments this morning that he said very serious things and that we certainly reject because we have not delegated anything to the Europe of technocrats especially when it is in the hands of the Italians Never something like that It has been said that central banks have been wrong and candidly said that citizens must pay the price Brothers of Italy will never stand for this because ours is not the party that will stay with the beaches tomorrow or that was with the beaches yesterday Brothers of Italy is the party that is with the beaches yesterday today and tomorrow
IANNONE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government I will not dwell on the cultural and evocative power of our cinema this has already been done very well by my previous colleagues to whom I join Today however even with this debate here in the Chamber and in the discussion with the Government we have the opportunity to give a concrete witness to the attention that must be paid to the production of this cultural enterprise which is also a moral work The cinemas as indicated by the National Association of Cinema Exhibitors ANEC have been experiencing a situation of extreme difficulty since February 23 2020 when the entertainment sector was undermined with initial losses of more than 75 80 percent At European level receipts as can be easily seen have fallen by around 61 in Italy compared with 50 in Germany 38 in France 36 in Spain and 19 in the United Kingdom The motion presented by the Fratelli d'Italia Group n. 496 is the response of the patriotic opposition to the crisis of cinemas that arose from the comparison with all categories of the audiovisual sector We need to help cinemas in practice and allow cinemas to win back spectators we support a sector of our cultural industry In our motion we had indicated within a hundred and five days the window of exploitation of films both national and international We must say that thanks to the intercourse with the Government in particular with the Undersecretary Borgonzoni we are satisfied with the wording that is proposed which speaks and I also say this in detail of what President Nencini said of at least ninety days For us it is an important moment for the transposition of a wait In the same way we believe it is important that the Government has expressed a favourable opinion on another set of points summarized in the commitments of our motion and that they can certainly represent the polar star for the regulatory activity that must be put in place if we want to intervene concretely in support of this world I should like to mention many of the commitments that we consider to be fundamental on which we have been given a favourable opinion but unfortunately the limited time limits do not allow us to enter specifically and so I preferred to deal with the nodal aspect of the windows In any case Brothers of Italy will vote in favour of the motion that he presented and all the others because the moment of fall and meeting that there was certainly represents an important starting point for protecting this world
IANNONE FdI Mr President we are truly shocked at the way the work is taking place because for a week now three Commissions the 1st the 5th and the 7th have practically been seized by the divisions of the majority We express an extreme concern about such an important measure as we are going to examine which will certainly be fired with the confidence of this House and run the risk that even the House will have to work on the weekend to meet the deadline It really seems to us to be extremely serious that such a far reaching measure on which so much political attention has been drawn is seeing an unprecedented development We have seen so many in the current parliamentary term but what is now being consumed has really gone beyond the loss of dignity of this House and of Parliament 's institution
Mr President in fact with regard to what we said at the time of the first passage of the measure in the Senate I would like to express my satisfaction with the Presidency and all the parliamentary groups for the prompt timing of the measure under consideration precisely at the end of the three months This indicates that there is obviously a strong awareness in all political forces that this amendment to the Constitution with the recognition of sporting activity in all its forms can give the sporting world the dignity it deserves In our view the dictation is clear but of course we are sure that the Presidency will be able to clear up precisely on the issue of not less than three months time In any case it seems to us a highly qualified moment in this Parliament to give the possibility to the constitutional change under consideration to know its light That of sport is a world that represents the best story in our opinion of our nation because as we have had the opportunity to reiterate also with the undersecretary Vezzali on the occasion of a demonstration held at the CONI has given our homeland a lustre for which we must be grateful We must also be aware of the fact that sports practice has a social reverberation of extreme positivity in all its aspects because sport represents for all Italian citizens of every age group especially for our young people a positive model that transmits values that today there is an infinite need Sport is also the best tool for social inclusion erases differences promotes the culture of merit and sacrifice breaks down differences and barriers and represents a metaphor of life in which everyone starts from the same starting point but then the best must go and go further We have always felt that sport should be recognised in the Constitution It is a historical fact that goes beyond this parliamentary term I would like to remind you once again that the first draft constitutional amendment that provided for this recognition was by the leader of Alleanza Nazionale the late Giulio Maceratini in 1996 We are not interested in placing a flag but in the political program of Brothers of Italy our leader Giorgia Meloni wanted expressly to include this point as a qualification of our political proposal on sport Therefore as early as August 2018 a few months after the beginning of the current legislature I presented draft law n. 747 We are delighted that there is this determination on the part of the whole of Parliament We are very happy with the interlocutions that have been made in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the definition that has been found Our draft law provided for a link to Article 32 of the Constitution because we believed that health protection was the main issue But we are also very satisfied with the work that has been done and I would like to thank the Undersecretary Vezzali for the work he has done I am convinced and hope there are all the prerequisites that we can all achieve together in the current legislature this great goal that renders justice to a world that with its turnover of passion represents Italy 's commitment sacrifice and merit
IANNONE FdI Mr President we are now out of line Last week we had three Commissions practically seized for days and days now as you have well retraced we have been working not for the citizens for a whole afternoon but waiting for the government 's referrals which is not even present and for the majority It seems to us that as opposition we have been all too responsible and patient President I call the Group of the European People 's Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats Then as you rightly said to President Pesco if at 10 p.m. we are certain that we are in a position to work and proceed well otherwise we cannot think of giving dignity to this House if we do not give dignity to ourselves I say this to protect all colleagues of majority and opposition We have also gathered the bitter outpouring of the rapporteur Senator Cangini whom I personally greatly appreciated for intellectual honesty The government and the majority tell us clearly and peremptoryly since we can no longer accept this behavior if at 10 p.m. we will be in a position to proceed with the work That 's enough President Pesco that 's not possible
IANNONE FdI Mr President we are witnessing yet another vote of confidence and Brothers of Italy for the umpteenth time will say no to this Government which seems more and more like a mad mayonnaise I say this because together with my colleagues Senator Malan and Senator Barbaro as well as my colleagues from the 5th Commission Senators Calandrini and De Carlo we have from the beginning placed ourselves against this measure with an attitude of extreme seriousness and responsibility in the awareness of what it could and should represent for our nation We are talking about urgent measures for the implementation of the PNRR Well if good morning is seen from the morning first there has been this troubled experience that we have experienced in the Commissions I repeat a kidnapping for whole days During the day there were continuous delays and at night we tried to recover the lost time for a clear lack of homogeneous vision within the majority and lack of relationship with the government I turn to President Nencini whom I will never lack respect and human esteem who knows how to be sincere in thanking him together with the rapporteur Mr Cangini and the Undersecretary Bini for the human availability which has never failed in the confrontation I would add however that frankly we feel that we are listening to Swedish tourists who are visiting Parliament who disassociate themselves from their choices since in the near future we will see a vote of confidence where all those critics will vote in favour of trust I would remind you that we have listened to virtually all the parties from the general debate to the explanations of vote so far to complain and criticize rightly the way in which the work has been done and also the merit of the measure as it has been dealt with and for what comes out of it I would like to express solidarity with my colleagues in the majority for the obvious short circuit that there has been with the Government but even more so with the Italian citizens who have to attend this authentic theater in which we recognize all the limit of the work done and then the conclusion remains the exact reverse I believe that this is mortifying for political stories that deserve much more dignity but unfortunately our leader Giorgia Meloni was right in saying that this Government and this majority are not together so there can be no other result except what every day becomes more evident We have tried in every way to help achieve the ultimate result and for intellectual honesty I must also respond to certain amendments which have been adopted in a dry way to others which have been absorbed by other amendments or in any case of content which have been transposed The rapporteurs and Presidents of the Commission are well aware that those amendments did not represent the priorities that Brothers of Italy had indicated In any case we believe that we have been more useful to the majority than the majority have been useful to us but this is the attitude that Brothers of Italy has taken from the first moment because we are consistent with the opposition of the Government but we will never play the worst so much better towards our homeland We have proposed amendments to help municipalities and provinces Those who have been local administrator know well that some municipalities have difficulty finding even the secretaries general and some Provinces after the Delrio reform which many have voted that many criticize and that many want to dismantle without succeed are ghost entities They are like Totò 's fog in Milan they are there but they are not visible After emptying them of their human capital do we think that these entities that want to accept the challenge of the PNRR can conclude something positive We have tried to support the proposals that came to us from the Italian National Association of Municipalities ANCI and the Union of Provinces of Italy UPI from those administrators who are of all political parties and who share a condition of extreme difficulty in which every day they are forced to say with facts and words I wish but I cannot One chapter of the measure is dedicated to the school and was the final rock In my opinion the mistake was in the beginning We also talked about this with the Minister and with President Nencini to whom I wish to bear witness to institutional culture because about a month ago they had the kindness to intervene in the initiative that we had promoted of the general states of the school and we had received an openness that we wanted to believe because it seemed important to us I must say that what emerges is very disappointing because the priority that we identify that is the stabilisation of our precarious staff of the school once again does not find its fulfillment This government is concerned not to incur a European infringement procedure in relation to our beaches condemning them to death when instead we are already in infringement procedure for our teachers who are not stabilized It is then clear that we see the reality we want and above all it is not a discovery today that politics has abdicated the role of choosing deciding and taking responsibility for the technostructures that have been raging for too long Maybe you 're waking up too late compared to this reality If we do not give respect for our role first who should give it to us What is the use of elections when it is allowed since we have been waiting for years to return to the polls and see the succession of governments that are built in vitro if then the story is made by the General Accounting of the State This is what citizens do not understand in terms of the role of politics Mr President I am beginning to conclude without lingering in so many other matters Too many times we read in the press x-rays to the ruling class of Brothers of Italy more or less ready to the challenge of government I believe that if these reporters had listened carefully to the work as they have been doing these days they would have had to review their judgment a great deal We humbly and with the knowledge that we will also have to remedy the further rubble that you have left in this five year period but we are sure not to end this mad mayonnaise with many who are born incendiary and are dying firemen with people who started with Rousseau and will end with Tabacci
"IANNONE FdI Mr President Brothers of Italy can only confirm his vote against the measure under consideration which was characterized by an institutional stew troubled articles approved in the Senate others approved in the Chamber excerpts and a concept of competition in reality much closer to that of sale a sale to the detriment of Italian work of those people who every day do their duty to bring the bread home and who work without guarantees only by the force of their professionalism and who obviously the Government and the majority have not been able to safeguard in the measure under discussion For this reason we have voted against it in a convincing way here in the Senate then in the Chamber and we will do it again today as we have already done on all the articles because for Brothers of Italy the defence of Italian work is a priority and a possibility that does not allow compromises The bill contains general claims that even support competition for professionals Does it mean that you want to abolish professional orders that you want to decimate our professionals that you want to continue in that evil project of the so called Bersani sheets to proletarianize the liberal professions with a serious damage in terms of guarantee for customers There are also the shameful auctions both as regards hydropower and for our beaches We have made a commitment we have consistently fought alongside them but we want to project this commitment in the next parliamentary term because we are convinced that this bill contains a very serious injustice If we have heard from the father of the Bolkestein directive that it does not apply to state property concessions because it concerns services we do not understand why the government has gone on to the end towards these people and these 30,000 Italian companies that give jobs to so many people and that represent a story of excellence of our nation To see them treated in this way truly indignant We have hoped until the end for a rethink we have always been present with our amendments even at the time of the European delegation law because we believe that these people should have a different perspective as we say since the adoption of the budget law in 2019 People who have made investments cannot be seen expropriated in this way of the work they have done with dignity and honor for so many years We have also witnessed a press campaign against them in which they have been painted as scroungers of the state because according to some they pay poor canons To these people I would like to remind you that the Italian beaches did not determine their fees themselves but they paid exactly what the State asked them to do This story this rhetoric is not acceptable in order to arouse indignation and social envy It is true that unfortunately in recent years we have witnessed an action of some political forces that have founded their claim of consent only on this generating envy and division towards the Italian social body In these last days of Pompeii I believe that many have the conviction that we have reached the end of the line In the new legislature we will have to remedy the many distortions that have taken place in the various measures but in particular those which have taken place in this measure No to Bolkestein no to the expropriation of Italian work no to auctions this represents for us a moloch a very precise commitment which after the judgment of September 25 will continue to represent one of the highest priorities of Brothers of Italy in the reaffirmation of the value for which in a meritorious society we all start from the same point but those who are better at sacrificing themselves must go further and reap the fruit of their work The solution is not cannot and must not be the income of citizenship Those who expropriate will be expropriated and on September 26 we will have the basis for a new government led by our leader Giorgia Meloni that puts hand to the real reforms of the country and not to those demanded under the dictation of the interests of the multinationals and of all those powers that want to make the people weak and humiliate those who instead did and want to continue to do their work For this reason I announce the vote against the Brothers of Italy Group"
IANNONE FdI Mr President I rise to vote in favour of this measure by the Brothers of Italy Group which has already spoken in a positive way in the Commission The Teatro Regio of Parma represents a part of that heritage of our nation that identifies it as the most beautiful and rich in the world The Commission for Public Education Cultural Heritage led by President Nencini has demonstrated in these years of legislature that it has the capacity to recognize itself and find itself regardless of political belongings when the centre is placed the identity value of our culture Just as on other occasions I think of the measures on Pistoia Blues Festival at the first signature of our Senator La Pietra and on the Arch of Traiano di Benevento Brothers of Italy confirms its sensitivity and ability albeit a force of opposition to this Government to never be opposed to the interest of Italians and to the valorization of the identities of our territories that all together contribute to represent our nation a nation that despite everything still represents a point of reference especially for culture at world level I would like to thank the rapporteur and the proposer Mr Saponara I am sure that on many other initiatives there will be the same spirit aimed at the affirmation of a principle that for us is perennial and immutable beauty is a fragment of eternity that helps us to live For these reasons I repeat that the vote of the Brothers of Italy Group on this measure will be in favour
"Mr President this law of European delegation gives us the opportunity to return to an issue that is dear to us and which represents an injustice to the Italians that we cannot accept If everyone has now thrown the sponge on the issue of Italian bathing Brothers of Italy has no intention of doing so As we have committed ourselves to the competition measure we will table our amendments on every measure that will give us the opportunity on the ground to do so because for us the expropriation of Italian work represents an intolerable activity by the Government and the majority For this reason we have also tabled an amendment to this measure at the first signature of Senator Fazzolari which will speak in an explanation of vote but signed by all the Senators members of the Group of Brothers of Italy to ask the Government to have a rethink on this matter and to make a serious effort to ensure that Italy is not committed a self proclaimed wrong because if the father of the directive Commissioner Bolkestein said that it does not apply to State concessions we do not understand why the Government and those who claim it want to be more realistic than the king It could be assumed that we are faced with an activity deliberately aimed at penalising the work of these people who for years have written a valuable history of Italian production that envys us the whole world and that has remained after the competition decree truly unarmed in not being represented after being illusory by so many political forces We will consistently continue to interpret the line we have married from the first moment saying no to the Bolkestein directive no to the expropriation of Italian work and ensuring that you have to pronounce every time there is the possibility until the end of this legislature Last time in fact we also witnessed a quirky controversy according to which we did not retable in this House the amendment that had been rejected in the Commission Well we have also tabled Amendment 20.0.4 to this law you have already rejected it in the Commission we will see in a few hours how you are going to decide again on this matter It makes you smile to hear that a result has been achieved and then in the new legislature we will see Those who think of it as the Italian beaches have the duty to decide today on this matter because these people their families their employees their customers cannot be treated in this way to be literally vile as happened even with a shameful press campaign evidently financed by those economic powers that want to benefit from this expropriation We 've heard that these people were scroungers on the back of the state who paid poor canons But who set the fees for them but the state There are political forces that claim that these people pay just 100 million euros of concessions for a turnover of about 14 billion forgetting to say that on those 14 million they pay taxes VAT so it is not only the fees but also all that is paid to the State in terms of taxes And anyway if the fees are low the solution is not to take the beaches off our beaches to give them to the multinationals It is not acceptable what happened in terms of political decision in the absence of a serious mapping of our property It is not possible to think that history ends here in this way without caring for the fate of 30,000 enterprises and of everything they have represented they represent and can represent for our nation Brothers of Italy as our leader Giorgia Meloni teaches us every day is the party of the homeland Everywhere there is an Italian who suffers an injustice and here is more than one we feel the duty to fight this battle to the end We also hope that the reason as well as the sentiment of those in this House who are to represent the people will arise Some of my previous colleagues have said that Community law cannot strangle our national sovereignty It seems to me that in the case of our beaches it was we who took the noose and stuck it around our necks otherwise we do not explain the completely different attitude that is reserved for other European realities such as Spain and Portugal for which there is no problem with the Bolkestein directive which at all costs is intended to apply to our beaches first but we fear that the turn of other categories will also come Brothers of Italy will always and in any case oppose the principle of defending Italian work"
Mr President I rise to explain Amendment 20.0.4 which was first signed by Senator Fazzolari
"IANNONE FdI Mr President thank you As I have anticipated in general discussion with this amendment signed by Senator Fazzolari first of all but with all the signatures of the Group of Senators of Brothers of Italy we hope to reconsider the issue of our beaches I do n't want to be repetitive compared to what I said in general discussion but I have read in the words of Senator Mallegni and other senators of the center right and not only a new consciousness of what can be written in terms of history for these 30,000 businesses their family members and their employees I therefore call on all Members of this House to ensure that this amendment can obtain a positive vote that gives the Government recognition of the principle that the Bolkestein directive as the father of the directive Commissioner Bolkestein does not apply to State concessions We hope that Parliament 's own role will be proud and interpreted not in terms of revenge on the angeries that the government has had in recent days on Parliament 's prerogatives but above all in terms of defence and protection of Italian work which must not be expropriated"
"SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister and members of the Government a few days ago I had the honour of participating in my city Parma in the award of the new titles of masters of work by the National Federation of Labour Masters The thing that struck me most during the event in addition to the variety of professionalism awarded was the illustration of the projects that the Federation itself has developed and is carrying on from primary school to maturity with the aim of promoting the inclusion of young levers in the world of work helping them in their training and professional choices These projects are modulated and differentiated according to the order and degree of school at the end of which students are asked to express their experience and expectations Precisely in one of these comments it was written that children 's dreams should be recognized and transformed into interests and passions so that constancy desire and abilities have a way of being born in the person and of feeding themselves over time until becoming a profession It has made me think a lot about the responsibility we have as legislators in stimulating and accompanying young people towards cultural and vocational training choices that really reflect their skills and aspirations a responsibility that goes hand in hand with an appropriate organization and functioning of education and training institutions at all levels and at all levels from primary to secondary school from humanistic to mathematical scientific and professional This responsibility is all the more accentuated by the fact that school and the whole education system are at a time of great change from the educational point of view and also of adapting to the needs of the work sector In this context ITS play an important role whose redefinition of the mission and organisation has been called for in implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and has been entrusted with a bill of parliamentary initiative at second reading here in the Senate and today under discussion in this House To illustrate why ITS play an important role in the context of the education system it is worth remembering that when we talk about ITS we refer to higher post graduate courses which offer highly qualified technical training to enter the world of work immediately The ITS courses in fact are carried out in collaboration with companies universities research centres and local authorities to develop new skills in technological areas considered strategic for the economic development and competitiveness of the country The ITS therefore constitute the segment of tertiary non-university training which responds to the demand of the enterprises of new and high technical and technological skills to promote the processes of innovation and represent an opportunity of absolute importance in the Italian educational landscape as an expression of a new strategy based on the connection of education training and work policies with industrial policies with the objective of supporting the interventions destined to the productive sectors with particular reference to the needs of innovation and technological transformation of small and medium sized enterprises Six of the technological areas concerned to which courses can be accessed after a pre-selection after the diploma of upper secondary education courses normally divided into four semesters which can be up to six which allow you to have an experience in internship in the company During this period of vocational training students have the opportunity to experiment directly on the ground with the skills acquired and to contribute to the development of the processes of business digitisation thanks to the knowledge and innovative dynamics proper to the superior technicians It is clear therefore that ITS courses are built through a shared and shared design by all stakeholders and not least are co-financed by the European Social Fund 's regional operational programme That of ITS is therefore an alternative path to university ones which responds to the vocation and desire of all those girls and all those boys who want to specialize in specific areas and who can transform children 's dreams into high level professionalism and become competitive adults and realized in the world of work not only at national level but also at European level and why not also at international level As legislators therefore given the importance that ITS have we have the task of ensuring that the system works and is efficient During the work of the Commission thanks to the hearings and the continuous and intense interlocations with the Regions and the associations of category we think we have done a good job and today with the approval of this Assembly we return to the House a bill enriched with new elements thanks to the contribution of the amendments and proposals also of the League Group And I would remind you that some of these proposals have been included in the rapporteur 's amendments which I thank and others accepted individually such as the one which excludes the teaching director from being chosen from among the school managers of the secondary schools of second degree members of the foundation and that representatives of the school directors of the secondary schools of second degree members of the foundation are legally involved in the scientific committee a first signed amendment by Senator Alessandrini and shared by Senators Pittoni and Saponara He regretted the failure to accept the amendment at my first signature but always shared by the Lega Group which was not accepted by the Government which provided for the participation of the employers in the ITS committee We are aware that the lack of acceptance of certain requests may give rise to some bad moods But what we have tried to ensure is that the system can be spread throughout the national territory supported by adequate professionalism and subject to a control that ensures its efficiency and guarantees the real specialization as well as the integration in the world of work of girls and boys who will choose ITS to transform their dreams of children Only to give a few numbers there are 120 ITS on the national territory related to six technological areas To give an idea most of the ITS is located in Lombardy which has 20 follow Sicily 11 Tuscany Calabria and Campania 9 Lazio 8 Emilia Romagna Piedmont and Veneto 7 Puglia and Liguria 6 Abruzzo and Sardinia 5 the Marches and Friuli Venezia Giulia 4 but only one foundation is present in Molise Umbria and Basilicata Emilia -Romagna Piedmont and Lombardy are the Regions that in addition have all ITS in all technological areas The currently active routes are 60 still in Emilia Romagna 701 members and just to give a number the total number of graduates of the completed and monitored routes is 2,290 with 1,841 employed Which means ITS is a good solution for professionalism Convinced therefore of the important function of ITS and that the bill so varied can ensure an adequate and efficient functioning the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will vote in favour Thanks go to the President of the Commission the rapporteurs and all the Commissioners"
SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen when we think of Giacomo Matteotti we think of a free man a politician who was not afraid to denounce fraud and fascist violence during the April 1924 elections paying for this act of courage with his own life At the end of the famous speech given to the Chamber of Deputies in May of the same year the politician was aware that that courage would lead him to die and it was precisely so The secretary of the then United Socialist Party will be kidnapped and found dead on August 16 in a forest about thirty kilometers north of the capital Kill me too but the idea that is in me you will never kill her these were the words spoken by Giacomo Matteotti in the last speech to the Chamber words that animated and gave strength to the powerful desire for freedom of the opponents of fascism so much so that during the Resistance the Socialist Party will constitute the Matteotti brigades in which he participated as leader Sandro Pertini The example that Giacomo Matteotti left to the next generations was very powerful For this reason it is important to continue to remember his actions and his thought so as not to disperse his inheritance The bill of celebration has not only a historical value but also helps to keep alive the memory of a fundamental figure in Italian political life but above all an emblem of freedom Of freedom unfortunately one appreciates the importance only when one loses it otherwise one takes it for granted as a work of art that by virtue of having it before his eyes is not appreciated In recent years our freedom has been severely put to the test first by the pandemic which has locked us in the house and then has forbidden us any social and even work activities now by the war in Ukraine which makes us witness impotent overwhelmment among peoples even on live television An infamous war that kills women and children and leaves everything around the desert of destruction while we are forced to hear truths of convenience in countries where it is impossible to express one 's own free thought It is an almost unreal and incomprehensible situation if one thinks of all the initiatives promoted after the last world war so that certain things do not happen again so that the memory of heinous facts and history teach us not to decay into war and violence anymore The content of this bill must also be a warning to us not to fall into the same mistakes not to stifle the freedom of others This is why today it is very important and necessary to continue to keep alive the memory of figures like that of Giacomo Matteotti a giant of freedom that fought against the violence and the overpowering dictatorship so that the new generations but also we could live without being oppressed by power and fully savour the scent of freedom I thank the proposer of this bill the President of the 7th Commission all the signatories and all the members of the Commission and with this announcement the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group vote in favour
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government I would like to say first of all that it is a pleasure to finally speak without a mask I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Senator Tatjana Rojc and Senator Andrea Cangini the Presidents of the two Contact Committees 1a and 7a respectively Senator Dario Parrini and Senator Riccardo Nencini as well as of course all the officials of the legislative offices of both the parliamentary groups and the committees involved Mr President I wanted to thank all my fellow Senators of Commissions 1a and 7a for saying that the work on this decree law was largely and responsibly followed by all the political forces of the parliamentary majority with the only common objective of concluding it within the necessary time in order to avoid its decadence despite having very close times there was therefore this danger with the risk of not respecting the deadline of 30 June linked to the PNRR for the provision of a tranche of funds allocated to our country in the context of the Next generation EU equal to 24 billion In addition to this premise it must be remembered and fixed in the minds of everyone who has been allocated around 190 billion euros in the framework of the PNRR to Italy between loans and grants that are not provided in a single solution but in successive instalments and subordinate to compliance with a strict roadmap which provides for every intervention contained in the PNRR the respect of some deadlines that translate in short into a series of new regulations and reforms that ask us Europe If we want to say that in other words Europe lends us money more simply but we must do as Europe tells us and according to its guidelines Having said that the subject of the Decree Law which contains urgent measures for the implementation of the PNRR is clear In all there are 50 articles covering all sectors with a substantial part relating to the reform of the school which by common agreement between all the majority forces has decided to examine in an unusual way the political affiliations putting aside the shared objectives to be achieved in order to remedy the distortions which already in informal meetings prior to the approval of the measure in the Council of Ministers such as 7a The Commission had made it abundantly clear however that the matter was dealt with in a separate decree law When we did not listen we took into account the situation convinced first of all that the reform of the school contained in Articles 44 45 46 and 47 of the decree law in question could not be based on the denatality providing for the cutting of 10,000 teachers but rather should be based on the words spoken by the President of the Council on the occasion of his installation when he said that it is necessary to invest in the training of the teaching staff in order to align the educational supply to the demand of the new generations We add that this applies to all categories of teachers putting fresh resources and not as required by the decree law going to find the resources for the payment of the tutors of the internship and the training in entry subtracting them from the teaching card but with specific funding of the state budget There is no question of covering the costs of financing the training incentive fund through rationalization which means reducing the legal staff starting from the school year in 2026 2027 with particular reference to the annual quota of the staff posts for upgrading based on the fact that if there is a denatality there will be a need for a smaller number of teachers A distorted way in our opinion to understand a reform that on the contrary should give all teachers who have been working in the school for years the same opportunities to form and enable themselves without being deprived of the instrument that allows their training i.e. the teacher card On this the parliamentary majority was unshakable and in the numerous meetings not least that of yesterday morning we continued to affirm the need to correct what the Government provided for in the decree until the clash with the Government itself The government for its part has been solid in affirming that Europe wants reform in this way and that it cannot be done otherwise until we feel even that we bear the responsibility of a shortage in the coffers of the state if we had made the decree lapse resulting in no disbursement of the planned tranche of 24 billion We have come to the end only for a few hours and after countless meetings and negotiations with the Government to a compromise succeeding first of all to avoid the cut of 10,000 places of reinforcement to insert fresh resources for training to not cut the teacher card with the assurance that it will be guaranteed in a structural way by the budget law Improvement agreements to the government text which were approved in the Commission also include access for the first three cycles of the initial training course of those who are in service in the school state or equal within the limits of the reserve of the places indicated the remission to national bargaining of the incentive the return to the beehive of the negotiation of the definition of the number of additional hours access to specialization on support for those who have already carried out three years of activity It is regrettable that thousands of precarious people have been unable to secure a certain future that they have assured the survival of the school system for years and that they have not been able to qualify for the lack of training courses for nine years This is why enabling pathways should have been provided for all categories of teachers Moreover it was necessary to provide for a longer transitional phase in order to absorb the historical precariousness since in 2024 certainly it will not be done in time and moreover to the precarious ones a pre-elective test will have to be administered Finally it would have been useful also to reopen the merit rankings of the eligible in the competitions In summary we have had results but with great difficulty I would also like to point out that beyond the so called school package on which we have all agreed and which mainly committed the 7th Commission with regard to the rest of the article I have unfortunately seen reluctantly a disparity in the treatment of the amendments proposed according to the various political groups It is not difficult to verify from a table that we have taken the trouble to compile as while some political groups have accepted amendments even considerably burdensome for others it has not been so For example ours which had few amendments accepted and also not burdensome I 'd like the government to explain this to us In conclusion Mr President for our part that is by the parliamentary majority there has been a great deal of responsibility demonstrated precisely by the fact that we have been able to abandon our flagship proposals in order to achieve the objectives In this majority the League continues to play its part responsibly and purposefully and is demonstrating this widely In view of this Mr President I would like the Government to be equally responsible and ready to accept and defend the demands of Italian citizens in the face of Europe I would like the government not to bow passively to the demands of a Europe which looks coldly and detachedly at the Italian people concerned only with systematically planning society Italy with its citizens deserves detailed attention because its specificities and its peculiarities have made it a great country Mr President gentlemen of the Government it is a matter of dignity and we do not want to lose it"
SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to thank the Minister for the presence and constant involvement of Parliament Thank you too for your presence to our secretary Ladies and gentlemen I am very happy today because in recent times every time a debate on students has been held it has been to impose various restrictions on them caused by the fight against the pandemic Today however with pleasure we can say that we turn to the students with an opening order which abolishes the prohibition of contemporary enrolment at two different universities It is therefore beyond an obsolete provision of nearly 90 years ago a royal decree of 1933 which as the previous speaker has already told me provided for this prohibition In this regard the League was among the first to submit a legislative proposal to amend this rule After this last passage to the Senate we hope that from next academic year every student can enroll at the same time in two different courses of degree master 's degree and master 's degree also at several universities schools and higher institutes under special order institutions of high artistic formation musical and choreutica This opportunity has long been demanded by students professors academics and the world of work who trusted in a system that focused on the interdisciplinaryity of knowledge to create professional figures that would respond more adequately to the increasing complexity of the world of work With the overcoming of the logic of specialization in a single sector not only does our country align itself with most European countries but it offers students the concrete opportunity to make their training more flexible In addition with regard to post graduate and post graduate three year guidance the measure will allow students not to lose a year for having made a choice of wrong or hasty studies Now the Minister of University and Research will have to regulate the modalities for the simultaneous registration the conditions for obtaining double or joint final qualifications between Italian and foreign universities as well as the modalities for the simultaneous registration of two different university courses with access to a number programmed at national level We hope that the deadlines set for starting next year will be respected in the best way possible and that there will be no short circuits in the practical application of the rules and their coordination Another important innovation introduced by this bill will be the implementation of the student 's electronic file It is a fundamental tool that will allow access through the public digital identity system SPID or the electronic identity document to all documents of the career of each student in order to ensure transparency and ensure an effective simplification of every bureaucratic practice especially when it is necessary to dialogue with several Italian and foreign faculties and universities We therefore consider it very important to have provided for mechanisms in this text which also allow economically disadvantaged students to have access to double enrolment in order to guarantee students who are capable and worthy even if they lack the means the right to reach the highest degrees of their studies providing for instruments capable of making this right effective 17.28 Following SAPONARA Moreover it has obviously been corrected to provide that the student who is enrolled at the same time as two courses applies the total or partial exemption of the payment of the annual all inclusive contribution for both enrolments This measure is a way of promoting and promoting interdisciplinary learning with a view to accessing less sectoral and distinct knowledge facilitating the interconnection between the scientific and humanistic sectors a fact that will necessarily involve a revision of the educational systems of universities precisely in order to provide for less rigidity and the development of greater interdisciplinaryity Madam Minister these days I have received several e-mails from students who asked when the measure under consideration would be passed so today we give these young people the opportunity to form themselves The draft law under consideration is an encouragement precisely to give our young people the opportunity to learn those disciplines that will allow them to enter the world of work in an appropriate and also competitive way In conclusion with the approval of this measure we also take a further step towards the implementation of our tertiary education system and of what has been planned for a long time in many European countries Trusting that the entire Shareholders Meeting shares this text I announce the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group
SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister what we are debating here today is a very long awaited measure by the entertainment industry which is a sector which has been severely hampered by the pandemic and which is why it has received a great deal of attention from the members of the 7th Commission In fact it is after holding several hearings of the representatives of the sector precisely during the saddest period of the pandemic that the Committee on Culture decided to intervene in order to draw up legislation that the world of entertainment had been waiting for a long time in order to guarantee the right protection for a sector that has always lacked in safeguarding workers rights and also for this reason brought to its knees during the closing of the theatres and cinemas It has been since April last year that the Committees culture and work in joint session have gone to deepen a series of problems to be solved with the aim of giving a certain order and a fair protection to the workers of the show from the recognition of the professional figure of the artist to the more strictly contractual issues from the compensations to the discipline for a social security and insurance protection These are all themes highlighted in the various draft laws presented in the Commission on the subject with the aim of obtaining a unified text that would respond to the various needs highlighted by the workers of the show needs to which also the League with a draft law at the first signature of Senator Lucia Borgonzoni today Undersecretary for Culture has tried to give answers At the same time the Government has also moved so much so that in August again last year was assigned to the two Joint Commissions culture and work the bill delegates for the reorganization of the provisions in the matter of entertainment text related to the budget law As members of the Commissions we immediately began to examine the text that came to us from the Government in order to improve it and make those changes that fulfilled the commitments made with the workers of the show thus trying to introduce through amending proposals some of the norms contained in the bill of parliamentary initiative and in our opinion important This has been a long job which has committed us several months and to conclude that we have waited for the budget law and I will say why We have finally arrived today at the debate in the Chamber of the bill proposed by the Government which provides among other things the following news the reopening of the delegation to the Government in the matter of reordering the laws and regulations in force in the matter of entertainment the delegations to the Government for the reordering and revision of the shock absorbers and allowances for the introduction of an allowance of discontinuity as permanent structural allowance and for employment contracts as well as for the fair compensation for the self employed There will also be recognition of the profession of live entertainment agent the strengthening and expansion of the entertainment observatory and the establishment very important and awaited of the permanent table of the entertainment sector The draft law also provides for the establishment of the national register of performing workers In addition the INPS provides for specific information and communication services in favour of members of the entertainment workers pension fund in order to facilitate access to telematic services and services It is precisely with regard to the discontinuity allowance one of the rapporteurs amendments that there has been wide convergence of the members of the Commission The objective of this measure already present in the text of the League is to recognize the specific discontinuous nature of the creative professions The breaks allowance in fact recognizes the times of preparation training and study as integral parts of the actual working time because they are natural and indispensable for those who carry out a work in the performing arts This economic support was among the most discussed issues and for it the budget law was expected in order to understand what coverage was really possible We are aware that much more money would have been needed for this measure for which some 40 million are currently available In our opinion more could have been done since the National Insurance and Assistance Board ENPALS absorbed by the INPS were active every year as is apparent from a hearing in the Chamber 's meeting Commissions VII and XI of 11 November 2020 during which Professor Pasquale Tridico President of the INPS had stated that The pension expenditure remains lower than the contribution Hence a surplus that is generated from year to year for about 300 million up to a cumulative to date of approximately 5.4 billion Of course in the national accounting system the capital surplus of the entertainment workers pension fund helps to finance social security schemes in other sectors of production with deficit conditions I would like to stress starting with the conclusion of my speech that during the whole process of the measure under consideration the Lega Group shared and supported the amendments of the rapporteurs and that some of the amendments of the Lega Group were accepted which proposed the shortening of the delegation time from twelve to nine months at my signature and the possibility of carrying out training internships with professionals in the fashion and entertainment sector in favour of young people who have obtained a diploma in higher secondary education at professional institutions with cultural services and entertainment signed by Senator Alessandrini In addition Senator Rufa 's agenda was accepted which commits the Government to specify that the contribution obligation for wearers and photo models exists only and exclusively in the event that such professionals participate in events with an actual character of spectacularity and perform artistic activities directly related to the production and realization of the show In conclusion today we are going to vote on a measure which while not completely resolving all the problems relating to the entertainment sector we think has achieved an important result and content The favorable vote that also the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will give to the measure is also supported in the statements of some associations of the live show such as Assomusica who appreciated the improvements made by the Commissions regarding the issue of the construction of a first universal welfare for the workers of the supply chain and the recognition of the live clubs within the sector This delegation revives Law No. 175 of 2017 approved at the end of the last parliamentary term but unfortunately not implemented I thank the Ministers in particular Minister Franceschini who is present today the rapporteurs Senator Roberto Rampi and Senator Nunzia Catalfo the Presidents of the Commissions 7a and 11a the Commissioners for the shared work to achieve this result Of course I also thank Senator Lucia Borgonzoni State Secretary for Culture who has followed us with attention and passion throughout the journey for the importance and centrality of the workers of the entertainment world who deserve the right recognition Minister our country is great and recognized all over the world thanks also to the contribution professionalism and passion that these people put into what they do every day and as such are our great heritage to protect The hope Minister is that the delegated decrees will now be issued as quickly as possible so as not to miss yet another opportunity to regulate a sector that has been waiting too long for reform
Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government when it comes to crisis and therefore the protection of cinemas we in the Lega Group believe that it is essential to analyse the phenomenon in its entirety and not just to fossilise ourselves on the need to help the operators of the sector which is certainly important and necessary but which must be included in a broader context We have therefore decided to concentrate mainly on three points which I would like to explain to this House If on the one hand we have the film and audiovisual production sector that despite the pandemic crisis and also thanks to the response of the State is experiencing a moment of particular growth on the other hand we have the cinemas and therefore the cinema distribution that live a situation of objective difficulties in which the performances of 2019 still appear far away unlike what happens instead in other countries This is also borne out by the fact that if 180 production companies applied for tax credits in 2019 493 were produced in 2021 Different things happen on the opposite front that of film distribution In fact if we compare the data of the first quarter of 2022 to those of 2019 we have negative values equal to at least 62.2 percent values that do not match absolutely those of the other countries which record data certainly less than us 34.2 percent for Germany 39.3 percent for Great Britain and 26.4 percent for Spain Even with regard to the collections we see a big difference Referring to the first four months of 2022 we note that Italy has decreased by less 7 percent while different things happen also in this case in the other countries of Europe such as France Great Britain Germany expose +47 +75 +20 and +45 percent It is therefore clear that there is a need for objective aid to film distribution operators but we must not stop here In fact the second point I would like to discuss with my colleagues in this House is the social and inclusive value of cinemas As has been said by the President of the Republic cinemas require attention and cannot be neglected precisely because of the social role they play both in large cities and in small centres as they are centres of aggregation In our country the crisis in cinemas is certainly higher than in other countries I would add that since childhood going to the cinema has always been a moment of great sociality not only for what happened before i.e. phone calls to get along but also for what could possibly happen after i.e. chats pizza and more In this sense cinemas are certainly an instrument of great sociality In short cinemas are a valuable cultural and social garrison in many territories and precisely for this reason we must do everything to preserve them and support them with effective tools that can encourage new ways of involving and encouraging viewers to go to the cinema adapted to the context and to the new habits of viewing cinematographic works Finally and this is the last point that I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate we must consider the system of windows that is the time between the first release of a film in a cinema and other forms of distribution and distribution of the same product Only France has a system of mandatory windows fixed by law and applicable to all types of films both domestic and foreign Spain and Germany have a similar system to ours which provides windows only for national state funded films while for the UK there are no windows The data as it turns out are basically similar whether there is legislation on windows or there is n't To sum up and I should like to conclude Mr President in order to raise cinemas from the crisis it is important to consider mainly the factors I have just listed firstly by giving objective support to the sector by increasing substantially the resources for this purpose and in particular by strengthening aid for small and medium sized enterprises But surely we must also review the social role of cinemas it is necessary to encourage new strategies and methods of positioning cinemas on the market in terms of socio-cultural offer We must consider not only those who run the cinemas but also the viewers With regard to this Mr President I would like to point out that an investigation is being carried out by the Department of Culture precisely to see what are the new habits of viewers In short the windows should also be removable for both foreign and Italian films with the obligation of ninety days and no more as we are asked by the managers of the cinemas
SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to thank Minister Franceschini for the commitment he is making on this day in support of the cinemas and above all because he recognizes their social value because as such they must be absolutely supported in all their aspects I also thank you for the synthesis that has been found among the various motions presented by the various parliamentary groups especially on the point concerning windows which I think are an instrument as are the contributions and economic support given to cinema operators but which are not the only thing we have to look at Just because of the social value I was talking about earlier the cinemas as some previous colleagues have said must above all be rethought We need to rethink the culture of cinema we need to rethink how to use these rooms which must not only be simple containers where people the viewers go to see a film but something more precisely because of the changed habits and modes which however are different from the past Precisely for this reason precisely because we have to put new ideas in place to rethink the rooms bring back the spectators and make them live as an experience I would like to remember an experience that has been made I take this opportunity to thank the Undersecretary Lucia Borgonzoni who helped us find a synthesis for the motions This is an idea that was put on the field in 2019 by our undersecretary Lucia Borgonzoni Moviement from 1 May to 29 August 2019 made 140 million euros cash in the cinemas of our country This is to say that with new ideas proper promotion and collaboration between the entire film system and the institutions important results can be achieved So let 's think about the cinemas and put new ideas in the field precisely to restore dignity to a place that must be of sociality first of all but that must still represent a flagship for our culture and for the film production that our country has and has always had over time
SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen the government both ancient and modern historians in speaking of the Emperor Trajan describe him as the best among the Roman emperors calling him optimus princes and this for his great gifts not only of general but also of administrator and politician qualities that allowed him to realize important territorial conquests and to accompany them with a vast program of public works of which still in Rome itself we can admire the greatness in the testimonies that are visible to all It is in this vast program of public works that was also part of the construction between 108 and 110 after Christ of the Via Traiana and the Arch of Traiano in 114 after Christ at Benevento which we go to this House today to declare a national monument These brief historical hints have absolutely no presumption of being a lesson in history but only to make people reflect on the importance they have and can assume works like the Arch of Trajan which in full merit of being declared a national monument for what it represents and not only for the architectural and artistic value it covers It is in fact evident to everyone how its grandeur its architectural structure its rich sculptural decoration make it deserve in full the definition of cultural good It is less obvious what lies behind its construction and which should be seen as a political example to be applied in our day Mr President This magnificent architectural work was in fact erected to celebrate the conclusion of the works of the already mentioned Via Traiana that for those times represented an important artery of connection between the western part of the peninsula and the ports of the east coast that facilitated the movement of goods people and traffics from and to the East It is therefore a work of great political and administrative far sightedness realized in a very short time that allowed Rome and the cities placed to the West of our peninsula not to remain excluded from the commercial traffics towards the East and to reach those parts of the territory of the present Puglia generous of salt so much so that it is then counted among the streets of salt The Arch of Traiano therefore to be seen represents a victory the fulfilment of an administrative and political decision that is the decision to build an infrastructure designed to bring benefits to the territories This is what makes the Arch of Trajan deserve the name of a national monument even more than its artistic and architectural value If for Benevento and its citizens the declaration of national monument of the Arch of Trajan will be an extra boast for their historical and cultural heritage for all must also represent and imply a political value of openness and foresight of the past applicable to our days which we must therefore make our own for the reasons just said And for this reason it must encourage us to undertake and not to hinder the realization of works and infrastructures beneficial for our country perhaps in a short time For its historical and architectural value and even more for its political value therefore the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will vote in favour of the declaration of national monument of the Arch of Trajan of Benevento
SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government the declaration of the Teatro Regio di Parma as a national monument aims to achieve a prestigious goal for Parma and its cultural historical and musical tradition And this is because the Teatro Regio is not only a neoclassical building of great artistic and architectural value built at the beginning of the nineteenth century but it is much more So let 's go see why it 's so important to Parma If we trace its history over time we see that the Teatro Regio was conceived within a program of redevelopment and valorization during the government of Maria Luigia of Habsburg Duchess of the Duchy of Parma Piacenza and Guastalla from 1816 to 1847 The Duchess wanted to make Parma a city worthy of the European capitals a very high ambition pursued by an enlightened sovereign as she was that with her good government she could give Parma a new face of which even today Parmesan and tourists can enjoy And if we think that this plan was conceived two hundred years ago with results that gave Parma the face of a city of high civilization and culture today we can do nothing but take example trying to be forward looking and with our actions and decisions as well as with the means at our disposal to realize in our territories works that enhance them and can be enjoyed by the citizens the Teatro Regio therefore as an example of good governance to which we have the duty to render honor and inspire us The Teatro Regio moreover since its inauguration in 1829 has been one of the places where important pages of the history of Parma and its territory have been written And all this must not be lost or forgotten because it is always being attached to our origins and to our history that we can value our present In it were celebrated musical events of the highest level thanks above all to that opera tradition linked to Giuseppe Verdi which precisely in Parma and in the native Busseto finds its maximum commemoration Let 's not forget that the Teatro Regio di Parma is the witness and protagonist of the crucial changes that invest the melodrama during the nineteenth and the following century from the end of the epoch linked to the name of Rossini to the supremacy of the Verdi repertoire from the opening to the French and German experiences to the Italian work of Mascagni Leoncavallo and Puccini However even in recent history there have been important moments of social life as when outside on December 26 1968 on the occasion of the inauguration of the opera season there was a tearing popular and especially youthful protest the daughter of the great protest in place in those times of change When we say Teatro Regio national monument therefore we do not just want to affirm and pay homage to the artistic and architectural importance of this beautiful building that overlooks one of the streets most frequented by Parmesan but we want to say much more Therefore we have a duty to make the most of it also as an expression of Parma 's potential in the music field Just as the Verdi Festival is an important showcase that Parma has been able to build to enhance its Verdi tradition thanks to its lyric workers in the same way the recognition as a national monument by Parliament goes in the direction of the maximum valorization of the Theatre as the glory of Parma its history and its cultural and musical tradition We can also continue by saying that the Teatro Regio national monument is also the continuation of a journey undertaken with Parma Italian capital of culture I would say a sort of icing on the cake from which it is necessary to start with events and initiatives of international scope putting at the center its main and historical theatre and its workers If it is true that among the driving engines of the economy of our country and cities like Parma there is tourism then it is very important to take hold of our cultural heritage in all its forms valorizing all aspects to make truly alive and driving that tourism that otherwise without culture would remain an empty box The Teatro Regio is part of this heritage both as it is visible from an artistic and architectural point of view as well as from what it represents Having listed some of the symbolic aspects that it brings with it I would like to conclude with some reference to its artistic and architectural characteristics not because it is of secondary importance but because I think it is always necessary to go beyond the tangible beauty to grasp much more The construction began in 1821 on a project by the court architect Nicola Bettoli and the Theatre was inaugurated on May 16 1829 with Zaira by Vincenzo Bellini The Theatre is in neoclassical style the façade is characterized by an Ionic colonnade and a large terminal window that opens in the upper part After passing the atrium you enter the room of the foyer marked by two rows of four columns a staircase leads to the hall of the reduced where was the throne of Maria Luigia Through the portal of honour you enter the heart of the building the hall with the audience four orders of stages and the loggione dominated by the ceiling painted by Giovan Battista Borghesi The curtain one of the few to come to us is also the work of the Borghesi The appearance of the hall today is very different from the original Girolamo Magnani who was among other things a decorator that Verdi often wanted at his side as a set designer was commissioned by Carlo III of Bourbon to renew the robe of the Teatro Regio according to the neo-Renaissance style The acoustic chamber painted by Giuseppe Carmignani one of the rare examples that survived the use and the time resumes the decorations of the stages and consists of hemp panels mounted on wooden frames telescopically modular to serve the most diverse orchestral formations Originally this is a curiosity the Theatre was intended to host performances of various kinds from funambolism to gymnastics numbers with trained animals scientific demonstrations illusionism and also various curiosities Of great value is the clock which marks the time of works and concerts that have followed on the stage of the Theatre since 1829 In 2018 after a year of restoration the historic watch of the Teatro Regio created by Antonio Barozzi came back to work This brief description makes evident the artistic and architectural value of the Teatro Regio di Parma but as I have said several times in this speech his declaration as a national monument wants to be not only the exaltation of a beautiful neoclassical architecture but also and above all the valorization of what it represents for Parma and what it can represent Parma in Europe and in the world if we can value it as it deserves It should be remembered that together with the birthplace of Giuseppe Verdi already declared a national monument and the Teatro Magnani di Fidenza and the Teatro Giuseppe Verdi di Busseto it can aim to become an international unicum I would like to end by thanking my colleagues from the Culture Committee the President Senator Riccardo Nencini and the Senator and rapporteur Albert Laniece who have joined me in this bill and of course the Government today represented by the Undersecretary Lucia Borgonzoni I thank my colleagues who have spoken and shared with me this statement of the Teatro Regio as a national monument I am very pleased that the Assembly will vote in favour of this bill and as Parmesan I invite everyone to visit and above all to live the Teatro Regio di Parma an excellent symbol of parmesanity
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President in announcing the vote in favour of the Lega Salvini Premier Sardo d'Action Party to the measure we take the opportunity to thank all the Presidency Council the Secretary the Deputy Secretaries all the officials the Commissions the offices and the assistants for all the work they have done and the support they have given us I would of course like to express my special thanks to the Government which has given us the opportunity to meet here all together during the last week of the election campaign because it has not only given a favourable opinion to an amendment which provided for the transfer of the ceiling to salaries for certain categories and to the Forces of Order but it has even reworded it by extending the audience of the beneficiaries except then indignantly to blame Parliament to demand that the House be changed with an amendment of its own and then passed it to the Senate for the third reading Really a masterpiece Thank you
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President I am speaking on the same subject as my previous colleague because today on 15 February the rule of vaccination for those over 50 years of age has come into force and therefore the duty to present the so called enhanced green pass to go to work Without going into the merits of the measure itself I know that in Parliament as in the country as in the Government there are different sensibilities and I respect them all However we would like to stress something that should concern both you Mr President and the Presidency Council as well as the Government itself At an acute stage of the pandemic whether it pleases or not certain restrictive measures of personal freedom which even touch a constitutional right such as that at work can find their justification At a stage such as the current one which according to experts is now endemic and no longer acute certain measures have no real reason to be We therefore wish the government well but not only that since then Parliament is us I am addressing all my colleagues in all the parties let us reason and try to understand well what is happening in the light of the economic situation the energy crisis rising inflation prices including food prices are now skyrocketing and those who go to the market and shop know what I am talking about and the entrepreneurial fabric that is likely to close Can we afford to leave a million unpaid workers at home This is a reflection we make to the Assembly and to the Government We are the people 's representatives because if the rules apply to citizens they also apply to Members of Parliament That must be clear A popular saying says that hunger infuses courage and we must be careful not to create a spiral of social tensions that can be very very harmful not only for the economy of our country but also for the social estate
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President the League will vote for the government and if it had not been placed it would still have voted for the measure in our examination because our position is clear according to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter Ukraine has the right duty to defend itself The Italian Government has a duty to lend all the necessary help to the Ukrainian people including military aid also respecting and this is something we must remember the Atlantic Pact Therefore it is right to respect international agreements because a common European defence is necessary not only for greater European integration but also and above all as a deterrent effect for those that can be present or future attacks This is crucial The League at the same time unlike others has asked to moderate its tones Why The world is currently walking on a thin red line that can plunge us into an escalation of conflict and lead us to World War III Therefore we must give the words that are spoken and be very careful about the actions that we want to take this is why we said to moderate the tones It made us smile a bit 'a certain warlike fury perhaps from some characters also from the press someone defines them as the warriors living room the warriors sofa in short those who perfectly follow the Italian tradition synthesized in the phrase Armiamomi e parti Let us return to our natural beehive which is that of diplomacy this is the word we used We want to see an Italy that is at the forefront on the diplomatic front and we are pleased that President Draghi and the Government have taken this initiative Premier Draghi's phone call with both Zelensky and Putin was absolutely important The premier said we want to talk about peace The aim is the negotiation that must yes lead us to an agreement which will then have international guarantees but that is the way forward Therefore the government does what is right and that is contained in this decree- law but on the other hand push its action as it is doing also and above all on the diplomatic front It is right to help refugees and here too the decree contains important measures for the most part they are women and children fleeing from bombs let it be clear and therefore it is right to help them Indeed in this regard as a League but together with all the forces of majority we have asked and obtained there is a precise commitment of the Government that on unaccompanied minors in order to meet the needs of the mayors the State takes full responsibility for the expenses precisely to help the smaller municipalities Moreover we ask the Government it is a commitment that will mainly concern the next decrees starting from the so called price cut decree that there be the will to help also our families and our enterprises That 's the point Among the headlines of some of today 's newspapers is Small and medium sized companies with gas barrels and we talk about expensive energy and expensive fuel we cannot think and we say this to the Government with all due respect that the fuel discount can last thirty days It must be extended It must be extended We cannot think that we can't help some businesses that are closing down because they can't stand up anymore Last time we talked about the middle class many families in crisis Yesterday there was a statement that many people can't even pay their bills anymore because they do n't have the money and they do n't pay them We must make an intervention but the government objects that the Ministry of Economics and Finance of money are not there because everything that could be collected was collected for the decree energy in the House and for the price cut in the Senate Well we understand this We must then intervene with the European Union to allow the Member States of Europe to make the budgetary deviation because we cannot but give resources to our economy unless we want to shut down businesses and put the vast majority of our people into poverty I do not think that is the objective of the European Union So all the more so we must insist on the willingness to find these resources As we said everything that has been done is right The measures that the government has put in place to support our families are also good but knowing that they are not enough more needs to be done It is the commitment that we are asking the Government and with this we reaffirm our vote in favour of the confidence and the measure under consideration
Mr President more than a comment on these two decree laws because they are two merged into one which were thought a while ago it was December 28th and there was a very different epidemiological situation it was the peak of infection death and hospitalization I am about to express a kind of hope towards the members of the Government who are present here First of all since the epidemiological picture has changed there has been a collapse fortunately dizzying of cases so hospitals are starting to breathe and intensive therapies have decreased it is good that the government begins to change strategy Probably at a certain stage the most acute of the pandemic the green pass and the super green pass were used to vaccinate citizens So we say once and for all it is a surreptitious obligation More obligation this than the obligation imposed by law At least we 're clear we 're telling each other and we 're avoiding hypocrisies Now that 90 of citizens over 12 are vaccinated I say this to the Undersecretary those who are vaccinated are vaccinated while those who are not vaccinated will hardly be vaccinated with the obligations they have entered As we can see from the number of first daily doses these are no longer the obligations that can convince the rest Perhaps it is better to convince the so called hesitant avoid the iron fist that perhaps compacts them among themselves and above all scares them but seek dialogue and confrontation We will never tire of saying it dialogue and confrontation If the data continues to improve as we all hope if the virus becomes endemic and you go towards the end of the state of emergency you have to start thinking of loosening the restrictions you also have to start thinking of storing the green pass starting with the super green pass Why do I say that Let us look at what is happening in other countries in Europe and outside In Great Britain from 21 February Covid 19 will be declared a flu like disease in Denmark stop to masks and green passes the Covid 19 is no longer a socially critical disease in France they will recall the super green pass So is it plausible that in a week instead in Italy we force people to vaccinate otherwise we stop them from going to work Is it plausible to think that a representative of the people cannot enter Parliament if he is not vaccinated Let 's think about it Let 's talk about this The citizens must all be the same Therefore we also give the non-Vaccinated to work and the non-Vaccinated to come to Parliament to carry out their duties which have been assigned to them by the Constitution We hope that the Government will intervene in this direction also because compared to the abolition of the green pass there are also many trivaccinate who are tired of having to present every time the pass in order to carry out their work and all the activities that everyday life requires In addition over time the risk is also that our economy will be damaged rather than in some way favored We are thinking above all of the tourism sector So the sooner we get back to normal the sooner we get rid of the pass the sooner we get our economy back on track Above all let 's look at the numbers carefully Here again I address the Undersecretary looking at the real numbers and drawing the right conclusions because you cannot continue to consider dead for Covid 19 those who did not die because of the Covid 19 but who died from other evils and had also done a positive buffer as the World Health Organization had suggested Not to mention some hospital that rigs the data as the Restart survey on Rai 2 explained clearly basically to have more resources and more money We know in fact that the patients of Covid 19 are being renovated both economically and at the hospital level in a greater way than in many other situations Mr. Undersecretary and members of the government the picture is now heading towards the end of the pandemic We all hope so and hope so but the impression is that if we listened to the CTS the emergency would last fifteen years It is understandable why if there is no longer an emergency the role of the CTS also diminishes and therefore those who are part of it would probably no longer be directly involved in the first person as it is now It is humanly understandable but beware such a thing would feed a culture of suspicion until yesterday unjustified Some would be entitled to think that people want to get used to surveillance and we hope that that is not the goal Politics is once again the protagonist taking back the space that has been left to doctors at this stage Politics must once again be a protagonist using common sense and reasonableness I say it out of the teeth we consider it a great exaggeration to remove salaries and pensions social life and even deny treatment to those who have not been vaccinated We have always treated rightly I add murderers and illegals because they are people and I remember these words sculpted If an Italian citizen decides not to vaccinate what do we do Are n't we gonna cure him and let him starve to death Excuse me but as Christians perhaps we should all ask ourselves a few questions If this is the so called new humanism then we should call it inhumanity Excuse me but it should be Bassetti talks about pacification Crisanti says that today chasing those who do not want to vaccinate does not serve and would not change anything Francesco Vaia director of Spallanzani said to free cities from fear restoring the joy of living The obsession with Covid is generating insecurity and aggression We are careful because people want to return to normal and we cannot talk about normalities by associating it with free tablets
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President first of all I would like to point out that it would be more appropriate when discussing a decree law to talk about it directly and not perhaps in general about the importance of vaccinations or the green pass as did those who intervened before me retracing the whole history of the pandemic Let us rest rather on the decree under consideration which was issued in the first days of January which we will of course vote on because trust has been placed and we will vote on it for a sense of responsibility as we have always done because we have always responded to responsibility by people and by the responsible political group It is certain however that if there had been no confidence and we had to vote on the measure we would probably have abstained As already in the Chamber of Deputies in fact we have highlighted some criticalities of this decree- law starting from the fact that perhaps the obligation of vaccination for the over 50 and for those at risk would have been better to predict it a little before January 7 Among other things this measure today becomes somewhat anachronistic because two months ago it could have its justifications on the basis of the very alarming data in terms of both death occupation of intensive therapies and hospitalizations while today we are fortunately in a completely different situation There is however another element that justifies our perplexities because these are critical issues that have also highlighted our ministers within the Government namely the issue of DAD for non-vaccined children This decree provides that children between five and eleven years of age who are not vaccinated will end up in DAD compared to those who are vaccinated This is discrimination indeed let us be clear it is a masked obligation that we have not shared first of all because we are talking about children Among other things someone I say this to Undersecretary Sileri must explain to us why there is all this insistence on children from five to eleven years old only in Italy when caution is preached throughout Europe or at least vaccination is advised to children if they are fragile if they have certain diseases or if immunodepressed We would like to understand why this happens only in Italy also because then there is a recent study conducted in eleven states of the United States that shows that children between the five and the eleven years are hospitalized more for the influence than for the Covid because then you have to go to check all the data well We understand the obligation for the over 50 and for a population group that was undoubtedly particularly at risk but this insistence on children someone has to explain it to us There is also another subject that has been introduced in this decree with an amendment the difference in treatment between Italians and foreigners If a foreigner arrives in Italy and has had two doses of vaccine for more than six months just the swab and can easily enter the hotel or go to the restaurant The Italian citizen cannot do this because if he has taken two doses or had a cure and it has been six months the super green pass expires It is right to help tourism we would be missing something else we have the Minister for Tourism and we are the first to be satisfied from this point of view but we cannot discriminate between a European citizen and an Italian citizen The point as I said is not so much this decree law itself but it is what will happen at the end of the state of emergency Gentlemen Undersecretaries Minister Hope if the emergency ends what will happen from April 1st This chronoprogram for which you gradually get to the date of June 15 does not stand if the emergency ends on March 31 the legal basis of the green pass fails This is what we need to highlight Otherwise the green pass becomes a political tool and no longer a health instrument If we are not in emergency why keep the super green pass green pass and more In fact it is the same virologists who advise given that the situation at the moment has improved considerably and it is assumed that at the end of March it will be even better to give freedom to the citizens since we do not know what could happen in October We hope that everything will be fine and that the pandemic will be over but we can possibly think of restrictions if things do not go well in the autumn This is the period in which to guarantee freedom and serenity to the whole population Now is the time to do so and not arrive until June What does it mean to remove the super green pass for outdoor restaurants It 's a joke Do things right also because already now with the state of emergency of the sentences of the TAR of Lazio have suspended the provision of non-wage to those who do not want to vaccinate because the judges consider necessary a balance between the constitutional principle of health protection and the right to sustenance At this stage with the arrival of the war with all the economic difficulties and the increase of the bills we can think of it as we want but if one does not want to vaccinate it is unreasonable to take away his salary and not let him work I repeat it is unreasonable Mr. Undersecretary everyone here thinks the same way almost everyone Do not abuse the patience of citizens and Parliament because there is a unity of consensus Since 1 April there will be some measures in this House and there will be some votes in this House So tell that to Minister Hope among other things founder of the party called Article One Article 1 of the Constitution states that Italy is a democratic Republic founded on labour But he 's the first to take the job off Remember him with elegance and politeness because we know his character So there would be more use all the precautions but remind him since he is still the secretary of that party I have spoken about compensations about the fact that this is the right time about not abusing the patience of the Italians and of Parliament but above all I wanted to say this is the issue that at a particular moment of difficulty of acute phase of the pandemic there is a need for restrictive measures But if things go better and everyone rightly thinks that we must fight to defend democracy and freedom let us begin to defend the freedom of our fellow countrymen I conclude by saying also to the Ministry itself that the Covid 19 is there Nobody denies that Prudence and caution but we cannot as a country be obsessed with Covid 19 What 's the result The alarm cry of Italian oncology associations with screenings that were almost all blocked I quote data There is a risk that in the coming years from now to 2040 there will be a 32 increase in cancers precisely because screening is not done for a whole range of reasons because we need to swab and because hospitals are occupied by something else We work on this as we work on the Law Lorenzin I have asked several questions and have them also presented to the Parent Company in 12a Commission Senator Fregolent The law passed by Parliament on 22 December 2017 provided for significant benefits for research into paediatric cancers Until now Mr Undersecretaries and Mr Ministers the implementing decrees have not yet been enacted How is that possible Just the battle just all the effort I thank the Ministry for everything that has been done in the fight against Covid 19 and for everything that you continue to do Colleagues however does not exist only the Covid 19 You die from many other pathologies and there are many children who would need those implementing decrees
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group condemns Russia 's ongoing military aggression against Ukraine We fully support President Draghi for a joint response from the Allies We need a strong compact united West Our hope of course is that hostilities will cease immediately and that we will return to the line of diplomacy and dialogue which is the main way to resolve conflicts I quote in this regard a statement made by former US Secretary of State Richard Nixon on 5 March 2014 that Ukraine must represent a bridge between the West and Russia and not an outpost of one against the other and vice versa Let 's start from this point of view I agree that there should be no ambiguity no distinction but also no speculation I think in fact that it is wise I say this to point out that Italian diplomacy which has always played an important role and a long tradition in relations with Moscow can be useful at this time of difficulty
Mr President Mr President in Office of the Council distinguished Ministers and Undersecretaries ladies and gentlemen there is no doubt that democracy and freedom are at stake in this conflict as the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni has reminded us very well However we must also be careful to ensure that this freedom which is put in danger from the outside is also defended inside because unfortunately too often it happens that it is enough to deviate from a minimum very little from the dominant thought from the mainstream and politically correct to be immediately accused of complicity with the enemy ambiguity and being bearers of hatred and anything else As if it were forbidden to advance a but to pose a doubt to try to reason to seek the so called right means that has made over the centuries a bit the history of our country of our culture Why do I say that Because we have seen it in recent years it happens a little across the West Mr President when it comes to certain issues from gender policies to immigration to Covid and also on the subject of war woe to deviate from what is the dominant thought It is enough to say and to say that we must dialogue with Russia not in order to make its interest but in a functional way to open negotiations which must obviously be between two parties and must also include Russia in order to be immediately accused of pointillism rather than anti-Europeanism and so on Now thankfully since both Macron and Scholz have said that we need to talk to Putin at least we have knocked down this politically correct wall and we understand we know this that it is not so much what is said in the substance but who says it and especially how it says it I quote another example namely a statement by the Secretary of the Democratic Party Enrico Letta who a few days ago let go of a thought that I personally absolutely share better an imperfect peace than war It is almost had to run to the shelter not to deny but at least to correct that it was just a quote and that there is no change of line This kind of attitude says a lot about what are the real possibilities of being free to express in a Parliament and in the country what are legitimate opinions You can be absolutely convinced of Europeans Atlanticists and consider the most powerful weapon of diplomacy Since I mentioned the speech of the most powerful weapon there is no doubt that if we had not provided military aid and support to Ukraine especially in the first part of the conflict it would have been difficult to bring Russia to the negotiating table because it would have won the war in two weeks and probably decided to invade some other country as well So it is absolutely true and important what has been done and it has been voted in a resolution It is also true that in view of the fact that this is a conflict of some depth which risks I say this by quoting a journalist uncontrollable waves it would be just as good for this military support to continue in the context of the legitimate defence of the Ukrainian people just as we voted in the resolution of 1 March being careful that self defense does not in turn become aggression That 's what we 're asking for Are we saying something scandalous No in our opinion we are simply saying what most people call common sense what we are talking about when we also want to discuss these issues without necessarily being geopolitical experts In the same way it is equally true this certainly that we must not divide the West It is clear that the West must not be divided especially at the level of public opinion we would play the game of the enemy Putin I repeat there is no doubt about this Of course it is all true however in order to avoid playing the game of our enemy there remain essentially two open paths to follow which you Mr Draghi together with the other Heads of State will have to discuss in the European Council The first is that the international community the European Union NATO all possible states that can stand in the way of trying to resolve the conflict separate aggressor and attacker and both commit themselves to a negotiated peace immediate with a ceasefire This is the path we prefer and which we expect but if it is not possible and should instead continue according to NATO alarms an extension of the war because someone claims that Putin will lose and that Ukraine 's victory will certainly not go through a ceasefire if the war really lasts for a long time then the European Union and all the institutions should start to think that we must intervene very seriously to support our economic fabric made by small and medium sized entrepreneurs All this to protect the purchasing power of workers and pensioners given the increase in inflation to compensate for the imbalances resulting from the sanctions applied to Russia which certainly hurt Russia as the President in Office of the Council says but also to us let us not forget that We must face the food crisis something that the President of the Council himself has highlighted At this moment then there are emergencies on which we must intervene quickly we must declare the state of calamity for the obvious drought that is hitting our country and not only We need to act quickly to ensure an energy independence as soon as possible not dependent on others 750 wells are still and must be reactivated immediately regardless of the parties of the no which unfortunately in this country have caused the ruin on many sectors and on many fronts We need to stop migratory flows and on this point it is only the Government you chaired Mr President in Office of the Council that shines particularly there is a 30 increase even in the light of the risks associated with the food crisis Speculation must be stopped and in this respect the idea that you have launched on the price cap then on the roof at the price of gas but not only on that All this however must be done quickly because we cannot allow workers to begin to lose their jobs that our manufacturing industry begins to close its doors that our economy faces degradation and a complete débâcle because in the face of a social and economic degradation there would be disturbances that would lead public opinion not only of Italy but of the whole of Europe and of the whole of the West to divide and in that case we would play the game of our enemy Putin Europe therefore knows that if war lasts for a long time because this is the road that must inevitably be taken if there are no other solutions it must intervene and when one is in a war economy as President Macron has explicitly stated there are two roads or taxes are being increased but we do not want to go this way and the President of the Council said that it would never increase them or public debt is being increased but Europe does not seem to have understood much seeing the latest recommendations from the European Commission We must move in this direction We understand that in the end the decisions are taken by you Heads of State and Government with the relevant Ministers in the European Council then there will be the G7 Summit in Bavaria and the NATO Summit in Madrid It is you who make the decisions indeed often let me say this I do not only do it on a controversial issue it does not seem that Parliament gives the direction to the Government but in some cases it seems that the Government gives the direction to Parliament and unfortunately this happens not only in Italy but also in other European countries Since you decide this time we tell you to hurry I do not know if he remembers it hurry because there is not only the risk that peace is seriously drifting away but also that soon the air conditioners will not work either
"Mr President in thanking all my colleagues I would point out that it is certainly not my intention to waste this House 's time I should have spoken in the general debate yesterday but the commitments of these days have not allowed me to do so So I try quickly to recover during the discussion on trust This is a decree that goes towards normality and which has the title Superation of measures against the pandemic following the cessation of the state of emergency it is in itself good news and we are absolutely happy about it as we are also voting on a decree that goes in that direction The point of my speech is that we hope not to be accused of mischievous majesty if we allow ourselves to say that an opportunity has been missed This could have been the right opportunity in the light of the cessation of the state of emergency to make a picture of clear and precise measures of precise provisions to be maintained on the subject of the pandemic Unfortunately there has been some chaos in certain cases For example on the question of masks there is some uncertainty we can say about the use yes to the mask if the place of work is public while it is recommended if the place is private as if there were a difference and as if the virus hit on one side rather than the other yes to the mask in the business canteens and public work no to the masks in the restaurants yes to the mask in a sports structure indoors like the Palaeur or the Forum of Assago even if there is a gap no to the mask in a stadium with 70,000 people all crushed assembled without any distance I mean these are measures that leave at least some debate It is said no to the mask for children up to six years old but for six years up yes to the mask on flights with Italian license we should put the mask while on other European flights no here too some question should be asked In class I 'm talking about schools the mask is maintained but then the same children go out go to the sports center to the bar play together hug as is right they make all their games and the mask is not expected In short the logic of such choices honestly is a little 'all to understand In some cases we can say that there are also situations at the limit of ridicule such as for example what will happen on aircraft also in the light of the choices made by the European Safety Agency I 'd say it 's gonna be pretty peculiar Minister Hope told us that however science decides they are not political choices but science decides But when a group of parents and associations sent a formal request to the Ministry to see if there is a study that highlights risks and benefits on the issue of masks imposed from the six years up there has even arrived a written response from the Director General of the Prevention of the Ministry of Health who said that the Ministry does not have any study Then the question is are certain technical choices as the Minister calls them daughters of science or propaganda sold as science In this chaos about using the mask in uncertainty what does a person do It often happens to me too when I enter a place I wonder whether or not I have to wear it like at the supermarket or at the airport In uncertainty I put the mask rightly also to avoid running into some violation of the rules or even simply because I fear that people may look at me badly That 's what kind of happens So the question is is this chaos the result of negligence operational difficulties Covid bureaucracy as someone calls it or is it a precise strategy to get used to the gag These are the answers that must be given We have always supported the choices made by the government and thank him for all the work he has done It is not easy to deal with such situations but it is also true that it is equally necessary for the minister responsible to give answers to the many questions that our Group has tabled in recent months to ask for explanations light on the so called scientific evidence explaining also why we are asking on this occasion since the Secretary is also present the whole European Union has downgraded the virus as an influence while we continue to wear masks We just need to know why Explain it to us I am not saying that the European Union is right and that we are wrong and that we are wrong We just want answers Perhaps and we also say this in the light of what will happen in the autumn it would be good to try to focus attention as many experts have already pointed out in numerous newspapers elderly and fragile Those who must be protected not only now but also after are the elderly and the fragile Nevertheless many times both in the Chamber and in the Commissions in dealing with the issue of fragile people we have not had all the attention to promote smart working and meet certain needs in order to protect precisely the fragility which I think is the primary objective that the Government should pursue even from a future perspective We are happy and happy to convert a decree for overcoming the measures against the pandemic even if we need a lot of caution and we must be careful because the pandemic has not been defeated at all There are some answers that have remained unanswered and we also want to understand why Italy maintains a road not exactly similar to that of other European countries since here we are always talking about the European Union and we are said to be united and working together From this point of view it would perhaps be appropriate to adopt at least common strategies to combat the pandemic adapting a little to the choices that are made elsewhere That is our wish It is true that we are faced with yet another vote of confidence but we also understand that the processing times of the decrees are unfortunately very long We would have preferred not to be trusted but we understand that such choices are important and this fundamental decree Therefore as announced in the explanation of vote our vote will be very much in favour However we wanted to highlight a number of observations Let 's hope we 're not accused of mischievous majesty That is our final wish"
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President I am always speaking on the subject of the famous amendments tabled in Article 2 It is quite unusual for amendments to be tabled which have not actually been tabled in this House PRESIDENT The debate is These are explanations of vote on Article 2 Senator Romeo You can talk about what you want of course it 's not unusual ROMEO L SP PSd Az Then I also make an explanation of vote on Article 2 What I cannot understand however in the light of what my colleague has just said namely the opposition to Bolkestein the fact that their amendments have not been taken into account the fact that they are against all the work that has been done and against the expropriation is because no deleterious amendment has been tabled for this House if you really were so against it Excuse me colleagues but I need to understand this otherwise the suspicion comes that politically you go out and tell a story and then in essence you approve the agreement that the government made Once and for all we must be clear before the Italian citizens
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President I would ask you to speak because from what they have explained to me at the regulatory level the amendments that are rejected in the Commission can be tabled again in this House there are some for example tabled by Senator Angrisani and other senators who have been rejected in the Commission and who have been retabled in this House Not only that but our Rules of Procedure also provide that new amendments may be tabled provided that they intervene in the parts modified by the Commission Now I have to say that foreclosed or not foreclosed an amendment if I thought as you say I would have tabled it on a modified part on the company value or on everything else Do not come and teach us what the Rules of Procedure provide Let 's just say I 'm hearing the crunch of the nails sliding down the mirror
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President by announcing the vote in favour of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group on the measure under consideration we would like to highlight two important aspects because the draft competition law does not only concern what the newspapers have highlighted in the last period namely the theme of bathing but many others such as transport health hydropower in short many important and strategic sectors for our territories as well as the story of bathing made known by the media We are talking about a point that we consider to be fundamental and on which the League had already demonstrated itself in this House with Law No 135 of 2018 which finally gave the opportunity to move towards the renewal of the expired concessions of the major hydroelectric derivations giving a very important signal to the territories In the measure under discussion there is confirmation that these renewal procedures will be carried out with great support to the territories especially the mountainous ones moreover it has also been thought of the hydroelectric which especially in the light of the fact that there is so much talk of renewable sources is perhaps the cleanest energy source that there is and does not need to have large invades Moreover it is an energy that can be programmed over time and is not like wind which depends on the presence of wind or like photovoltaics which depends on the presence of the sun it is constant and can be programmed and this is fundamental We are not just talking about the issues that generate controversy we must also emphasize important results that go to the territory more appropriate canons environmental compensation and all things that benefit our territories which is what the League has always said and for which it has always fought This is an issue that we wanted to highlight In order not to go too far I would like to turn to the other subject which has been the subject of controversy namely that of the beaches Some argue that there is no coherence in the action that the Government and that some political forces have taken forward We as League put consistency on this issue when we did Law No. 145 of 2018 with the then Minister Gian Marco Centinario I was a signatory to an amendment along with my colleague Mr Ripamonti which gave ample time to arrive at public evidence we had set a deadline for 2033 with a whole series of paths to be made such as mapping and checking whether the resource was scarce or not There were a whole series of principles which had borne the impact of the European Commission 's observations then Minister Centinario had done this What happens next Time passes and let us not forget this and let us not hide it comes a decision of the Council of State which deletes this law That is the question we have to ask ourselves why do the magistrates come to say that a law is good or not good They should just apply it not interpret it Instead this interpretation came with a very close deadline 2023 Therefore it is not the fault of the League if the decision of the Council of State that establishes that by the end of 2023 there must be new assignments and public evidence must be made In the light of this judgment the Government had to take note of this and put forward proposals In hearing the associations there were three main issues on which it was necessary to fight the associations and the bathing establishments asked three things noted that one could not help but apply this decision of the Council of State Of course then there is a whole new case law because now there is the TAR of Lecce that has returned to the European Court but these are all issues that we will then consider always ready to intervene in the light of new judgments and new aspects at the judicial level We took note of the fact that at the moment it was important to intervene to protect companies because if we had not done anything there was only the decision of the Council of State and no one would have protected anyone I said there were three principles The first principle is rewards to protect micro small and medium sized enterprises especially in order to protect those who have a dominant source of income resulting from the fact that they have this concession Then there was the question of the transitional period because we remind everyone that the races are made by the municipalities which must be put in a position to intervene also at the organizational level However we have seen with the PNRR that there are difficulties money often comes but we do not have the people who do the projects because Europe 's austerity policies have not given the opportunity to replace people especially employees officials and experts Let 's say all this is austerity these are the results of austerity At some point the municipalities may need a little more time in fact this period is guaranteed within the norm The third question concerns the famous fair compensation those who take over must of course pay compensation to those who leave the concession because there are the business and the value of the company This compensation must also protect the tradition of our territory and everything else As a proxy law we had to incorporate these three principles Go and see in the provision at least we tell everyone inside these three principles are sanctioned by law and by way of derogation from the code of navigation there is also the possibility of resorting to project financing as provided by the code of contracts That too must be said and emphasized As far as the transitional period is concerned we will then check because it is also dictated by the disputes that exist so we will see what happens Secondly clear rewards because at the end of the day when small and family businesses are protected 70 of the companies present in our territory are given the opportunity to protect them This is a sacrosanct principle written black on white in the law Then we will go to the bathing establishments with the text of the law to show what is written because too many fakes turn on the chats which tell what you want to tell You have to look and read to see what it says Then there is the issue of compensation Certainly the associations are not happy because they would have preferred the compensation rule to be written in full However we reiterate that this is a delegated law which as such can sanction the principle How do we do in the law it was here the difficulty to contemplate all the existing cases in our country It would have been impossible and in two months we 'd still be there I thank Vice Minister Pichetto Fratin colleagues from Forza Italia Senators Gasparri and Mallegni Senator Marti who is near here and the rapporteurs Ripamonti and Collina because there has also been a common commitment and work from other parts How do we define all these cases so that we do not stay here for three months and risk lengthening time and putting the draft competition law at risk since clearly that is not our objective We decided to establish the principle and then move on to the legislative decree I shall conclude Mr President Of course the Ministers concerned by this measure are many and it is not just one they will do well to open a table with the associations write compensation properly and resolve this situation once and for all No more European infringements but certainty investment possibilities and finally protection for these companies which have lived in uncertainty for too many years This was our commitment and the real goal and we are not afraid to go around telling it For these reasons the vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will be firmly in favour
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President President in Office of the Council members of the Government ladies and gentlemen in the context of just and proper support for the Ukrainian people from a humanitarian and economic point of view as well as for military aid which you and your Government are pursuing we are allowing ourselves to give you a suggestion Mr Draghi We ask you to use a little more calm in some circumstances because on some occasions they were too belligerent or at least they were perceived as such the population gets scared and we think that public opinion should be reassured On the other hand at a stage like this public opinion is absolutely important At the same time I recall that Italy is a country with a very long tradition of diplomacy of the highest level which must be taken into account The same determination and determination as you and the action of the whole Government we call for action to convince the European Union that aid is also needed for the internal economies of the Member States of the European Union We need help from our families as well as from our businesses President Draghi on the internal front the economic repercussions of this war will mainly affect the ordinary people what has remained let us say of the middle class small and medium sized enterprises artisans traders professionals micro-entrepreneurs farmers that economic fabric that has made Italy great in history and that today after two years of pandemic it is already quite martyred There are many entrepreneurs who can't stand it anymore there are many who are closing and can't keep it open This is serious damage We call on the Government and you Mr President to ask the European Union not only to intervene to protect strategic industrial areas but also this middle class which for us Italians is and has always been strategic We must not forget also the many companies that will suffer losses due to the application of sanctions against Russia Just to give examples the Lombardy Russian interchange is worth about 3 billion Confcommercio Lombardy has told us of which 1.5 billion only for the city of Milan We cannot forget that there are also 447 Italian companies operating in Russia with a turnover of about 7.4 billion which today feel abandoned to themselves You Mr Draghi who determines European choices despite perhaps your low profile wants us to believe otherwise let the partners of the European Union understand that we cannot return to the Europe of accountants and numerals We absolutely need an expansionary policy and extra spending space because we have to help our internal economies In a policy let 's say so also of control in order to try to avoid the speculative bubbles that have hit not only the fuel let us remind you for example the fact that lately the large shipping companies ten in the world of which four Europeans and one Swiss have suddenly made all cartels and have increased the transport costs of twelve times not justifying not even an increase of the fuel itself Is there a European Commission body responsible for antitrust Yes so why does n't he intervene We need immediate action otherwise with these transport costs we risk really putting much or much of our entrepreneurial fabric on our knees We therefore count on his intervention because what we must avoid after two years of pandemic and now the arrival of war is that Italy increasingly weakened in its productive system becomes the victim of predatory activity of foreign countries and capitals We cannot afford to become a sort of European discount Let 's close quickly with the theme of green transition which must be built Of course we agree it must be built yes but gradually because one cannot think of doing so with that ideological supposition of those who have aimed to put out the fossil energies coal oil and gas without having first ensured an alternative energy self sufficiency It was a short sighted European Union policy of which we are unfortunately paying the price today Similarly we pay the price on other issues such as the fact that the issue of agriculture which is now central with the emergency that you have highlighted has always been put by the European Union as opposed to the environment no it is a strategic mistake which unfortunately has contributed over the years and now to putting ourselves in the political conditions as we said before of emergency We probably would have been more prepared if there had n't been this shortsightedness For these reasons in telling you these things and giving you as we said at the beginning some suggestions we announce the League 's vote in favour of majority resolution built with the right balance
Mr President I have anticipated the intervention in such a way as to try to be clear because the aim of the intervention of the League is above all to make clarity Meanwhile we start from the reason that led President Draghi to resign after the Movimento 5 Stars de facto decided not to vote for the trust on an important measure such as the decree law aid of 14 July last It is clear that it is easy to give responsibility only to the 5 Stars who from a political point of view have highlighted the lack of a vote of confidence however if we want to be serious we cannot think that the PD had nothing to do with all this since the thermovaluer was wanted by Mayor Gualtieri and that the Democratic Party was not able to eliminate the wide field that it wanted to create Moreover if we want to say it all since they then try to accuse us of the center right surely the split of the minister Di Maio has favored the fact that Conte could distance himself from the government therefore even those who managed the direction of that operation has a political responsibility relative to the situation in which our country is located at this moment I have heard so much talk about responsibility but we also highlight the political irresponsibility of certain majority members of the Government of National Unity The other important point to clarify because it is right that Italians know President Draghi is to understand if the goal is to save the country she is very authoritative and has all the esteem of the League Group or if the primary interest becomes to save the wide progressive field that as we have seen ended up with some error I use a joke made by Mr Mastella he ended up in the incinerator in Rome We have to understand what the truth is because if the objective is to support the broad progressive field in the end this means showing up in this Chamber essentially pretending that nothing has happened with the same team of Ministers except for a few minor adjustments and a blank delegation take or leave We in this case would have some problems some concerns also because after all that has happened it would not be serious towards the Italians and not even our voters because unlike many others we have to account to our voters to our base and to our citizens If the goal is to save the country and I am convinced as we have known it in this time we see a couple of scenarios on the horizon The first would be to note that the 5 Star Movement is no longer part of the majority of the Government of National Unity also because there is some kind of basic incompatibility In your speech Mr President in Office you spoke about the issue of gas the difficulties we will encounter this autumn the budgetary manoeuvre Thinking about the issue of energy and gas can we face an emergency of this nature and this level with who on the other side says no to the increase in gas production stop at drills no to regasifiers It is impossible to make the country 's interest with these traveling companions So I have found that the Movimento 5 Stars is outside at this point we take note instead as my colleague Anna Maria Bernini said in the debate on the last vote of confidence the one that the 5 Stars did not vote that a new majority was born that of 14 July Taking his words as a starting point President we need to rebuild a new pact Of course Mr President we are there but it means a new majority and we need to rebuild a new government that is what we mean with goals even new even a little more ambitious since there are no more 5 Stars Mr President you have rightly pointed out that the income of citizenship must be improved We use a word a little more incisive that goes in the interests of the Italians it must be thoroughly revised which does not mean not helping the needy or those who will have difficulty in accessing the world of work of this we are absolutely aware someone in the old governments had called it income of inclusion is fine but if you realize that a measure designed to stimulate the job in reality discourages it in many cases we must also have the courage to say that we want to change it that we want to reform it Mr President I am absolutely in favour of competition we are clear but I always say that good competition must also be balanced with the protection of jobs in our country in line with national interests and not the interests of multinationals But that 's not all On the subject of immigration I have heard your statements recently you rightly pointed out that we are the most welcoming country in the world we can tell us we have done so much we have given examples of solidarity we have incessant numbers of arrivals Then at some point you also said that we have reached the limit Mr President if you say that we have reached the limit you will have to have a discontinuity on the immigration policies that your Government has so far pursued These are basically the themes Among other things Mr President it is useless for us to hide it but the present Parliament will arrive at the elections on which we understand it and understand it President substantially out of control Imagine nothing changes we arrive in September we start another pull and drop how do we do the national interest In the end a government should at least have the political strength to ensure that Parliament can fully support it That is why we need a new government with you in charge Mr President because we value it and because you are authoritative Because the Italians said he has to stay where he is The alternative the second possible scenario if the conditions of stability and strength I have just described were not to be verified would be the one that some analysts have highlighted these days there are people far more experienced than me there are precedents at the time of the Ciampi Government that the President of the Republic if she resigns can always dissolve the Chambers rejecting her resignation she would remain in office until the new Government with full powers which can of course be attributed to her without any problem and complete the reforms for the PNRR that serve the country make immediately a budget law that secures the national accounts and at that point finally give the word to the Italians who have been waiting for so long As you can see there is more than one way out of this crisis but of course there must be a great force of discontinuity that only its authority can give At this point Mr President it is up to you
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President I understand that on the left they are very sorry and have not yet recovered from yesterday 's news that the centre right has found the agreement They hoped that there would be division and instead this unit put them in serious difficulty Honestly I do not think I tell Comrade Parrini that journalistic inventions must be denied The election campaign has begun We do all the investigative committees we make all the acts available and we do whatever you want We know very well that it will be a campaign marked especially on the left to see the ugly and the bad with Salvini who says that we must dialogue with Putin In this regard I would remind you that several times Salvini has said that the Atlantic Alliance is not at all under discussion In addition Mr Macron an idol from the left of our country says that we must dialogue with Putin and Mr Scholz President of a Social Democratic Government whom you are proud to be the main protagonists So in the end we are not saying anything different than what two important leaders of Europe have said which of course have absolutely clear that we must look first at the interests of Europe which must come first Since you always mention entrepreneurs I invite you to go and talk to them not with those you read in the newspapers and I assure you that you will not find one who does not say that this war must end as soon as possible We are aiming at this otherwise the damage that is expected for the future is really a lot If we are so dependent on Russia 's gas today with all the consequences we must thank and I say this to Comrade Parrini your Secretary Mr Letta who was the President in Office of the Council who made the major agreements to make us dependent on Russia
ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President I would simply like to say that the Lega Group takes up the appeal made by the Brothers of Italy Group not so much for a second thought but because as I shall now explain the Lega has always consistently maintained in all fora that bathing concessions should be excluded from the Bolkestein Directive To do this we obviously need a European standard that goes in this direction and this is the right and appropriate delegation law to stimulate the European Union in this respect Another issue is the draft competition law which we voted for for a very simple reason we were faced with a decision of the Council of State that disenforced Law No 145 of 2018 which many of those who applauded before voted with us when they were at the government with us to say how much consistency is important and necessary and in the face of that decision of the Council of State with the risk of condemning our companies to an abusive occupation with all that it could achieve we had to intervene at the regulatory level to protect them also providing for the criteria of reward to prevent that from January 2023 the races could be highlighted even with the risk that foreign investors could come to appropriate our beaches We have therefore acted for protection and defence by voting in favour of the draft competition law with all the rewards and issues that I myself highlighted in this House in that speech On the other hand in view of the real and concrete possibility for Europe to re-examine this issue with regard to our ideas we will vote in favour of it and of course we support your amendment as a group bearing in mind another aspect that strengthens our vote in favour namely that there is a judgment since we had to act because of a decision of the Council of State of the TAR of Lecce which refers to the European Court of Justice the assessments on the applicability of the Bolkestein Directive to bathing concessions All the more reason for this vote to be in favour and indeed we are calling on Parliament to do justice in this area once and for all
BRIZIERELLI L- SP PSd Az Madam President ladies and gentlemen I would like to thank Senator Verducci for this important moment of sharing and of course as the Lega Group we also associate ourselves with the thinking for the Marches However it is not polemic but an appeal to those who will sit in these benches after us these words resonated in this House at every tragedy and never followed an act It is serious that Italy which between earthquakes and floods knows tragedies I do n't say every day but often has not had a national law for emergency management and that every time we have to start again applauding civil protection and volunteers In the words of my colleague Senator Verducci probably someone a little older than me will have also seen the angels of the mud of Florence in 1966 The problem is that not having a law for emergency management in 1966 was perhaps also plausible but not having it today is still a fault that I believe the entire national political institutional system carries on its shoulders I hope that the next Parliament will succeed in doing what we have not done because it is something that Italy needs regardless of colors and belongings and the country system
"Mr President I would like to make three fundamental points among the many results that we have brought home together The first I thank my colleague Marti who is here next to me because we have brought him home together is the extension until 30 September of the outdoor spaces for bars restaurants and public establishments which will be able to take advantage of the summer season of course after payment but they will be jobs they will have entered for the companies I think it is a way to support a production system towards restarting We were asked from all over Italy especially from the tourist resorts and art cities Another important result that looks to the future is that it will finally allow the Italian airfields there are more than 600 to create fuel distributors this can on the one hand reduce the impact of the costs of the fuel on the other allow to have greater safety but above all to develop a sector that abroad especially in Germany and Spain produces important repercussions on the territory The third result that I would like to stress out of respect I say that it has been signed by colleagues from all the parliamentary groups by majority and opposition with strong support also from the Government concerns the national system of environmental protection It was born in 2017 it is not the sum of individual bodies and regional environmental agencies but it is something more a network system Well there were two basic twists the first of which was on staff When people went to block public employment and recruitment of course we were not there it was done in a linear way and the municipalities know something about it Well the assumption of ARPAs has been blocked Now they can assume 25 more and go to fill up with fundamental figures such as engineers and specialized technicians what is needed to protect the environment safety health and to complete the PNRR given all the competences we have given to the ARPA doing so in a concrete way because to defend the environment it is not enough to insert it Constitution I would like a minute more time to highlight something that is not right despite the fact that the entire Parliament and the entire Government were in favour for a surreal interpretation of the State Accounting I ask the Presidency to listen carefully Under Law No. 68 of 2015 environmental crimes have been introduced in defense of all Well an important task has been given to ARPAs who have completed it there are many sanctions imposed despite the shortage of staff The ARPA imposed fines and collected them we speak of 3,177,000 euros in 2017 5,402,000 euros in 2018 4,489,000 euros in 2019 3,772,000 euros in 2020 2021 is missing but we speak in all of almost 20 million euros but they cannot spend because it says that the ARPA does the fines and collects them but it does n't say that the ARPA can spend There are therefore EUR 20 million that we could devote to environmental protection just as ASL collects safety fines on workers from those who do not respect safety and can spend them on the basis of Legislative Decree No. 758 of 1994 the same cannot be done by ARPAs There is still money and it is someone 's responsibility if we cannot spend money on health and environmental protection so let us also solve the issue of this second part of the amendment signed by everyone and which the State Accounting Office did not want us to approve on a purely interpretative issue"
Mr President it is useless to point out it would be LaPalissian how special and exceptional the moment is extending an emergency state is something that has no equal we have said it several times on this issue in Republican history The characteristics of a state of emergency are certainly gravity and exceptionality if exceptionality becomes ordinary administration then we are facing something else since we have dramatically compressed personal freedoms and have upset the lives of people families and businesses We therefore need the responsibility which brings us here today to vote in favour and which led us to the Commission yesterday to present an agenda which the League strongly wanted at the first signature of my colleague Mr Augussori the agenda with which the Government is asked to review with balance reasonableness and proportionality the rules that we have imposed on Italians The data go in a precise direction thanks to the responsibility of those who have not opposed simply one we close everything to one we open everything but has struggled as the League has done for the single norm for the single category for the single initiative Every extra day every activity a little more open or less closed changes people 's lives We therefore wanted an agenda yesterday and we have tabled amendments some of them have been accepted which go in this direction because even one day it can make a difference in loosening not only simple measures but a real loop around the neck often also on the economic side of many activities Another word that needs to be added is timeliness this must be done immediately and therefore we ask not only daily to be able to review the measures but also to do so today in this House I am taking the concrete example of an amendment which was rejected yesterday in the Commission but which as a League we have chosen to re-present which concerns some of the events to which we are all more attached and which from North to South unite our country It asked at the urging of the mayors to be able to loosen the measures in the white zone to allow demonstrations such as the procession of the candles of Gubbio in my region which took place for hundreds of years even during the war the women brought the candles on Mount Ingino and even the soldiers on Col di Tenda during the war did a small procession The amendment also concerns the Palio di Siena the procession of Santa Rosalia in Palermo and all the processions of the other cities such as the festivals of the large shoulder machines declared UNESCO heritage in Sassari Palmi Nola Viterbo and other places Giving the mayors the possibility of simplified procedures for these demonstrations in the white zone means going in a direction of reopening and restarting our country The Government has given an opinion against it the amendment has been rejected and we have retabled it in this House Then I would ask the Government to reflect on it further in the time of the general discussion and to review the opinion I will ask of course with the permission of my Parent Company to vote on that amendment anyway Then I address myself as well as to the Government to change its opinion also to colleagues in Tuscany Sicily Sardinia and all the regions where events such as those outlined take place which for hundreds of years have represented our tradition giving up tradition is the first step to give up oneself and its history to vote in favour of this amendment anyway If we say here in words that the constraints and procedures must be limited and reduced we must also do so in everyday life Some might say that it may not be extended next time but let 's start today What do we tell the citizens of Noto about the procession in San Corrado on February 19 Do they or do n't they What will we say to the citizens of Gubbio for the Crystal Festival scheduled for May Can they start working on it or not Let 's give a signal and let 's start with our tradition and our essence If the government does not do so I hope that Parliament can claim it and do so
BRIZIERELLI L- SP PSd Az Mr President I repeat my vote in favour and call on all my colleagues to reflect on the vote First of all what are we talking about Only manifestations of recognized interest only in the white zone including dynamic ones and therefore in motion We did the Sanremo Festival indoors without a mask and we listened to President Mattarella say to Parliament claim your role and express yourself on something Let me ask colleagues a question If the government were to maintain the opposite opinion is this Parliament not even able to express itself on the demonstrations that have been taking place in this country for hundreds of years during the war with epidemics and under invasion I 'd say that 's not the case I would ask colleagues from all the groups regardless of other positions and amendments to put a hand on their consciences because when they return to their territories they will have to explain themselves They are in fact demonstrations that take place throughout Italy and will have to explain to the citizens why again this year for the third consecutive year certain demonstrations will not be made despite the fact that they are going towards reopening
"BRIZIERELLI L- SP PSd Az Mr President I have asked to speak in order to bring to your attention and to the attention of the House what has been happening since yesterday afternoon and is still happening in the former Malagrotta dump It is a huge fire devastating which first involved a shed then the still gasifier then the conveyor belt and finally the entire mechanical biological treatment system TMB It is a plant that treats 900 of the 3,000 tons a day that Rome produces It is obvious therefore that the first thought goes to the people who have been torn apart for years in that area which I would like to remind you is the only one in Central and South which is subject to the Seveso dioxin directive I would ask for some respect not so much for me but for the population and for the more than 40 firemen who are trying to control a fire that seems indomitable in these hours They have intervened and are still intervening first eight then 12 and then 16 means even special of firefighters It is these hours a draconian order of the mayor of Rome that establishes a zone of respect of 6 kilometers closes the kindergartens schools prohibits the consumption of food asks the people who are one kilometer from the plant to stay locked in the house The first thought goes to them but then there are two fundamental considerations that we have a duty to carry out The first is that it is the third fire of a waste treatment plant in four years in Rome On December 11 2018 a fire completely destroyed the TMB salary which at that time contained 3,000 tons of garbage for three days the cameras did not work who knows why a disaster announced On March 24 2019 a fire hit the TMB of Rocca Cencia which contained almost 500 tons in that case the cameras were not even there as there was no smoke detection system These tragedies are announced on which we have also acted and asked for attention as a Commission of Inquiry into the illicit activities related to the waste cycle and the related environmental offences The second consideration concerns the plants in Rome and Lazio It is not just a question of understanding where we are going to bring 900 tonnes of waste from now on which risks bringing waste management to its knees in Rome but of understanding why we are still stuck to a waste management plan that is that of the Polverini junta because the plan for the management of the plant has just been approved even if Zingaretti has been president since 2013 Someone must explain to us also because it is Parliament 's duty to intervene if a Region does not succeed how one can on the one hand unanimously approve the request for Rome Capital to enter into the Constitution and then not be able to provide it with a waste management plant worthy of a civil country and have a political force like the 5 Stars crying out for scandal and threatening a crisis of government because an amendment has been inserted that provides special powers and rapid times to realize a thermovaluer in Lazio in Rome before the Jubilee Let us have some consistency let us do what every Italian citizen has the right to have In order to protect the environment it is not enough to write it in the Constitution in order to protect health from dioxin risk it is not enough to say it in words the facts are needed it is necessary to move to a serious plant in Rome Lazio and throughout the country"
BRIZIERELLI L- SP PSd Az Mr President I am announcing the withdrawal of Amendment 7.3 but I am asking the Government for an additional control and attention Forest carabinieri are also used in the checks for the respect of the super green pass It is clear that as detailed in the Commission forest carabinieri are public security agents The point is not this but that among the ordinary functions assigned to the Body there is that of control of general public order Beyond the provisions of the circular some regional commanders and the General Command had raised the possibility of employing under applicable law the agents of the Forest Carabinieri for this function with reference to the aspect of tranquility and safety of the use of these units The amendment inserting and expressly quoting the members of the Forestry Corps was intended to give a cover to these agents of our Forces of Order in the services that we ask them to apply So beyond the part of the coverage already planned I withdraw the amendment we would miss it but I ask the Government to check that those servants of the State are performing those functions in peace for all because otherwise it would be a problem We make an extra effort assigning them to a different task we make sure that they can do so safely for the citizens and for themselves
"BRIZIERELLI L- SP PSd Az Mr President I am speaking about an area of exotic animals which has thousands of farms and tens of thousands of workers and which could cease to exist on 8 May because of Parliament 's error To be clear we are not talking about tigers pandas and all those animals that are guaranteed and protected by the Washington Convention which Italy signed in 1975 but about fish aquariums parrots and canaries which for the most part are not even imported but bred by very Italian companies which risk being outlawed by us This is not for a European regulation but for a rule that we impose on ourselves and that no other European country has adopted and that concerns import marketing and conservation To give some figures only the Italian Federation of Orniculturists counts 20,000 breeders who in the last year have ringed 1.7 million specimens of which a third exotic There is a national association that collects Italian companies that breed parrots we speak of 160 companies and 20,000 specimens but it concerns for example specialized veterinarians and doctors who adopt and use parrots in the management of selective mutism of children All of this unfortunately could be outlawed For a year now we have been trying as a League to replace the specific ban that we have delegated to the Government by regulation We are absolutely in favour of greater health controls and of the quality of life of animals this is not in question however we do not understand why millions of Italians who have as an animal of affection an exotic specimen must be placed on a different plane from those who may have a dog or a cat with a damage of billions This is only because of the ideological approach of a part of environmentalists who are at risk of not protecting the environment of not favouring animals which could even be dispersed in habitats that are not their own even more accustomed and with the risk of haunting them and instead of favouring the zoomafias and illegal imports against which for example Legambiente is fighting What we are asking for given that the delegation expires on 8 May and that this issue should be dealt with in the next Council of Ministers is that every political force of those that had already spoken last year introduces yes a regulation but not a ban The appeal to the government therefore since there are a few days left is to correct our mistake and there is an amendment in this sense presented by the League also to the current delegation law because it is okay to protect but not destroy the economy without protecting the environment and animals"
Mr President in these terms I welcome the transformation of the agenda I am speaking out of respect not only for the House in particular for the Members of all the Groups who have signed the amendment but for all those who are waiting for an intervention on the subject of drought outside the Chamber not only for the citizens the categories and in particular the farmers and the tourism sector but also for the local authorities and the regions who alone cannot deal with such an issue The theme of water together with that of energy is not a theme it is the theme from here to the future In this decree there is only one article which was recovered from what was to be the decree drought which the Government as a whole even with the support of the opposition should have submitted We can't just take care of the damage and redo it We need to work in prevention to prevent and understand what can happen The government had proposed a technical table In the election campaign a technical table may be useful but I believe that it is more just and more correct for an entire Parliament to express itself and in front of the country make a commitment to the next Government in a framework that looks to the future and sees us at least on a subject like this all united and committed Of course everyone looks at their territory I look at the Trasimeno others look at the Po the lakes or the rivers and at a problem that is really common For this reason I believe that we need on the one hand seriousness but on the other also responsibility and courage to express themselves on this That is why I call for the House to express itself and vote so that those who wish to put this issue as an item on the priority agenda from here to the future will remain in the record
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President allow me at the beginning of my speech to join in the thanks to the rapporteurs Senators Calderoli and Santangelo for the work they have done congratulations which I extend to all the members of the Junta and in particular to those of the Committee which took part in its work for the excellent positive and collaborative climate that took place during the work itself Finally Mr President we have all appreciated the wise guidance and style in which you have addressed us over the last few months knowing that you are firm if necessary but also flexible in ensuring full autonomy for the Committee so that it can operate in the most productive and profitable way possible Thank you President As we know the reform of the Senate Rules has become necessary as a result of the constitutional change that has reduced the number of senators from the next legislature to 200 It is not clear that this is the right place to make judgements about the reform but what is certain is that the many positive aspects of the reform risk being in vain if not destabilizing if it is not accompanied by a corresponding amendment to our Rules of Procedure that it cannot only be that of a proportion of the various numerical parameters but that it must also reorganize the functioning of some bodies in this branch of Parliament the standing committees on all It was decided to reduce their number to ten because the current 14 format would lead to a poor and problematic composition of each of them The necessary adjustments are based on thematic affinity criteria but also on the workloads of each of them The two filter committees 1a and 5a and 2a which are among others the most burdened by the number of acts dealt with are left unchanged For the current 3rd 4th and 14th it was preferred to leave the European policies autonomous thus bringing together foreign affairs and defence which are among those which given to the hand have to date fewer tasks Agriculture flows with productive activities territory and environment with the Commission on public works finally health with the Commission work and welfare The occasion of the revision of the Regulation was also and above all useful to do the cutting al though excellent articulated that we use daily The 2017 reform produced a slender Regulation easy to interpret which allowed our work to proceed smoothly and smoothly with clear advantage on the quality of legislative production The practical application during this parliamentary term has shown that it works well but it has also highlighted the areas where it is perfect The Junta proposes therefore some corrections in this regard and others to respond to some distortions that the political framework in continuous and dynamic evolution has produced A new body the Legislative Committee is set up drawing on the existing one in the Chamber of Deputies Article 4 provides for an interesting novelty concerning the Parliamentary Committee on Regional Affairs providing for the possibility of inviting representatives of the Regions the Autonomous Provinces and the local authorities to participate in the meetings of the Commission itself in relation to specific measures This is an important signal of attention to local realities that fits in with the irreversible and untenable action that started with the referendum on autonomy of 22 October 2017 At the same time it is envisaged that the European Union 's Political Commission may invite Members of the European Parliament to participate without the right to vote in its meetings in relation to specific measures On the other hand we are putting forward at least three important amendments to facilitate our work particularly in the Commission First of all there is greater clarity in the arrival and transposition of the amended decrees in the Commission to the House The amendments adopted will be incorporated directly into the text the so called Annex A and will no longer have to be voted on by the Assembly as Commission amendments The examination of the decrees is therefore equal to that of ordinary drafts of law with two obvious advantages Mr President it is very difficult to speak
Please Senator Augussori Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Thank you Mr President I would say that there will be two obvious advantages greater clarity of the text and more streamlined work in this House as a result of the fewer votes needed Secondly it is envisaged that the filter committees Constitutional Affairs and Budget Committees should express their opinion only on the amendments adopted and therefore downstream of the Commission 's work on the substance and no longer upstream of all the amendments which have sometimes been tabled in an instrumental and massive manner and with subsequent texts 2 3 4 etc This will enable the work of the Budget Commission to be considerably lightened with the important possibility of applying greater discernment on the truly significant amendments and will bring greater fluidity to the Commission 's work on the substance which today is too often subject to continuous stops and go and to the results of what is a genuine roulette The third amendment which is probably the most important political amendment provides that the Budget Commission should no longer be required to give an opinion against the amendments to which the technical report does not come From the next legislature in fact the Government will be required to transmit the technical report within five days of the request If this is not transmitted there is no more automatism which involves the presumption of honesty or lack of coverage but it will be the Commission that evaluates it in full autonomy as it is right that it is in a sovereign Parliament It comes to fall therefore the alibi behind which the Ministries were used to hide so as not to allow the discussion of unpleasing themes Let us therefore return to reaffirming the supremacy of the elected of the people over the bureaucrats of state A final chapter of the reform is aimed at countering the misconception of those who once elected relocate from one group to another as shipwrecked in continuous search of the landing place on a happy island A number of disincentives including economic ones are put in place to counter this practice As an example of what is happening in the European Parliament the figure of the non-attached to any group is also expected for the elected senators who are now only in use for those under the rule of law This means that those who by abandoning their Group cannot join another Group let alone the Mixed Group are classified as such Those who are expelled from their Group will be granted three days to join an existing Group Non-members will be guaranteed areas of intervention and participation in the Commissions but not the economic prerogatives provided for the Groups It is also expected to be more rigid for the formation of new groups and components of the Mixed with clear and non-negotiable criteria with the typical alchemies of the First Republic The new wording provides that new groups may be formed only if they are composed of 9 senators instead of 6 as we have seen will be the new ordinary minimum number representative of a party or political movement of which they take the mark which in the legislature has submitted its own candidates to the parliamentary elections or to the European Parliament resulting in the election of its own representatives Therefore the new groups can only be set up at real parties Other changes always aimed at discouraging transformation provide that the decline from office is extended to the Quaestors and to all members of the Councils With regard to the Assembly of Elections and Immunities the allocation of the Presidency to a representative of the opposition is strengthened stating that this condition must continue throughout the term of office under penalty of forfeiture and not only occur at the time of election Finally Article 5 presents a final provision always aimed at discouraging transfers to another parliamentary group in which it is envisaged to amend the discipline of contributions to the Groups both to curb the phenomenon of mobility concerned and to achieve savings in expenditure for the Senate I 'm gonna do a little writing ma'am I sincerely regret what happened just now to the amendment tabled by Mr Maiorino the reformulated text was genuinely balanced our Group supported it and on the request for a secret vote as we have seen it did not give support We voted in favour of the amendment but I regret to see what has happened in this House namely that the necessary quorum has not been reached Too bad years and years of struggles were thrown into the basket I would point out however that in the field of the enlarged centre left alone wide field wide field as you wish I have found the absence of 18 senators I wo n't name them Anyone who wants can look for them Well I have to say that battles right or wrong and this is a fair battle are fought and won on the ground Otherwise it 's mere demagogy Obviously those 18 senators do n't have to account to me we would miss but they will have to make it to their electricians if anything In conclusion Mr President we believe that this report as dismissed by the Junta is an excellent text and given that the amending phase in this House has further improved enhanced and enhanced it I strongly express the support of the Lega Group
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President I will speak much more briefly than I would have liked given the situation in our work to express the satisfaction of the Lega Group for the adoption of this amendment in the Commission which aims to restore full protection to the fragile and to defer the application of the interministerial decree which would have reduced the protected categories It was a difficult and complex work in the Commission a positive success also thanks to the contribution of all the other Groups expected by many people who fall into these unfortunate categories It is regrettable to point out once again unfortunately that after intensive and fruitful work in the Commission when we are examining this House we always find ourselves faced with a difficulty posed by the State Accounting Office which tends to prevail over the will expressed by the representatives of the people We have already said several times that we believe that this is not a good thing and the invitation I make to all the Groups is to find decisive and decisive solutions to prevent bureaucrats from controlling politicians
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President I too would like to join in the invitation to deliver a written text but having no written text I cannot help but recall that this decree was born in mid-December at the height of the pandemic Thus it served to give a round of lives and to give greater protection for what then occurred namely an impressive peak of the contagions Luckily many intensive therapies have had a much lower growth than in the past and this is also thanks to vaccines and we must remember that As however there has been responsibility on the part of a large part of Parliament also on the part of my Group to acknowledge the need for this round of lives we ask that with equal fairness and equal responsibility the other part of Parliament also acknowledge that a new phase is now beginning A phase begins when certain restrictive measures need to be relaxed starting with the super green pass because we can finally see the light outside the tunnel If the data of the last few weeks are confirmed we can say that finally the emergent pandemic phase will be exceeded and we can be part of the ordinary management phase That is our wish As far as the decree law is concerned I can only mention briefly the improving action we have taken in the Commission on issues such as those of fragile workers and air purifiers for schools as well as the important agenda also mentioned by our Parent Company which has committed the Government to identifying the relaxation of restrictive measures starting from the overcoming of the super green pass My group will therefore vote in favour of this measure
"Mr President Minister ladies and gentlemen unfortunately today is still not a good day for thousands of so called fragile workers This is because since March 31 with the just and sacrosanct cessation of the state of emergency the safeguards put in place to preserve this category of people have also ceased These are the safeguards provided for in Article 26 of Decree Law No 18 of March 2020 the so called care Italy They concern employees public and private immunodepressed or with oncology or life saving treatment as well as those with the recognition of serious disability I think you know them better than we do Paragraph 2 a provides that they may carry out the work in agile mode also through the provision of a different job The paragraph 2 has previewed that for those for which it is impossible to activate the smart working the absence from the service is allowed not counted for the purposes of the period of composing The two provisions have been extended several times Finally Decree Law No 221 of last December extended its effects until 31 March 2022 These people have now been called back to work in the presence Even if the state of emergency has ended the Covid 19 however has not disappeared and as you know we record even more than 50,000 infections every day Exposing these people to travel by public transport and to the presence with colleagues and users puts them at serious risk even considering that part of them is not vaccinated or if it is may not enjoy full antibody coverage That is what all the virologists say the more rightly we loosen the restrictions the more we should protect those at risk the older and fragile Restoring the usual protections also means abandoning the list of super raids of the interministerial decree of 4 February a list that has never had a concrete application and it is good that you specify this Minister also because some public administrations are erroneously implementing it Another issue related to the condition of fragile workers relates to the INPS sickness benefit only within pre-defined time limits The right to receive the allowance must be recognised throughout the period of absence from service so it has not been and many people have lived without receiving anything for months Identical problems are also encountered for workers who have been recognized as temporarily unfit We therefore ask you Minister what initiatives you intend to take in order to extend the protection of fragile workers until the development of the epidemiological situation so requires to enable them to receive the sickness benefit throughout the period of absence from service and to extend these protections also to the unfit workers"
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President I will speak briefly to declare the vote on behalf of my Group because we are not for the first time faced with a somewhat surreal situation I would say even embarrassing We are called today to decide how to do some things but they have already happened With the decree law that we are called to convert we should decide how the ballot box should be inserted into the urn how many signatures it takes to submit a list to the local elections how the seats should be sanitized and I could continue indefinitely It 's all happened before This can only depress Parliament 's role even more I can tell you that we are at second reading and that now with mono cameralism in fact the second reading is a bureaucratic passage but in reality the first reading in the House has taken place at things already done after the Sunday of voting of the referendum and the first round We are even dealing with this decree law after the ballots have already taken place and this is not good I repeat it is not good it is serious because Mr President if Parliament had been involved and there was a way and time to do so since as some colleagues have pointed out before the decree law is from the first days of May and therefore there were even forty days to be able to examine and intervene we could have helped the government to avoid certain figures Let us think for example of the masks in the seats I recall briefly the question three days or four days before the vote a circular of the Ministries of Interior and Health on health protocols provided for the masks within the voting sections Attention not within the seats buildings and schools but within the sections it was sent to the presidents to check An obnoxious I assume that many of you have gone to vote sometime and we know well therefore that the assembly is out not when you enter one at a time in the voting section Those who have written this rule can therefore at least be accused of institutional ignorance The beauty is that these masks were delivered to the seats by the Government they arrived to the prefectures the prefectures sent them to the municipalities and the latter to the voting sections Well this little game cost citizens EUR 6 million Masks which at last were no longer necessary but were bought and distributed so we think not only about the living cost of matter but also about all the work that has been done Who 's paying Do you always pay Pants or pay Minister Lamorgese and Minister Hope I would like to point out another politically much more serious issue the choice to vote only on Sundays The Government indeed the Presidency of the Council in recent months has done an excellent job with a committee of experts and has produced the White Paper on abstentionism entitled For the participation of citizens How to reduce abstentionism and facilitate voting Some ways of encouraging participation and reducing abstentionism are identified by the Government President do you know what is the first and most important Vote in two days This is what the government says to reduce abstentionism it is necessary to vote on Sunday and Monday What does Minister Lamorgese do We only vote on Sundays It is not a choice dictated by other reasons by other logics I can not possibly avoid the costs of the scruters No the government knows that voting on two days reduces abstentionism and therefore the government or rather Minister Lamorgese decides to vote in one day just to facilitate abstentionism and reduce the possibility of reaching quorum in the referendum Political choice which I would not have expected from a minister who declares himself technical But now Minister Lamorgese is no surprise at a number of things Just to say one where is it There is one measure of yours in this House but the Minister is not there Although I am worthyly represented by the Undersecretary whom I thank for the cooperation presence and help he has given us in the Commission I would have expected to see the Minister here and not to see him only when President Draghi is here for sitting by his side for the photos I would have expected Minister Lamorgese to hear from his voice some explanation of what happened in Palermo directly or indirectly it is the responsibility of the Minister of the Interior if the electoral machine does not work and in Palermo it did not work He must also explain why unlike what other colleagues from other countries might have done he chose not to resign for what happened Anyway nothing surprises us anymore Mr Lamorgese does little if nothing is as firm motionless and static as a traffic light at a crossroads green light for the illegals red light for all about democracy In conclusion Mr President we are voting in favour of this confidence only because of institutional duty and on the substance of the matter so that the effects of the decree law do not lapse
"Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President the approach of the measure to the House shows that Parliament is increasingly paying attention to the small municipalities or to say the least to the vast majority of them the fantastic panorama of 8,000 bell towers whose typicality cannot be confused and distorted by the need for a handful of metropolis We come to the House thanks to an effort by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which has been able to deal with the measure very quickly since it received from the House the bill Pella combining it here with the bill of the League for a long time on the agenda of our Commission I cannot fail to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on all of them Mr Parrini and the Brothers of Italy Group who following an agreement made themselves available to withdraw their amendments We could say that this is a small reform which allows the third consecutive mandate only to the mayors of the municipalities from 3,000 to 5,000 inhabitants like the lower belt but it is very significant of the trend we are running It is confirmed that it is more effective to proceed for punctual interventions some even mini rather than waiting in vain for the birth of a general maxi-reform that might never see the light at least in this legislature We owe it to the mayors first of all because being mayor is getting harder and harder Those of us who have not been in this position recently find it hard to understand that it is probably even more challenging than being a Member of Parliament Only in recent months have the mayors in addition to all that they already did had to face the enormous responsibilities for the management of the pandemic the numerous PNRR calls to be prepared with few employees and municipal secretaries missing and the disproportionate increase of the energy costs and raw materials necessary for ordinary maintenance extraordinary and new investments to the point that it often becomes impossible to close the forecast budgets except for an increase in local taxes which is highly hateful at a time when citizens already suffer increases in bills and problems of work as a result of lockdown Finally even more recently they face the reception of refugees from Ukraine Today however this is an intervention not only in favour of the mayors but mainly aimed at the electoral citizens who will have the opportunity if they wish to be represented by someone with experience and skills matured in ten years who will not be so dispersed Today 's is joined by other interventions in the field Firstly the allowances increased and updated although it is necessary to remember that the Government with the intervention in the budget law penalized the small ones with respect to the draft parliamentary law We must absolutely commit ourselves to correcting what has been done and we must also update the section on work permits Secondly the civil and criminal liability of the mayors I always take the example of the mayor who is at trial for murder for a rock fallen from a mountain path The measure is proceeding not very quickly in the Joint Committees on Constitutional Affairs and Justice We have to give it back and finish before the summer The subject is very sensitive and cannot be addressed in the somewhat clumsy way that is present in the hypothesis of reform of the TUEL proposed by the prefects of the Ministry led by Minister Lamorgese The issue cannot be resolved by a horizontal transfer to the administrative structure also shifting risk with responsibility If there is no motivation and above all the one that can have the chosen one is missing then paralysis is at risk I remember that the medium small municipalities have problems of shortage and quality of staff the employees are missing because in the years when there was money to hire the state has blocked the hiring and now that you can hire there is no more money because either you pay the increases or you pay the bills The assumption of responsibility on the part of the managers is feasible only where the managers are there Who have you ever seen the executives in the small municipalities Then there is the whole issue of the provincial bodies following the failed reform of the Delrio law and there is the whole game of the missing municipal secretaries whose deficiency paralyzes the administrative activity It goes on with the bits with the deputy secretaries with the secretaries to climb over with the secretaries shared among 10 municipalities you can't work in this way it 's not civilized country The solution cannot even be that of the associated managements You all know of the criticism of the ANCI to which was added yesterday the rejection of the National Association of Small Municipalities of Italy ANPCI Now the mayors after managing a pandemic must manage the arrival of the refugees do magic with the budget in order to be able to pay everything without knowing what will happen if the war does not end and the principle of guilt is still valid to them Without respecting the judgment of the Constitutional Court the reform says in practice that a mayor of a small municipality must prove that he is not an incompetent person and that he is able to provide adequate services to citizens on the basis of which criteria it is not known or is obliged to associate It is madness the result of a centralist and borbonic vision When Covid was there and the mayors were on the front line alone no one wondered if they were able alone and with the employees unfortunately at home to help their people On the other hand we must give confidence to local administrators and therefore we must take steps like this and believe me that there are very few mayors in the second term now who are swaying to do the third under these conditions In conclusion the Lega Group will vote strongly in favour of this draft law because we are going in the right direction but there is still a long way to go Certainly when there are still vital issues for local authorities the League will be at the forefront and ready also to play a role of pungolo to give the right gratitude to those people who give up their professional and personal life to make themselves available to their community To the mayors of any political color we say that the League is and will always be at their side 18.18 p.m."
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President on the agenda G1100 which was approved by the Commission which was first signed by me following the withdrawal of amendment 1.4 again by the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group at my first signature I would ask you as has already been the case in the Commission to put the agenda to the vote in order to give greater strength to the message contained in it The agenda under discussion is a commitment that is being asked of the Government which has allowed it to be given and therefore the vote is an act that gives more force to the Commission itself in carrying out its commitment relating to compensation for any damage caused by recommended vaccinations We know that compulsory vaccines provide compensation in the event of damage With the recent measures imposed by the Government has extended the audience of persons subject to vaccination obligation which is close to 30 million I do not have an exact figure including all over fifty and all persons engaged in the health system law enforcement and education who are covered by the law providing compensation At the moment people who do not have an obligation are still excluded but have a strong recommendation to vaccination It is a battle that as a Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione we have carried on since the beginning of the vaccination campaign We have tabled this amendment over and over again which unfortunately has never been successful This time also by virtue of a decision of the Constitutional Court the rest of the parliamentary groups joined our initiative and as you have seen wrote through their Leader the signature on this agenda resulting from amendment 1.4 It is fair to say that there were also other amendments by the other majority and opposition forces as Mr Malan said So there was a strong convergence There were therefore all the conditions for approving the amendment already in the measure under consideration Unfortunately again due to a lack of some technicians from the Ministry of Economics and Finance or Accounting we have not yet quite understood it it has not been possible to improve the coverage in good time So let 's refer to the next useful measure which the Government will take next week on this there is a clear commitment from the Government at the highest level We therefore believe that the agenda is a very good success because the issue will be resolved next week even before the possible conversion of the decree law in question which could take place in the House of Deputies in seven days time It is therefore the shortest route which allows us to solve a problem which is attended by so many citizens So the government 's commitment is clear The hope is that it will be confirmed and that justice will be done for those who are damaged by a vaccine which has been strongly suggested and recommended by the State
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President although we agree with the spirit of this amendment which is a worthy and commendable act we will still vote against it and I want to clearly explain why it would not otherwise be understandable Amendment 2.0.4 text 3 which absorbed 2.0.5 text 3 originally required a day's leave for certain categories of public workers those of central functions to be allowed to go to the vaccine In a first rewording this permission was extended to all employees of the public administration and in the third rewording at our request also to the private sector The Government accepted the reformulation and gave a favourable opinion on the proposal to allow the day of leave in a fair manner for workers in the public and private sectors Unfortunately then as often happens during the examination in the Budget Commission MEF General Accounting and so on the usual coverage problems have arisen and we have returned to an earlier version It is a good thing that civil servants are allowed to exercise their right obligation to immunise themselves but we do not want to see any disparity With the approval of this amendment we will have workers in private with a vaccination obligation who will have to take a day off in order to immunize themselves if they cannot find a slot available on Sunday or on their day of rest and we understand that those who have the vaccination obligation have the obvious need to do so as soon as possible At the same time employees of the public who do not belong to subjects with vaccination obligation may benefit from a day 's leave not one or two hours at the expense of the community We believe that this choice is unfair We would like the same treatment for the workers of the public and those of the private sector If that is not possible we would prefer equality unfortunately to fall we do not want children and stepchildren public workers of the A and private workers of the B series
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President I think there is some problem with the file PRESIDENT The debate is We are talking about page 57 of the amendment file I have the additional amendment 5.0.6 text 2 which the Presidency considers available only if referred to in Article 4 Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President I can inform you of the inconsistencies that I note The G4.2 agenda which was presented by Senator Parente and on which we had stopped earlier was actually voted by the Commission and should be referred to as the Commission's It is what created misunderstanding with the rapporteur who clearly did not see it marked as the Commission 's agenda Then there are other missing days orders in Article 5 I would point out that Amendment 5.0.6 which was rejected by the Commission appeared to me to be withdrawn from the House and not moved PRESIDENT The debate is closed Let us talk about Amendment 5.0.6 Amendment 5.6 is partly inadmissible Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Amendment 5.6 has been withdrawn text 1 Text 2 has been transformed into an agenda which has been approved and has disappeared but we will see it later because it refers to Article 5 Amendment 5.0.6 which you are now moving to Article 4 has been rejected by the Commission this is the well known issue of parapharmacies You now put it back to the vote but it was in the process of being withdrawn That was the commitment I think it was well known to the government PRESIDENT The debate is closed I did n't withdraw it and I was referring to propriety Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az So if we put it to the vote I think it is appropriate to suspend the work for ten minutes
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President as I was anticipating earlier there are problems in Article 5 In other words there are amendments which have been transformed into agendas which are missing in the file I am referring to Senator Parente 's amendment 5.3 the amendment to be voted on remains in the file but in fact it has been withdrawn turned into an agenda and approved The same is true of Senator Vitali 's amendment 5.5 with the famous table which at the request of the Government has been transformed into an agenda and then accepted It 's not in the text Then there are the amendments 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 and 5.10 of which the text 1 has remained in the dossier which has actually been exceeded by a text 2 which has been transformed into five agendas all of which have been adopted Therefore for Article 5 the file is completely wrong
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President Amendment 5.6 is clearly partially inadmissible and that is why a text 2 was tabled The same applies to identical amendments by the other groups Having no interest in the adoption of the first text here and being satisfied with the inclusion of the agenda in the Commission I could turn it into an agenda to be accepted here too but we do not unnecessarily delay the time having already been a step in the Commission I also suggest that other groups do the same We withdraw amendment 5.6 the others can withdraw the subsequent amendments
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President I shall make a very brief explanation of vote because I do not want to abuse your patience We have already extensively argued in the Commission why we maintain this deleterious amendment and we are calling for it to be voted on The transitional rule that transforms white areas into yellow areas in Christmas holidays is the only point that our movement even in government has not fully shared Our three ministers have made a reservation so our amendment is a consequence We intend to vote for this deleterious amendment because we believe that Brusio All right I 'll go ahead anyway Thanks for your help We believe that this article this transitional passage goes to diminish the action of the Government and make it ineffective because the action of the Government has been meritorious in identifying the colored areas the famous yellow white orange red and so on and the citizens have learned to adjust accordingly Hence proper behavior on the part of the citizen gets a rewarding result If the government with this article 6 temporarily decides to suppress the premium situation let me say this a little special the attention of the citizen to conduct a proper behavior is lacking because it understands that there is no longer a logic of stick and carrot but only of stick and stick So the attention of the citizen is indifferent From this point of view in order not to deny the government 's political line we believe that Article 6 is wrong and we maintain the deletion amendment
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az But let me just say one thing Mr President We are voting in favour of the measure having already voted on other issues related to the pandemic I would like to remind you that the position of the League is expressed by official votes as on this occasion Where on the other hand and this also happened in this sitting by addressing the measure our Group critically expresses itself on some passages of the measures it does so as has been said several times only in order to avoid the promulgation of useless and vexatory norms which have no effect on the health framework but which could only produce exasperation and social tension It is an issue that should not be underestimated and it is a clear example of the threats coming from the extreme wing of the galaxy no vax expressed with the sending of bullets to the president of Trentino Alto Adige Maurizio Fugatti and with the social insults to the undersecretary for the job and social policies Tiziana Nisini to which of course all our solidarity goes trusting that it will also be collected from the rest of Parliament I see however that this is an in vain invitation Mr President I therefore confirm the support of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group
Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President I rise to point out to the House a subject that is very close to our Group 's heart but I also believe in many other colleagues here I am referring to the issue of fragile workers Unfortunately in the re-opening decree- law published in the Official Journal on March 24 the famous hand struck again In the draft that we have all seen and that was on the press there was a specific article aimed at making the protection of fragile workers continue for goodness sake drafts can not be trusted but I did a check with the Ministers present at the Council of Ministers who assure me that I voted on that text Unfortunately that article has disappeared in the Official Journal This is not the first time that this happens it is always very serious but this time it is even more so because it hits really weak people in difficulty The problem is said to be economic Over the last few weeks billions have been found for the expensive bills huge resources have been found to cut excise duty on petrol we have rightly found funds to increase the allocation for arms we have rightly found funds for Ukrainian refugees but the MEF does not find 70 million for fragile workers Moreover the norm in Decree Law No 24 of 2022 was not the maximum it was not optimal but it was limited only to so called superragiles so it reduced the audience and guaranteed only the smart working but not the absence protected for those who cannot do smart working It would in any case have been an insufficient rule but we could have improved it at the time of parliamentary conversion Now instead from 1 April from the day after tomorrow these people are called to work in presence We are talking about cancer patients immunodepressants on which the vaccine has no effect people with severe respiratory diseases At this stage when with reopenings rightly and finally we return to circulation more free the virus has not disappeared and still risks hitting these people who have no defenses We cannot wait two months for parliamentary conversion to remedy this it is not true that it takes twenty days as a 5 Star Member said on television yesterday it does not happen in twenty days it takes two months We demand that the government intervene immediately We need a corrective measure from the Government that must arrive as soon as possible if not today or tomorrow because from 1 April these people return to the presence and risk their lives
"Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen undersecretary Vezzali today we are discussing at third reading the proposal to include sport as one of the values protected by our Constitution After the first two readings concluded with a large majority approval the third passage and then the fourth in the Chamber of Deputies are not a useless bureaucratic harp but a clear representation planned and wanted by the constituent Fathers useful to show that the will of Parliament is firm and convinced However the opportunity is also useful to reaffirm the thanks of politics to the world of sport for everything it puts in place to allow the growth of the sociality and well being of the entire population of the country and in particular of the new generations Our thanks must reach everyone the Italian National Olympic Committee CONI the Paralympic Committee sports federations promotion agencies tens of thousands of sports clubs valuable volunteers technicians managers judges and referees and above all athletes whether they are professionals amateurs or mere amateurs they are the protagonists of this fantastic world We recognize the educational social and promotional value of the psychophysical well being of sports activity in all its forms In doing so we recognize that sport is unequivocally a characteristic element of our society that it is present almost in every family and that it enters every day in every house if not with the sports activity exercised directly at least with the attention and passion of those who appreciate and follow a team or an athlete For children and teenagers the athlete often takes on the role of model but it must be positive and for this reason we appreciate the efforts made to promote fair play We are satisfied that the wording chosen is the one indicated by our bill using the words sport activities instead of sports gives a wider meaning which refers not only to physical expression exercised in an organized and regulated way but to every activity carried out even in an autonomous way by the individual that is put in place to gain psychophysical benefit Here I refer to the only slightly stunned aspect that we have already had the opportunity to emphasize in the past and on which therefore I do not dwell much We would have liked the amendment to be included in Article 32 which deals with health precisely to highlight the importance of sport for the purposes of psychophysical well being a fundamental element in the growth of adolescents but also for the vital maintenance of older generations without forgetting the fundamental contribution that sport brings to the world of disability especially as a channel to stimulate sociality and integration Article 33 was chosen thus giving greater emphasis to the educational aspect certainly legitimate choice being the other pillar that supports the importance of sport practice We are sure that it was not an easy choice so there is no willingness on our part to blame those colleagues who supported it Being unable to create an article 32 and a half we can debrief the fact in simple nuance in a context definitely and widely positive We also find positivity in the fact that we have remedied a gap that we had compared to many other nations which in a more far sighted way have provided for a long time Certainly it is understandable that our Constitutional Charter had not foreseen it since its birth in 1948 the constituent Fathers still had before their eyes the instrumental and functional use of the acceptance of the fascist regime of the previous two decades but to wait over seventy years to recognize the social value and popularity of the phenomenon was actually so much if not too much This is why our intention in presenting the bill was not to celebrate the valuable results of sport of excellence it is indeed a way to emphasize that Olympic medals are not achieved unless there is a model of society that starts from below protecting and promoting sport activity and practice Sport is aggregation respect for the rules fight against youth deviance and social distress it is prevention in the health field it is friendship and brotherhood it is sacrifice commitment and respect for the objectives it is finally the growth of human relations If I think of the many young people who after finishing their school hours close in their bedrooms and immerse themselves in a virtual and digital world I regret with nostalgia the fields of the oratory and the skinned knees Sport is also involvement and sharing between generations The many small clubs and sports associations born and developed in this I love to call the country of the 8,000 bell towers live and thrive thanks to the fundamental contribution of many former athletes or non-athletes who make their operation possible I think of the mothers who make hot tea the fathers who act as collective drivers the grandparents who cut the grass of the field maybe the former champion who now takes care of the stock of the material Without them this would not be possible Without them these social micro universes these real extended families could not exist and flourish To them must be addressed our work and go our thought and our thanks If we understand this if we do what we can to protect this basic reality then we will appreciate even more the moments of success of high level sport Colleagues in less than four years our mountains will host an exceptional event the Winter Olympics Milan Cortina 2026 Let 's make them the visible tip of an iceberg but underneath the water 's hair there is solidity and concreteness For all these reasons I announce the strong vote in favour of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione"
Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President we have taken part in the drafting of the new Rules of Procedure as you have been able to verify even in the restricted Committee in a spirit that is absolutely available and constructive I would also like to thank Mr Malan for having been more assiduous than I have been in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy It is clear that when we are about to correct the rules governing the operation of a branch of Parliament there can only be an approach of maximum seriousness maximum correctness and maximum objectivity and not instrumentality Well this same spirit and attitude have only been grasped sporadically in the various speeches of my colleagues representing the majority In fact this is a regulation written by that majority that at the time when the Draghi Government was still alive and therefore the concept of majority and opposition was valid considered to write an organized regulation on contingency That is what we have objected to from the very beginning The rules of operation of the Senate of the Republic in our opinion cannot be written under the influence of an absolutely original circumstance such as the one that determined the course of the past legislature by virtue of which the Chambers were dissolved a few days ago as is known The original circumstances of the course of that legislature have for example determined the hypertrophic representation of the Mixed Group here as well as in the Chamber Those circumstances were particular and original I repeat do we want to say that they were motivated a little also from the result of 2018 Are we to say that this Parliament was from the outset placed under a shadow represented by the fact that a large part of its representatives were precisely members of the party that someone called run away from home not me but someone else Rules must be written to prevent this from happening again It does not seem useful for example to predict the economic damage to the workings of the Groups when there are changes from one Group to another when we know that the financial allocations of the Groups are obviously not benefits ad personam but they are resources necessary to ensure the functioning of the Groups even more so when about 30 of the Senators will fail with the implementation of the reform of the reduction in the number of Members On the contrary therefore the resources if anything at a time when the groups will have to cope with legislative and secretariat work for example and with the increased work required of senators and Members were to be increased Another circumstance that does not convince us at all as Senator Malan has explained perfectly in his statement and in the request for the secret vote is this bringing back to a political logic the functioning of the Council for the authorizations as we imagine it will give rise to many messes that will then reverberate as the colleague has rightly said not so much on the prerogatives of the senators and not on the so called privileges told with journalistic abbreviation by observers a little too inattentive but on prerogatives of the Senate to ensure an objective and objective operation In all these circumstances Mr President which we have also discussed extensively in the debate on the functioning of the Junta we shall abstain from voting on Rule 1 and then we shall see how we can vote on the subsequent articles
Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President in spite of the appearances this is a very important measure it concerns the reorganization and the new financing criteria of an important part of our health care of our National Health Service both that provided by public facilities and that in the case of IRCCS which is moreover the majority provided by private facilities In our country there are 51 institutions of hospitalization and scientific care 31 are so called private ones among which there are centres of excellence such as St. Raffaele the Child Jesus talking about individuals in this case is obviously a euphemism and 20 are public referring directly to the National Health Service We have examined this text carefully and to be honest Mr Sileri we were more concerned about it a few months ago when we read it and followed the work in the other branch of Parliament What happened reassures us in part since the delegation law will probably fall to the center right which will also be called to govern the fate of national health care So from this point of view we 're a little less concerned but of course we 're all begging But what is the point of this reasoning The basic idea of the establishment of these centres of assistance and research was the translation of knowledge between research and assistance it seems a banality but nobody tells us even today what is the result achieved after almost forty years by the law and after twenty years by the most substantial reform of 2003 What are the results and results of the copious resources addressed to these scientific institutions defined as IRCCS in terms of assistance and for example of impact factor for research How much have these institutions been enriched in terms of innovation baggage innovative networks and ability to adhere to care and care needs compared to the resources addressed This money my colleague Sileri has it been spent or invested This is the issue that is missing in the text One cannot but start from an analysis of what has happened over the last twenty thirty or forty years in order to act in terms of the reorganization of these institutions Moreover we know that everything fits as the President of our Commission has rightly pointed out in a framework of reordering of the PNRR mission 6 so in the big issue of reordering territorial assistance but also of the hospital so all this remains to be done I repeat that we would have been 100 concerned we care about 50 but it remains a incomplete text from this point of view Let me give you an example to understand and to clarify many of these IRCCS have peripheral locations which have obviously led to an area of spending centres Have they served Can we confirm them all I have some doubts about that I would like to understand what the budget for these years is One way of clarifying to Parliament what is happening with regard to this important piece of national health care would for example be a regular report detailing with anticipation what is happening because it is obvious that these institutions receive resources through the regions by contract private IRCCS by convention public IRCCS but they are still paid for in performance How were these performances It is a doubt that remains and will remain I fear for some more time Having said that the text as a whole is normal also thanks to the agendas on which it has been given a favourable opinion I would like to thank Mrs Binetti as rapporteur for the text for being always precise and precise as I have seen in our four years of attendance at the Commission We will therefore vote in favour because we have no particular reason to distinguish ourselves from the vote on this measure but with a final wish which echoes the controversy that Mr Parente rightly referred to We have a huge amount of money for health care through a thousand channels one of which is IRCCS If there is no detailed and precise logic of evaluating these expenses so that the investment content can be determined rather than spending then it is clear that the Regions are right a thousand times when they claim even today that they have not been reimbursed of the greater expenses incurred and documented according to the instructions received from the Ministry regarding the various waves of Covid This is very serious ladies and gentlemen because the regions have faced it with their own resources sometimes with important reserves there are some let us think of the larger ones which have allocated abundant reserves to the need to balance the higher Covid costs The State must intervene on these and cannot refer them to the Regions because they all go into disarray on this road This is a serious serious problem There is another serious problem ladies and gentlemen do you know that the National Health Fund is not yet allocated directed and agreed as the law provides The regions have not yet given the green light to the National Health Fund because they clearly and rightly call for greater attention for example to higher energy costs Think how much more a hospital can cost for a thousand beds and see that there are so many around Italy well here can not be worth the logic and the game of the cerino to who remains in the hand In the past few days we had started a cognitive survey with the Health and Health Commission and we first listened to the head of the Ministry of Economics and Finance assigned to the National Health Fund but there were no answers to this If up to now there has been a deficit of sensitivity denounced not later than today by President Fedriga towards the need to allocate resources having good attention to their concrete results and results of these resources also of IRCCS this is the theme that will engage the next majority the next Government and the next parliamentarians who will sit among these scranni and that will deal with health I would like to hope that this greater sensitivity will be widely shared beyond the sides and the game of the parties
Minister the subject of the question is the fourth dose of the vaccine It is as you know a controversial issue on which the scientific community 's discordant opinions insist among which it would seem that those who attribute to the fourth dose do not have any effect especially with regard to the latest Omicron and Omicron 2 variants Finally today with statements even quite clear Professor Caruso president of the Italian Society of Virology says that at this time making a fourth dose of anti-Covid 19 vaccine with drugs aged at least two years and aimed at countering a viral strain that is no longer present in the world is an absurd thing from the theoretical point of view Professor Caruso also wonders whether this is linked to a time of difficulty in the pharmaceutical industry that is not to provide us with a second generation vaccine or in a more bad way if we have to imagine that there are deposits to empty Minister it is legitimate to suspect that there are deposits to be emptied since a few minutes ago I extracted from the European Commission 's website confirmation of the fact that 4.2 billion doses of vaccine have been purchased from a European population that does not reach half a billion people There are approximately 10 doses of vaccine of the old vaccine of course per head which you do not understand well what they should be used for Today an important newspaper Il Fatto writes that the fourth dose is used to dispose of Pfizer 's stocks Beyond what may be the controversial world of the scientific community and I do not envy it Minister in having to interpret absolutely conflicting messages it must be said that this branch of Parliament approved an agenda in the Government 's favour on 7 January which called for the need to carry out an antibody screening before proceeding to the fourth dose then the second booster dose in order to assess whether the person to whom it is inoculated already has an antibody immunizing heritage If this general and overall screening had difficulties especially in terms of time and costs it would be absolutely important Minister to revise the strategy ensuring at least that this individual analysis is carried out at the request of the subject especially for those categories which should be subjected to vaccination obligation PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Health Mr Hope has the right to reply to the question which has just been put for three minutes
Mr President Minister we do not have much confidence in what Europe will be able to decide and in my modest role I also have little confidence in what can come out of the CTS given what has happened over the last two years However I would like to point out that there are two roads there are no more either we choose to allow the virus to circulate freely since it is suspected from several quarters that it has become endemic as I think we are doing since the number of swabs has fallen and we have left the barriers of entry or the other way is to continue to vaccinate the population in order to hinder the emergence of the virus in the organism However we must do so with second generation vaccines which for example guarantee a pulmonary cell memory as is urged on the most part The old vaccine is absolutely useless the second dose had a much shorter duration than the first the third booster had one of seven to ten weeks in viral coverage and the fourth would be even less immunizing Mr Minister let us carry out the study and urge the development of our vaccine that of the Higher Institute of Health which acts on protein N as you know we have talked about it and we have also tried an agenda in this regard I had an interview with Dr. Brusaferro from whom I did n't get all this enthusiasm It is necessary Minister to increase awareness and greater protagonism on your part During this last period of virus management probably in limine mortis of the pandemic Minister you will be able to rediscover some hope
Mr President I would like to join Mr Cantù in his remarks on the shameful circumstance that we have not been able to recognise the minimum compensation to the families of doctors and medical staff in general who have lost their lives because of the disorganization misinformation and the lack of sufficient mechanisms to protect them in the first and second waves of this epidemic I do so after I have shared the measure in the Commission and on all subsequent occasions when I have tried to convince the Government to do something absolutely normal indispensable dignified I also have to agree with Mr Airola and the others do n't want me In fact listening to the debate the opposition in this Chamber I address the Undersecretary representing the Government really goes far beyond the Brothers of Italy The verbal oral opposition has a remarkable consistency in this House and I could mention the Members who spoke before me the problem is that when you press the button you have to be careful to exchange green with red in short you exchange the vote in favour of the government with the contrary Without uncomfortableing a great Sicilian like Sciascia these people he would have called it quaquaraquà placing them at the top level in the ranking of the men of that great man who was Sciascia I therefore agree with my colleague Mr Airola because in fact Brothers of Italy is the only opposition party that then votes in line with what he says That 's true There are also others who make verbal opposition and then align themselves with what the Government establishes The decree law in conversion bears the norms that have concerned the last Christmas holidays at the end of the year and the epiphany because this Government is attentive to the sanctification of the holidays and has given us a decree law for each holiday the measures today in conversion only those of Christmas and St. Silvestro I do not want the representative of the Government of course there is nothing personal indeed on a personal level I express total solidarity because to those who work at the Ministry of Health with Minister Hope and come here to take all the right considerations heard so far there is only to express human consideration we would miss it Personally I would n't do that However there is a problem of coherence and almost dignity of decency of the institutions of the Senate of the Republic and of Parliament in general Colleagues today we are again dealing with measures that act on the side of the restrictions and we are going to convert them in the presence of a reality of the epidemic that sees us absolutely succumbed It is not a verbal exaggeration to say that you continue to enact and convert mortal measures This is a government that has exercised a deadly action compared to the pandemic and is not an exaggeration because in all the passages of the pandemic from the beginning Italy has recorded and continues to record the record of deaths today This evidence is dramatic because we are not talking about budget liabilities numbers but about hundreds of thousands of deaths and their family members With regard to this the entire Government the Minister of Health the infamous technical and scientific committee CTS the gentlemen who sit in that assembly who still speak still pontificate and are not ashamed to do so We are faced with a dramatically important circumstance we have brought our economy to its knees with dramatic results on our gross domestic product we have prevented the exercise of fundamental freedoms we have also prevented freedom of speech and a calm and normal confrontation on essential issues obtaining as a result the record of the dead still today And even today we go on television and come to Parliament to tell us that we must continue to do the same things we have done to date which have been mortifying And of all this we are not ashamed not even in front of ourselves in front of the mirror in front of our conscience Representative of the Government the things to start doing because others also do obtaining excellent results are to make mechanical ventilation in the classrooms which costs four pounds and must be done immediately to strengthen the transports to avoid the assembly of the boys who do not protect themselves with the masks because they are boys inside the buses of the school transport to develop the home therapies because that is why we have the record of the deaths People who are not treated at home in fact arrive in dramatic conditions in the hospital and die Vaccines must also be updated Mr. Undersecretary why do we continue to vaccinate with the vaccine that protects from the first version of the virus when the virus has completely changed We Mr Undersecretary do not do the tracking and not doing the tracking means completely losing control of the pandemic That is why among others we have the record of deaths We do n't even make sequencing that is we do n't know today if a positive person at Covid because he made a buffer rapid or molecular that is has an Omicron or Delta variant or a new variant because it is possible that there are new variants We do not sequence and be careful that is not what Senator Zaffini says in this Chamber today but he said it six months ago Brusaferro the head of the Higher Health Institute he said that Italy sequenced little We never moved on this pandemic doctors of general medicine who lived the pandemic in absentia Even today the doctors of general medicine are not involved and unfortunately there are many that tell nonsense We do n't do antibody screening which other countries do Before we proceed to other doses and become addicted to the vaccine we have to evaluate the antibodies because if someone had the Covid once or maybe two there are people who had the Covid even three times what is the use of vaccination What good is it when it is written on all sides that the antibodies that derive from the disease are evidently well superior better performing and immunizing vaccine antibodies otherwise old vaccine Why did we buy ten doses of vaccine each in Europe Can the government tell us that Why did we buy ten doses of the old vaccine And why do we continue to administer the old vaccine Is it legitimate to suspect that we simply have to run out of stocks Is it legitimate to suspect that I could talk for another half hour and say the things Italians ask themselves every day Mr President thank you for the time you have given me while the microphone flashes here Colleagues I conclude with a prayer to all of us we are aware of our role exercising at least the sacred obligation to ask questions and ask answers
Mr President we are responsible for ensuring a minimum of decency for the debate that follows these measures which come from the government in a difficult way to dedicate For the umpteenth time we come to examine in this House a very important measure which affects the daily life of Italians in a strict way and which affects not only their attitudes but also their daily life and even their eating And then we 'll clarify why I 'm saying this We will get there again without the rapporteur and we will see what will happen with regard to the possibility of discussing the amendments in this House This morning in the Commission of course because of the overlapping of timetables and timetables it was not possible to deal with the amendments nor did we end the examination of Article 1 All this in short is really becoming a reckless practice and I must say that fortunately there is the Brothers of Italy Group that as this morning and as on other occasions I would like to say as always since the Government has installed itself guarantees Parliament at least a minimum of decorum We are also doing so under these conditions knowing that we are speaking for the benefit of the shorthand report We do so regardless of any other consideration because obviously we have clear what our role and responsibility are and we respond as always to the Italians There are as I said many passages and a thousand inconsistencies in this provision Many passages by the way are anachronistic In fact we are converting and confirming outdated deadlines in this measure there are 28 February deadlines that we are converting today on 2 March and we are doing so obviously for the benefit of what has happened In a normal condition a normal government should instead have changed these measures and made them compatible with the conversion of the Assembly which has always been done and which clearly no longer finds room in the attitudes and postures to use a term that I heard yesterday of this government posing as ras There are four points I intend to deal with in particular because it would take an hour to deal with everything contained in the measure Among these four the most important in my opinion is the recognition of the food part of the salary We have also talked about this in the Commission because at least we have been able to exchange ideas on this We are failing to recognize the unbearable food component of the salary of those who are suspended from work because they have not been vaccinated while to give an example this food part of the salary is recognized to the mobsters the murderers or all those who civil servants are suspended from the service waiting for the process that sees them accused for serious crimes even hateful But those who are suspended from work and salary because they have not been vaccinated are not given the feeding portion of the salary That 's the way it is President It 's not recognized There are people who do n't get to be able to guarantee their family food spending I think I see the disbelief in the eyes of my fellow Members who listen few in fact but I assure you that this happens there are also amendments from the political side of the President who have tried to make it clear to the Government that this can not be continued There is another subject which is also paradoxical we are going as far as possible as we said yesterday and repeated it to welcome the refugees of this wretched war within Europe and at the gates of national borders Well many of these subjects are vaccinated with Sputnik did you make this trivial consideration Do you realize that this is a vaccine that has the same technology and the same results of effect and validity as the vaccines that we have inoculated in Italy such as Pfizer and Moderna i.e. mRNA vaccines And yet we do n't recognize who received the Sputnik vaccine as covering the green pass So what are we gonna do with these people Do we revenge them again or leave them without green passes with everything that 's involved What will happen to these people who come from that territory of war and oppression I have another subject for the benefit of the House and there are amendments dealing with these matters We launched the Novavax vaccine a protein vaccine presented as the green vaccine the vaccine of all those who had not vaccinated so far because they did not trust or rely on what we had told them about the validity of vaccines until now used Well the Novavax vaccine is a failure in the sense that all regions have made it available but there is no access to this vaccine and it is now widely registered It is therefore true ladies and gentlemen that what has to be done from the outset we are still not doing so today we still think that we want to force people to vaccinate rather than convince them And how is it possible to convince people to vaccinate Mr Sileri It is possible through doctors of general medicine Recently we held a hearing in the Commission with the trade union representatives of family doctors who said that no region has made available to doctors the records of their caregivers who are not covered by the vaccine there was no feedback there was no collaboration there was no involvement of the main figure to which the citizen has to rely To whom should the citizen be entrusted The Gruber and the 8 and a half To whom should the citizen be entrusted but to his family doctor Well family doctors have always been constantly also in this circumstance related to the Novax vaccine excluded from any operation of conviction and involvement of citizens still not vaccinated Mr President it has been nine minutes and twenty five seconds PRESIDENT The debate is closed You 've got ten minutes and I 'm warning you 35 seconds away Do n't you trust the bell Mr Zaffini FdI I still have 40 seconds Finally I would like to conclude Mr President I do not think there will be any particular traffic in this morning 's speeches PRESIDENT The debate is closed I 'll give you another minute Come to the conclusion Mr Zaffini FdI Let 's move on to the ventilation of the classrooms Even today after two years of pandemic and these particularly cold days in Rome we are venting the classrooms of the schools where we send our children through the opening of the windows If this is acceptable in a civilized and modern country I let you consider it We have adopted amendments concerning the possibility of adapting classrooms with forced mechanical ventilation in school environments but these measures are not reflected in the circulars and regulations that the government must implement it must do so today immediately not in three or six months time But all this is not there and on the other hand brought to the stage of conversion and approval of the Senate Assembly and in the two branches of Parliament measures expired on 28 February I believe Mr President that this must be stopped That 's what the President of the Republic said The poor country senator does n't say that but the President of the Republic said so We have to cut it down and if the Senate presidency does not do so we have to see that the Government does not have such attention who should do so I ask myself and ask you who should do it Who is it that must call everyone to a sense of responsibility in accordance with their role and to exercise their prerogatives to the full as the constitutional path requires and no later We are going farther Mr President It 's time to get this over with
Mr President you appreciate the circumstances as Mr Parrini has just said would like to do the same In other words we would like to say basically do as you wish if it were not that we will find ourselves in a few minutes to the fortieth vote of confidence of this truly hypertrophic majority if it were not that the Brothers of Italy is the only party to support the general debate in the Chamber on a measure that becomes important because of the measures it contains and which concern a thousand aspects from health to others which are relevant to important passages in the daily life of our nation if it were not that today we are going directly to discuss with the same style and the same technique that I have seen adopted since I sit on this scranno and that in the inauguration speech of the President of the Republic it has been pointed out as a practice to abandon not to follow and not to repeat We did not vote to elect that President of the Republic but from the next minute we recognized him of course as our President the President of all the President of our Republic You have sanctified him sanctified him beatified him in all your speeches in the Chamber on that occasion as in the other successive ones the last time was just yesterday or the day before yesterday and on that occasion I heard a reference to his high statements I personally share them but in the attitudes you continue to operate in the same way An important measure like the one we are considering today would have deserved in every passage a deepening in the competent Commissions because there would have been time and certainly there would have been also the will on our part as opposition party to do as we never do non-sterile opposition but precise and punctual on the topics and topics Well today instead you increase even the weight of your superficiality of your worrying expedition leaving the entire burden of the general discussion on this provision to the two interventions registered by the party to which I belong Brothers of Italy All this moves me Mr President not to deal with the issues dealt with by the measure because it is an absolutely useless and school based exercise In my speech however I appeal to the institutions which I know are present in so many Members in each of you to ensure that this really does not happen again and that you do not continue to adopt such an attitude in all the measures that you are going to take in this short legislative period which really risks becoming a sort of cross-roads based on this type of attitude Today we are in the presence of numerous emergencies among which paradoxically health care seems to be the least worrying We have a geopolitical emergency that our leaders have dealt with so far We are facing a dramatic economic crisis I believe and hope that Parliament in a whirlwind of dignity my colleague Mr D'Incà will at least be able to regain its rightful role in these circumstances and that the President of the Republic has also recalled in his speech of inauguration
"Mr President the work of the opposition with this Government is very easy to do It would suffice to comment on the measure in question with two paradigms with two methods of judgment one is that this is the forty fourth vote of confidence to which the present Government forces Parliament I can speak with reasonable constriction Mr President Beyond the point we all know of the appeal of the President of the Republic who has redone his predecessor with respect to the repeated and excessive use of confidence voting there is another aspect I am speaking to you exactly Mr President as a pro-tempore representative of that group to say that the other aspect is the most total disinterest in dealing with the measure by colleagues It is obvious and natural that after 44 votes of confidence the MEP should stop appealing to the sense of responsibility to the desire to work and to apply to the study and preparation of measures to the support of the debate first in the Commission and then in this House It stops doing its job and this is for everyone of course particularly those who are Members of Parliament to safeguard the role and decency of the institutions The second subject would suffice only to mention it my colleagues Mr Calandrini and Mr De Bertoldi were very clear but so were those of the other groups who like Senator Toffanin spoke on the affair of the 110 superbonus which is commented on by themselves You do damage and are cursedly harmful in the context of the current social political and economic situation of the country as you like to call it but I call it Italy Nation It is really difficult to pinpoint the kind of attitude of a government that intervening on a measure penalizes a sector that had shown timid signs of recovery On all the bonus measures that were to be hit the one on 110 was the last to be dealt with indeed the only one not to be dealt with because if there are evasion scam and deception this happens on other bonuses which instead leave unchanged You guys play a little spill I wonder if the representative of the government knows the game of the reverse a variant of the tressette You 're gonna play trash Take measures that are contrary to normal common sense In the face of a debate that has already been conditioned and heavily cut by the vote of confidence and the mistrust of colleagues in relation to what is happening in this House the representative of the Government does not even take note because his presence here is useless He 's here for duty of presence for a duty related to the shorthand report and I speak for the same duty This government compared to what suggests the least parliamentary debate that survives and I stress the adjective understands little late and badly It would be better if he did not understand at all what we suggest to him in the various measures with amendments observations and agendas according to the normal activity of a democracy with the institutions that work He understands late and badly he realizes the existence of the problem certifies it to us in the measures and then adopts a solution or better thinks to give us one which is just light years away from being such It 's worse It 's like when at school interviews teachers said to my mother it 's nothing but it 's worse because she would also be able to do That 's the theme You are worse than the schoolboy who unfortunately does n't do anything but would be smart and also capable of doing Let me give an example by referring to the resources provided to the Regions for the Covid with a measure that you define as final as to say I give you these four points and do not ask me anymore You pay an additional 400 million on a title for which only Umbria my Region which with its 900,000 inhabitants has a relative weight must take 110 million but attention already reduced and discounted It is not that because of Covid in addition to the regional health fund he has spent 110 he has spent many more about 300 million more and has to recover 110 You put 400 for all the Italian regions The Emilia Romagna of my colleague Errani who looks at me must take 700 Then I wonder representative of the Ministry of Economics and Finance but who has to put this money there Who Who 's gonna put this money in there It is money spent by the Regions not promised it is spent already reported If you 're smarter you 're smarter but you have to check you 're a member of this Those who are smarter who are less clever are still money reported How do you say you put 400 million on a permanent basis How final Then the regions go into disarray They have to go into disarray You are announcing that all the regions of Italy will be in disarray We are talking in fact about the definitive title and not that as for all the other things that you come to tell us you will put back our hands with the next provision as you have always done It is not that we were told not to worry because we are aware of the problem which will be discussed at the next step No President this time it is written definitively There 's no cat tripe left Where does this arrogance in institutional relations come from Where is the sound and correct cooperation between the institutions and the institutions Where is he And why are you so sure that you can speak in this wretched country permanently There 's nothing here definitive There is only your inability and your inconsistency without any extenuating Mr President I would like to speak for another half an hour because I have taken so many notes on a measure which you of the hypertrophic majority consider insignificant I only set the example of the Regions Recognize that you must compensate for the adverse events from vaccines for those who are vaccinated out of the obligation which assuming a health treatment is therefore already compensated for perhaps So put money to compensate for adverse events from vaccines Well do you know how much you give for the adverse event against the family members of a deceased Although the total numbers are all to be seen remember that in Italy we recorded over 150,000 deaths Do you know how much you give with the measure to our examination to the relatives of a deceased one off 77,000 euros Shame shame shame As far as the family of professionals is concerned I can only endorse what Mrs Cantù said We are still dragging the fact that we recognize fair compensation to the relatives of health care workers who have died because of the State who did not provide personal protective equipment DPI forcing them to work under massacred conditions let 's say because of the epidemic if we want the general attenuating We are still fighting over the compensations of the deceased health workers due to the first and second wave of the Covid If I said shame three times before I should say it five this time but I do n't I save time You have decided to finance the student masks without making it clear that it is the State that has to provide them You funded them I recall that an agenda of Brothers of Italy has passed Everything that is in fact written in the provision at our examination President had been dealt with by Brothers of Italy 's amendments to the budget law and to the various previous measures Copy and evil because you are not capable The FFP2 masks must provide them it is not enough to allocate the money and look at the need for masks for children aged five to sixteen because normal FFP2s are not good for their faces we have dealt with this issue in the Commission and in the Chamber and we have approved an agenda of Brothers of Italy with a favourable opinion of the Government but we do not see the way and we do not understand what must happen I shall close my speech Mr President and I thank you for your time with an amendment which has been adopted After a full intervention of complaints and crampons it is also right that it closes with a movement of hope at least one which derives from an amendment approved proposed by the undersigned and by Brothers of Italy which provides a certain amount at the start for families and subjects forced to use technical medical sanitary equipment the so called devices which absorb energy and therefore have great costs in the household bill Well this amendment has been adopted and we are largely satisfied with it So I want to end with a message of hope and trust but that to be fair is even worse because it means that sometimes when you understand the serious proposals you also know how to deal with them Then always do so because through parliamentary activity the normal one not this the measures can only be improved and Italy can only go better if the institutions work"
"Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President this is the first time in this parliamentary term that I have asked you to speak on matters not included on the agenda because I am forced to ask through this medium for an answer to a question that I had first signed which we presented to the Government last February on a relevant circumstance such as the deaths from Covid This is an issue on which a Commission of Inquiry should have been committed if they had allowed us to set it up because all the European Parliaments have made available to their citizens parliamentary committees of inquiry that shed light on the many aspects of the pandemic and the emergency that has come about but not Italy There are regions that have set up committees of inquiry in Italy but Parliament does not because there is an emergency this is the reason why a parliamentary committee of inquiry cannot be set up Well the citizens will judge about it One of the first issues that a hypothetical Commission of Inquiry should have faced is the excess of mortality in our country compared to the European panorama our deaths for Covid are the most numerous On the other hand Mr President our measures to contain freedoms with the consequent economic deaths are the ones that have killed the national economy the most because our GDP is the one that has suffered the greatest reduction On these two figures President we have questioned Minister Hope and we would like to have an answer since it is precisely on the Republic that an article has been published that quotes a report by The Lancet which compared to health issues is a sort of Gospel based on a world study that punctually analyzes the deaths for Covid from all over the world and notes that in Italy compared to those registered that are over 160,000 there would be 120,000 more I do n't know what the truth is I do n't even want to imagine it but I want our Minister of Health to tell me by responding to the inspection union act 3-03124 presented at session 407 of 23 February 2022"
Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President the Brothers of Italy Group will vote in favour of this measure when we examine it Sometimes it happens that colleagues put forward the vote in favour for example by adding convincingly We can say that we will vote for the measure serenely in the sense that although it represents the first step of a path certainly necessary and indeed absolutely essential we do not consider it an exhaustive measure or in any case able to counter the problem of corruption in health transactions in itself Money inside health care is a lot a lot On average the regions allocate between 70 and 80 of their budget to health Having passed on health or a large part of the health sector to them was certainly a positive measure because it differentiated the risk and divided it Leaving the enormous mass of money in health care to a single subject evidently as the history of the first Republic taught us was a huge problem by dividing it on all the regions we at least divided the mountain at risk of corruption of capital destined for health In order to give colleagues an idea of what we are talking about I would like to point out that in 2020 the data on corruption reported by the main national newspapers showed the health sector in second place That is to say that about 17.33 percent of the corruption reported by the Italian media occurred in the health sector This is about 117 cases It is evident that the figure is approximated by default as it is the cases of corruption that have come to know and thus discovered Compared to this figure it is the submerged one that worries us Corruption in health care is as widespread as it is more dangerous because it harms the citizen as well as the state 's coffers It damages it by leading to poor treatment endless waiting lists doctors who use devices chosen not for their quality but for the profit they can make more or less legitimately more or less transparently We also think of the welfare paths even influenced by the possible economic gain Colleagues it is useless to deny that the public dimension of health certainly does not protect you for example from the incursions of big pharmas or in any case suppliers of drugs devices computer aids and programs A whole world that clings to the national health system and draws life from it The Covid did not simplify the theme indeed if possible it got worse because it increased the lifeblood and the destinations of money to health care widening the field to possible incursions and corruptions A group of researchers committed to facilitating access to data to improve transparency in health care estimated that in the three years 2017 2019 the funding allocated in a transparent way by the main pharmaceutical companies amounted to about one billion euros all this in the form of donations refreshment of travel expenses compensation for advice organization of events hospital garrisons and research centers This enormous amount of money I repeat is transparent and is also clearly inferior to reality as it is certainly approximated by default gives the idea of how much it is necessary to make as transparent as possible what happens in the relationships involving financial disbursements in health care The text of the measure before us which has some shadows but which is generally in favour of us so much so that we as I said will peacefully vote for its approval given certain rules of knowledge assuming that what is transparent is in itself legitimate All right since we have done so in many other areas such as for example with political foundations with banking relations with the famous transparency in financial transactions Precisely because there are these precedents we have seen however that the mere fact of the knowledge and publication on a website or on a Facebook page of transactions that pertain to financial movements in health care does not in itself lead to a solution What we are doing with this measure is an important first step There was a gap and it was appropriate to fill it but now it is clear that further system reforms are needed because unfortunately there is no other way to force operators in the sector to have a substantial not by chance correct use of this adjective The only way that we are given is to eliminate the laces and laces so defined by someone before me of the rules of the market that is making the transactions available to everyone as much as possible therefore widening the lists of the suppliers with thousand other possible measures leaving to the market the possibility to self regulate on the basis of the famous law of the supply and demand that in the end in my opinion is the only real form to guarantee transparency It is clear that by participating in a system of transparent competitions and supplies the more the audience of the actors widens the more the same control each other I repeat with this bill we do not solve the problem We have done well to deal with it and we have been absolutely in agreement and in favour but much and much more clearly there is to be done Think of everything that has happened with vaccines think of how much we are puzzled and forbidden the story of the famous ten vaccines purchased for every European citizen according to what has been published on the European Union website even if at the direct request of the official in charge of these transactions I have not received an answer Think about what 's still to be done With this measure we have dealt with a little bit of the problem but it must obviously be further developed it must be expanded a culture that basically says that the money it serves for public health is doubly valuable and that those who take it fraudulently and illegitimately commit a double and triple crime compared to a general rule that makes or should render this money truly sacred and untouchable
Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President today is an important occasion the fiftieth vote of confidence that the Italian Parliament is holding with this Executive The government of the best or supposedly such that in reality is the Government of the Renitent at least to the parliamentary debate proposes to us the fiftieth vote of confidence on an absolutely important and substantial subject what is the one that faces the so called decree law reopenings We have always in the course of the pandemic for countless times put our attention to the need to review health standards and to put an end to restrictive measures Years have passed since the beginning of the pandemic but the posture as President Draghi would say is always the same This measure continues to provide restrictive measures and neglects important health measures that are now absolutely obvious to everyone except the Government With regard to restrictive measures for example Article 1 it is even expected that civil protection orders may be issued again until 31 December at the reasoned request of the competent administrative authorities communicated to the Chambers and therefore without the knowledge of the institutions This is really serious and paradoxical because it is now clear that we have full ears of these measures Another argument is the one correctly illustrated with narrow teeth my colleague Romeo I regret it and I hope that his teeth will not suffer even if continuing to have to do interventions with tight teeth puts the structure of his teeth at risk compared to the blessed masks If in fact Mr President of the 12th The Commission the head of the Ministry 's prevention says that it has no scientific evidence capable of supporting the need for the use of masks then the answer to my colleague Romeo I do it it is clear that we want to continue with the media gag and also the symbolic gag because the world moves on symbols and the mask begins to become a symbol There are still restrictive measures to the detriment of health care which you know now ladies and gentlemen these are the ones we have repeated a thousand times namely home therapies territorial health and the Covid protocol for hospitals as well Even today there is no specific Covid protocol for hospital admissions and I do not say for home therapies where still exists the famous Tachipirina protocol and vigilant expectation We need the new vaccine My colleague Mr Sileri I appreciate your presence and your constancy and I also hope that your teeth will remain but I think it has become paradoxical that even in the scientific community everyone wonders about the need for a new vaccine and the inopportunity to call to the fourth dose since in October we will probably be forced to call to the fifth dose with the new vaccine I hope that the new vaccine will take account of the variations Someone should also explain to us poor Members of Parliament to the knowledge of which the measures continue to be adopted what the ten vaccines per head that Europe has bought from the large producers who make exorbitant budgets have been used for Monitoring and prophylaxis capacity should be increased Compared to this point the opinion of the 12th The Commission has a note which I appreciated although it is obviously not enough to get us to vote on that opinion Measures on school should be taken Rather than forcing the kids to gag fortunately at least over six years for hours and hours with absolutely minimal expense compared to what you have made for the many investments in the school I can think of one that I leave to you to guess because I do n't want to persevere and continue to talk about the usual affair of wheelchairs you should provide for the mechanical ventilation of the classrooms as the virus in September and October will recover along with that flu Ventilation has been shown to reduce 80 of the transmissibility which the vaccine cannot guarantee In fact the vaccine has been able to guarantee fewer admissions to intensive care and deaths probably even if we talk about this but it has not covered compared to the communicability of the virus Providing ventilation of classrooms which are still chicken classes would be absolutely important to reduce the transmissibility by more than 80 as has been shown What is the record of the reopenings I have heard the speeches of my fellow Members and today we are ready to take stock of the dramatic period that Italy has gone through Well budgets are soon made my colleague Mr Sileri we have 20 million health benefits suspended a huge amount of healthcare denied one in three Italians has been waiting for a health benefit and has probably been waiting for it for months if not for years The regions are exhausted Colleagues do you know how much the deficit of the Regions compared to the Covid expenditures anticipated by them with their own budgets We are talking about 8.5 billion euros so much the amount advanced by the Regions compared to Covid expenses only in a small part reimbursed by the State Covid funding amounts to about 5 billion in total over the two years the expenditure of the Regions amounts to more than 13 billion in the same period of time Lombardy for example spent 1.7 billion and 1.077 billion in 2022 in 2021 Lazio spent 870 million in 2021 and 840 million in 2022 which are 80 expenditure on the regional budget Do you understand what it means with respect to suspended benefits and waiting lists if the Regions are exhausted from the financial point of view because the state has done ATMs with regional budgets and does not commit to return the anticipated expenses with the Covid What awaits us is dramatic compared to this picture The most dramatic budget of this period however ladies and gentlemen and I would like to say to my colleague Mr Boldrini that the direction of the road is absolutely not this that the government has seen after the whole pandemic period is the greatest reduction in gross domestic product compared to the Western economies as a result of the restrictive measures taken which also prevent the recovery of pre-Covid levels Today Il Sole 24 Ore headlines Italy at the last place for the recovery of pre-Covid levels of GDP But above all truly dramatic it is that we still record the greatest number of deaths today compared to the Covid epidemic On this you can discern what you want you can say everything and more but all the magazines and the scientific community accredit Italy to the top of the rankings for deaths from Covid Stop then saying that the direction of march is the right one because if this is the direction of march obviously take Italy to beat I shall conclude Mr President Thank you very much and I would like to address my colleagues in the majority including the rapporteurs why has Italy remained the last European nation not to set up a Commission of Inquiry For what reason What are you afraid of Italy has had committees of inquiry in all the legislatures except this and the previous one why do you not want to set up a church commission that goes to see what happened in our national health system with the emergency Covid You 'll have to tell us and you 'll have to explain it especially to the Italians
Senator Zaffini may I remind you possibly to hold within five minutes Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President it would be ten minutes but I will speak very quickly Brothers of Italy of course will vote against this measure for a series of circumstances that adhere to the method which we can easily synthesize by the fact that if you are not capable because you are demonstrating that you are no longer capable then put the thirty sixth or thirty seventh trust At least you do n't take us hostage in this House for your inability As far as the substance is concerned we must unfortunately note that there is still pressure on coercive measures and on the contrary health containment measures are not being taken I do not explain them but for example my colleague Mr Sileri they are forced ventilation in school classrooms the strengthening of transport home therapies the updating of vaccines because even the WHO has said that with old vaccines it is useless to continue to vaccinate tracking which we have completely lost and sequencing even more important that we are not doing enough We have not been able to involve doctors of general medicine yet on the need to get to vaccinate the six million Italians who have not yet vaccinated themselves We should carefully consider the case of antibody screening I recall that Switzerland has adopted this methodology to even issue a document such as the green pass With regard to all these failures it is quite clear that we cannot continue to exercise coercion of individual freedoms and freedoms of enterprise This is not a general reminder of not being able to take the necessary health measures I 'll finish with a joke We were busy for a day an afternoon and a night to convert a decree dead law because every provision was exceeded by the three successive decrees I repeat we have started 2022 in a tragic way with regard to the progress of parliamentary work I appeal to the Presidency not to repeat what is happening and what has happened today
Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President with the measure under consideration Parliament the Government and the State are doing a sort of due act that is they are actually celebrating a technical mechanical occasion so to speak the anniversary of the eight centuries since the death of Francesco d'Assisi which took place on 3 October 1226 Mr President I imagine however that in the idea of all of us this celebration comes out on the exquisitely celebrative side to embrace what we actually celebrate namely a system of values that over time the figure of Francis represented and materialized All this in a city in a territory in a region and in a nation such as Italy of which Francis is patron evidently unanimously recognized who live this reality and try to transfer it and pass it on I come from Umbria and have lived for a few years in Assisi colleagues I can testify to you that in fact in those places you can breathe what John Paul II called the spirit of Assisi now it is really complicated to describe how to act in order to succeed in materializing it in the use of the resources made available The objective is to find a link even at a celebratory moment between a due act which we obviously approve and appreciate and advance that we will vote in favour achieved by the Government and the State with respect to the need to make available organizational and economic and financial structures to celebrate worthily over several years the very important anniversary and a system of values that more than ever before is absolutely indispensable to absorb transfer pass on and receive fully in everyday life in the government of the States and the destinies of the communities that are recognized in the States for example today of Europe it is a truly difficult and difficult undertaking which remains at the head of this committee on which we recommend and ask for the utmost attention Mr President because it will have the difficult task of leaving an empty celebration of the eight centuries of recurrence from the death of the saint in order to enter instead into a logic of preservation and transfer of indispensable values in this historical moment more than ever more than ever It is not obvious that this will happen colleagues Not because of controversy I remember and I quote a passage here is my colleague Modena who lived as protagonist that season when I was regional councillor of the Umbria Region we wrote a re-edition of the regional statute which is a sort of constitution of the regional community of Umbria I repeat that I remember it not because of polemic vis but only to help understand the difficulty of transferring these values in an absolutely shared way well we failed to indicate in article 1 of the status of the Region those represented by Francis and Benedict as founding values of the regional community of Umbria We could n't We were in opposition and the majority of the time identified Capitini as the one who embodied the values of peace that the city of Assisi but also the whole regional community obviously share in an absolutely widespread way Well I repeat that I do not say this because of controversy today the new statute of Umbria in the elaboration phase will contain that quote I believe that this is absolutely necessary and indispensable because symbols rhetorical figures images stories and traditions must be quoted handed down known and represented to the younger generations to those who come after If the figure of Francis and the values he represented which have exploded in their importance over the centuries today rise to this importance it is precisely because we must be able to transfer them into the shared absolutely outside the dynamics of partisan political discussions I hope that all of this will succeed in doing so in this committee to which an organizational programme a system of events and the need to take decisions and measures using resources which as far as I am concerned seem appropriate and which will be useful for taking action on these sides You know colleagues to give you a figure where the word Italy appears for the first time in Italian art In the upper basilica of Assisi in the frescoes of Cimabue Giotto Simone Martini and Cimabue pass these values in a visual and plastic way in the same way I believe that with different instruments and with different logics this committee should do so to which we will obviously pay great attention in controlling what happens and in directing its activity The Government 's recommendation to provide a great deal of attention to its formation avoiding that it can represent a simple means of sharing tasks however unpaid even if important and making it an opportunity instead to contribute in a widely shared way to the formulation of a program of events that can give meaning to the recurrence Good job
Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President it is important this evening to highlight an unpleasant situation in Umbria on Sunday Nothing serious nothing dramatic but Minister Hope came to Umbria and rather than coming to announce the acceptance of important projects presented by the Region in the framework of the measures envisaged by the PNRR right in the city of Assisi where the Minister thought to entertain for a private occasion went then to the Municipality and together with the mayor of that city obviously more related to its political part he entertained on the need to keep alive the hospital of Assisi which evidently is already at the attention of the Region However the Minister decides either the measures are taken according to the schemes and grids drawn up by the Ministry the National Agency for Regional Health Services Agenas the technicians and the PNRR scheme for the permanence of the territorial hospital structures or the Minister takes autonomous measures it is not well known which ones to ensure the existence or not of a hospital Evidently this is a matter of exclusive competence of the Region it is a competing matter but in this case it is exclusively of the Region moreover in Umbria the regional health plan is being drawn up therefore the interference of the Minister is used indeed exploited by the mayor of the city of Assisi obviously of the PD who illustrates the problems concerning the hospital and the Minister gives guarantee about their resolution In that same city there is a project presented by the Umbria Region that concerns the disabled of the Seraphic Institute of Assisi which needs the realization of a health structure provided for by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan the Minister should therefore come and tell us what will be of that project rather than ingesting in a path of formation of the regional health plan in which however the hospital of Assisi will have its importance and its relevance consistent with the grids parameters and rules established at national level by the Ministry of Health
Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President I am actually announcing the vote of abstention by Brothers of Italy It is not so much a recognition of the substance of the method of the work done by the rapporteurs by Mr La Pietra and of the work done in the Commission This should be the rule it should be what we always do the measure comes from the government as always it makes water from all sides because this is a government of people too different that they do not agree even if they take coffee or decaf so there are measures bag- of bone as we would say in journalistic jargon and Parliament with its amending activity does its job that is improves the text and comes out a better measure That would be the rule but as we unfortunately know it has been quite straightforward with repeated votes in which the question of trust has been raised In fact I would like to point out that there are very rare acts on which you can work Compared to this and also in part to the contents that have emerged the decision of the Brothers of Italy Group is to abstain on this measure It is clear that in relation to this we cannot fail to highlight the enormous shortcomings of this measure first of all the data of resources In politics weighing the importance of a measure takes place by assessing the resources that are allocated to it In this regard the resources that the amending activity has managed to increase added to the resources provided by the Government are really minimal and they allow easy to understand the degree of attention of the Government to the problem that as has been observed by all is enormous and weighs on the domestic product that from some parts has been evaluated between direct and indirect i.e. extended product near the three points of GDP This is an absolutely serious thing because if the quality leap of this virus were to happen and pass to the domestic pig I remember and it has already been said that it is a very dangerous virus because it survives in the carcasses and does not have a vaccine for us it would really be a very serious debâcle The second limit of the measure that comes out of this branch of Parliament is the time factor We all know that the time factor is obvious compared to immediate measures to combat the spread I do not say eradication which will be more difficult and is beyond to come Compared to the detection of the presence of the virus in the first carcass months have passed and this is very serious Mr La Pietra said this the problem does not concern the working time I say to the rapporteur of the measure in Parliament those were appropriate useful and I repeat we are appreciating the method and the work done The problem is the time when we reacted the reaction times of the government of the country system to a problem that was widely expected The swine fever is endemic in Sardinia even if of different strain but above all it was announced so much so that as my colleague La Pietra recalled already almost a year ago had been proposed a deal assigned to the Commission that if it had found space and attention it would probably give the country system the opportunity to adapt and prepare for the emergency that was coming and that has arrived today 15.10 p.m. ZAFFINI follow The third consideration which is perplexed and also sufficiently disconcerted concerns the method of downloading the Regions It is not possible as happened with the Covid and in many other precedents that whenever this multicolored government rainbow so you are happy harlequin can not find a synthesis even on absolutely important and serious subjects there is always the escape way to say that the Regions will think about it in the sense that they will do what they want and believe It is a complete discharge and it is serious because beyond the thousand considerations of merit that we could make the immediate result that can be achieved and that will certainly be achieved is a diversity of regulations and disorientational plans with respect to the emergency and conditions for example of the venatory withdrawal There will be a migration of the venatory exercise because there will be regions that will allow to do some things and others of different orientation or of different weighing of certain ideological positions it is easy to define them which instead will not allow to do things even absolutely normal Therefore beyond the ugliness of this posture which sees the Government each time discharge on the Regions the responsibility to take difficult and probably sometimes even unpopular measures there is a serious problem of coordination that this text is not that it does not solve it does not even address Who will coordinate the plans of the Regions Not the Commissioner because it is specifically planned that the Commissioner should do only what concerns the emergency in the red areas In view of the emergency he will also do so outside the red zone as Mr Bruzzone tells me and I take it as a good thing having studied the measure better than I do can the Commissioner deal with all this Is it likely that the Commissioner will coordinate the regions for example on the activity of the hunting levy I do n't believe it That 's never gonna happen Who will do it then Will ISPRA Higher Institute for Environmental Protection and Research do this God damn it Who does that Someone can do this for example within the framework of the State Regions Conference but this figure must be identified because it is not possible that I repeat those who reside in a region bordering another Region find themselves having to deal with completely different measures norms and regulations there will be a general disorientation at the expense of precisely the ability to attack the problem and to face the emergency that I remember is serious very serious very heavy God forbid the leap of quality should happen With regard to all this Brothers of Italy will abstain from voting We have helped in the Commission as far as possible to improve the measure We would have liked to have done so to a greater extent if we had found a minimum of shore because the ideas we have presented have also been shared in a separate forum even if then in the logic of government activity all this has been sacrificed to the logic of majority It is clear Mr President that with regard to the need to create this coordination we will be following up with the instruments of direction in the hope that at least this will be brought to an end So let us welcome this method Mr President It does not seem to me that we have lost all this time it does not seem to me that we have sacrificed the times of conversion of the decree it does not seem to me that we have done anything serious If we were able to do the same thing all the time probably even the attitude of the Brothers of Italy Group in the Chamber could be a bit different from the dynamics and dialectic that we exchange on the occasion of the speeches in explanation of vote
Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President because of the misalignment that was noted by the rapporteur I believe that we have voted on the G24.1 agenda signed by Senator Ciampolillo In this regard we want to make it clear that the vote of the Brothers of Italy Group is against
MARIN L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to thank Senator Binetti for having expressed her support for the adoption of all the agendas showing a great cooperative spirit but also a great deal of sensitivity to all the issues that have been presented For the quality of the services the institutes of hospitalization and scientific care IRCCS are characterized as poles of excellence and reference centers for research activities performing hospitalization and care services of high specialty and represent a dynamic tool for the promotion development and application of innovative technologies and therapies in the field of health and biomedical It therefore seems appropriate to integrate IRCCS research activity with that on emerging and devastating diseases with functional cognitive decay which is a theme that has always been part of the themes of the League and which is particularly recurring in my personal choices in parliamentary activity and beyond It is desirable to encourage the integration of the same in the network of territorial structures becoming a reference of high specialization and support for the care and treatment of psychiatric diseases including through the adoption of models that provide an integrated multidisciplinary approach in order to build extraordinary plans of intervention aimed to implement permanently the health and social assistance services for persons suffering from mental disorders as well as to ensure in compliance with the constitutional principles referred to in Article 32 of the Constitution and especially in compliance with the legislation of other European States full access to care for patients and patients suffering from a mental disorder who choose to undergo voluntary health treatment TSV This is in order to ensure the taking in care and continuous care of the patient with critical and severe psychic disorder for which it is not objectively predictable to discharge from the hospital in the short term to prevent relapses promote stabilisation and circumvent mandatory health treatment TSO According to data provided by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD in its focus on Cutting down mental health severe depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia and other serious mental diseases reduce life expectancy by an average of twenty years compared to the general population similar to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases 5 percent of the world 's working age population has severe mental illness and an additional 15 percent suffer from a more common form This naturally reduces employment and productivity prospects and wages Direct and indirect costs according to OECD statistics may exceed 4 of gross domestic product In Italy 17 million people suffer from mental illness Moreover Italy is in the twentieth place in Europe as a number of psychiatrists working in the public sector and we are at the last place for the number of beds The reform of IRCCS is one of the actions identified in the PNRR to improve the country 's structural situation and is an integral part of the recovery that is also intended to be activated through European resources In addition as can be seen from the Update Note to the 2021 Economy and Finance Document it is a tool linked to the 2022 2024 budget maneuver On behalf of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione party I voted in favour and conclude with a quote A fundamental role for the support of people with mental illness continues to be played by families often burdened with a difficult management from an economic and relational point of view The role of the institutions is therefore important so that no one is left alone and everyone is allowed access to the most appropriate assistance throughout the national territory Mental health is a right that must be guaranteed to all Sergio Mattarella 10 October 2020
MARIN L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen this ratification is extremely important as it regulates the legal personality of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology on Italian territory The headquarters of the organization as is known is located in the city of Trieste the capital of the virtuous Friuli Venezia Giulia Region which I proudly represent in the Senate The choice of such a seat has given the city lustre and great importance within the scientific world The projects of the Centre in collaboration with the main universities of the Region are not only a great opportunity for development for the territory of Trieste and regional but also represent an important part for the advancement of innovation in the world of genetic engineering and biotechnology with incredible implications from the medical point of view Highlighting the splendid and fruitful relationship between the Centre and the Regional Administration I declare the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group
MARIN L SP PSd Az Mr President today 22 March is World Water Day and for this reason I bring to your attention an urgent appeal from my region Friuli Venezia Giulia in particular a note from the regional councillor Antonio Callegaris on the cause of the serious death of fish that took place these days along the river Isonzo The Regional Fisheries Authority has tried in vain to recover In particular situations such as the drought that has hit our borderland Slovenia is no longer guaranteeing daily peaks but only minimal flows This situation is not sustainable for the course of the Soča I appeal to the Ministers to put the matter to the neighbouring neighbouring State In addition a reflection is also needed on the issue of river dewatering for the creation of deeper areas creating real holes that allow the fish to survive in the event of drought at least for the sufficient time for recovery On this subject it is necessary to urgently provide for the environmental restrictions for the sacred river to the Homeland which condemn to a horrific death the fish fauna
Mr President let me sum up a few points which identify this measure With an amendment approved in the Chamber of Deputies the obligation to wear masks specifically type FFP2 was postponed from 30 April to 15 June on means of transport also school buses Article 8 lays down a vaccination obligation for persons aged 50 or over until 15 June with the application of a financial administrative penalty which in view of the latest compensation judgments I put in serious question Until June 15 guests in sporting events that take place indoors must wear the mask and also this is a twist without sense and without logic rigor In addition the rate of positivity is constantly decreasing Nevertheless our children are still forced to endure the mask for hours in a climate situation that is making tolerance impossible The League has long been asking for feedback on this issue but for incomprehensible reasons our children will have to arrive at the end of the school year to get rid of this punishment Then we come to the 19 million people not vaccinated or with uncompleted cycle This figure will remain almost constant because it represents that part of the population which apart from any recommendation sanction or imposition has already decided not to vaccinate and with great probability will never less so today vaccinate that we are no longer in a state of emergency However incongruity emerges in particular in Articles 10 and 12 which provide for extensions of contracts the recruitment of medical and nursing staff a category that at the darkest moments of the pandemic has been very naively defined
MARIN L SP PSd Az Excuse me Madam President PRESIDENT The debate is closed Of course we were absolutely on the subject Please Senator continue your speech MARIN L SP PSd Az Returning to medical and nursing staff angels have been called No gentlemen they are not angels and doctors you are not born you become with a university training course They are ground workers prepared and responsible for the interventions of their specific competence which with great responsibility and well knowing the risks of the trade have presented themselves to the health front as soon as their work has been requested The emergency phase closed on 31 March and national law provides for the possibility of stabilising staff who have carried out at least 18 months of emergency activity Covid Therefore part of these angels are essentially fired from the wards to be rejected in the cauldron of the precarious The survivors of the lanes despite the enormous experience gained in the field in extreme situations for twelve sixteen or seventeen and a half months do not fall within the stabilization plan Now more than ever we should review the parameters There is still a shortage of health workers particularly now that the health system is suffering from past management neglected by more than two years of pandemics In the face of the lack of doctors and nurses especially in specific areas psychologists physiotherapists general medicine doctors doctors and first aid nurses a system should be identified that enhances the skills not relegating them to a temporal duration It is not enough to extend contracts it is necessary to stabilize positions in order to reduce the precariousness and to reduce health deficiencies in hospitals thus providing for extraordinary intervention measures I shall end by thanking you Madam President and colleagues for their attention
MARIN L SP PSd Az Mr President my message is very clear do not touch the Alps Even in the case of harassment denounced by some ladies present at the Rimini meeting the Alps have demonstrated their unshakable and untouchable moral value The leaders of the associations expressed themselves without hesitation When the alleged culprits are identified they will be immediately expelled because the values of the Alps are others I would add if it is alpine because gentlemen you understand my perplexities when in an event in which thousands of visitors took part with the alpine hat in the head bought perhaps for the occasion at the last moment in a souvenir gazebo you point your finger at a perfect stranger Generalizing is foolish but these doubts are not enough to dissuade those today who are asking to stop the gatherings giving rise to an unprecedented denigratory campaign towards one of the most prestigious realities of which one can only be proud The Alps are always there to help those in need in every situation and without ever sparing themselves also to support cultural and social initiatives and to integrate public services in the most delicate moments During the pandemic critical phases their contribution was crucial As the mayor of Gorizia Rodolfo Ziberna has said I repeat that the Alps still carry on with force values that should represent the backbone of our society a sense of duty and sacrifice solidarity friendship spirit of belonging and attachment to traditions Mr President attacking the Alps indiscriminately means attacking all these values that represent them It is very dangerous because it is an attack on the soul of Italy the best and the most beautiful Italy Not even a favor is done to women who counterintuitively today for some unreasonable reason perceive a compliment or a goliardic externation as an act of violence I say this as a woman and as a psychologist my ladies you must resolve yourselves I do n't know who 's trying to get the image of the Alps dirty and I do n't know what the point is I do not understand this hatred of the Armed Forces as has also happened with regard to the Forces of Order After the media mud thrown on all black feathers the League considered it necessary to present a motion in every Municipality of Italy starting from Bergamo to commit mayors and presidents of Junta to express closeness to the National Alpine Association I represent Friuli -Venezia Giulia in the Senate and as spokesperson for my territory I hear myself saying that these people of nothingness are impregnated with the same ideology as those today who would like to remove the tricolor from the Castle of Gorizia and delete the names of Italian irredentists from streets and schools Friuli is already at work for the meeting of Udine in 2023 to hug back our beloved black pens Long live the Alps
"Mr President I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak about an issue which is certainly on the agenda of all citizens namely the debate on food in these days I take this opportunity to greet and thank on behalf of the Government the Undersecretary Centinario who together with Minister Patuanelli has been working on this subject for some time I would like to say that we are working on a very important subject the one we are debating today the nutri-score and the ten year Farm to Fork plan It is this new vision of food and how to consider respect for the environment from here to the next deadlines seen by the European Commission The European Commission wants us to reduce emissions into the atmosphere often and willingly by blaming farmers and a little bit of food in our country which they are calling into question with the nourishing score I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on Agriculture because we have achieved a sharing and it has not been very difficult to do so I warmly thank all its components one by one because everyone in a unanimous way has signed the commitment to go against the form of labelling let 's call it that of the nutri-score with which we Italians with our Made in Italy and our Mediterranean diet have absolutely nothing to do with it 17.08 Followed by Mr Vallardi Our initiative is to safeguard the great quality of the production of our farmers to which my compliment really goes because we are the country of biodiversity in Italy I remember that we have over 7,000 edible plant species We therefore do not understand why with the nourishing score often and willingly our products are labeled with the red bubble The emblematic case is that of olive oil which initially got the red bubbles and now the orange bubbles I can understand that if we drink a liter of olive oil it probably hurts us but if we use a spoon or two we know and we have always known that it does us very well Perhaps also for this reason we can understand why with the Mediterranean diet and especially with Made in Italy we are perhaps the longest lived country in the world I say perhaps because we are little exceeded by Japan that as longevity exceeds us perhaps a year and not more If we are the second country in the world for longevity it means that we eat well that the made in Italy must definitely be safeguarded and that the nourishing score has absolutely nothing to do with our food system I would like to make these quick comments to the Government because I am convinced that it will follow us in this initiative firstly because we are right secondly because the Committee on Agriculture has proved to be as compact as ever thirdly because if we are all united in a granite way and we are all working in one direction perhaps we can come up with it in relation to the European Commission which I would like to remind you did not allow citizens to eat crickets more than a month ago after allowing worms and grasshoppers to eat You understand then that perhaps the European Commission is on the wrong track Already in advance I would like to thank all those who will join this motion I hope that we will all work in one direction which is to enhance the great work and quality of the products of Italian farmers all of which must be defended together"
Mr President the rewordings put forward by the Government are certainly acceptable to me and to the Commission as they reinforce what has already been agreed
"VALLARDI L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to thank Mr Battistoni for being here today to talk about the very important subject of bees To speak of bees I take my cue from the last reflection as supposed as I think it is said in Campania and from the reference to the famous sentence of Albert Einstein It is a phrase attributed to him even if at that time we had no more objective data But if everyone claimed that it was his sentence we strongly believe that it is The sentence is as follows after four years that the bees should hopefully never happen disappear from the face of the Earth man would also disappear This is simply because bees pollinate about 85 90 percent of all edible plant species So if there are no more bees there are no more fruits and vegetables and the man would automatically disappear from the face of the Earth From this we understand how important this topic is Today we are too busy with some very important issues such as the Covid pandemic war food self sufficiency but in my opinion we need to focus a little more and here I am addressing the whole House and not the Agriculture Commission whom I thank which adopted this motion unanimously a year ago and pay more attention to the very important subject of bees I thank the Government which last year thanks also to the solicitation of the Committee on Agriculture has allocated over 10 million euros for the 50,000 heroes that are the beekeepers of this country I say heroes because to make beekeepers you do not have a great income you have to be bee enthusiasts but above all of the environment With climate change in progress raising bees and producing honey is very difficult We had the frosts we had a very strong death of the hives so we must definitely continue to talk about bees so that this passion is passed on to future generations We must continue with the teaching of our children of the pupils talking about them in schools but above all as well as talking we must also act accordingly For this reason I would like to mention the wonderful experience I had in the Province of Treviso of which I was a promoter where a local company the Savno donated 150 hives to the schools and municipalities of the Province This allowed to touch the life of the bees but above all to create new enthusiasts who then in turn will continue to transmit such a passion This must also be absolutely borrowed in other realities given the great difficulty we have with Italian soiling i.e. with the counterfeiting of honey against those that I would like to consider invaders of our markets not only Italians but also Europeans I am referring to Chinese honey which calls honey really an aberration since inside it there are glucose fructose and only a few drops of honey and then it is sold for honey and placed safely without any kind of labelling inside our supermarkets We must continue to work in this direction we must continue to defend our products but above all our beekeepers who I repeat are real heroes of environmental protection"
Mr President Government the measure on swine fever is certainly very important We discussed this intensively in the 9th and 12th Commissions I would like to take this opportunity to thank the President Parente and the two rapporteurs Senator Biti and Senator Bergesio Good work 's been done And this does not mean that it was a simple job because the theme of swine fever which I hope remains circumscribed is very serious for our country especially for the territories of Liguria and Piedmont It is a very serious and important issue on which two worlds have clashed and it has therefore served the great work of mediation of the rapporteurs and the Presidents to try to find a synthesis Two worlds have clashed the one to protect animals the animalist world and on the other hand the world of hunters both with their own reasons and positions to defend This has complicated the work in the Commission but it has been possible to sum up the measure that we are going to vote on today especially in defence of the breeding world which is a natural part of this country 's economy There is no doubt that important consideration must be given to the fact that swine fever has further highlighted the problem of wildlife and above all the damage caused by wild animals I would remind you that a year ago the 9th Commission adopted almost unanimously a resolution calling for an amendment to Law 157 of 1992 aimed at reducing damage from wild animals I believe that we absolutely must put our hands on a reform of Law 157 of 1992 because in this country we have too much damage from wild animals I speak of it as an animalist as a friend of animals but when too many animals go to destroy the work of an entire year of our farmers they are probably not so much friends of man anymore Therefore it is absolutely necessary to intervene with rationality not only for the eradication of swine fever but also to decrease the excessive number of animals returning them to their territories for example I do not believe that seeing wild boars around Rome is a great sign of civilization I do not believe that wild boars around many other cities of our country are a sign of civilization and I do not think they are even so good within those realities so we absolutely have to intervene The League has always been on these positions and as a party it is a friend of animals but it also stands in defence of the work of our farmers and we know at this particularly difficult time for our agriculture how much they need help That 's why we did this important job Today we will vote for economic aid not only to fence and eradicate swine fever but also to achieve a milestone in the initiative to revisit Law 157 of 1992 which we absolutely need
VALLARDI L SP PSd Az Mr President I greet the Undersecretary Centinario the Government and all my colleagues present at the debate on the resolution on issues relating to the minimum vital flow of rivers and streams important for the world of agriculture but above all for the environment I would really like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for their work Yes we voted unanimously but the subject is not at all simple As we have heard from the speeches in general but also from the explanations of vote it is not a simple subject on the one hand there is the survival of the world of agriculture and on the other hand the will of the many ecologists who in my opinion rightly want an ever better environment It is clear that there is water flowing in our rivers at stake it is not an absolutely simple subject at a very difficult and very delicate time of climate change which we have been hearing about for several years now We listen to a lot of discussions on this issue and a lot of people say that we have to fight climate change I do n't think we can fight climate change but we have to manage it something quite different This must be done absolutely because Italy among the European countries is perhaps the most affected by climate change We have seen them we are suffering them in the world of agriculture there are so many damages that our farmers and our farmers have suffered in recent years but the worst of the problems is the increase in drought in our territories About 20 of our territories a very important figure are at risk of desertification Given the lack of water flow in our rivers the salt wedge is climbing making it very difficult to cultivate land near the mouth of the river and therefore the sea We need to better manage the water resource in our country I remember that in Italy over the entire surface about 300 billion cubic meters of water fall every year There are many but we have a significant problem we cannot contain even 10 percent of these 300 billion cubic meters of water not even 30 billion cubic meters because we do not have water works and invaded enough to contain this water It would be very simple to have the water available and then be able to irrigate the fields but we are not able to manage the water resource What then I think it 's also quite simple almost elementary to solve the problem We must intervene economically as stated by the National Association of Consortiums for the management and protection of the territory and irrigation waters Anbi which I would like to thank for the great work it has done A work that we also did in the Committee on Agriculture with the survey on the water situation of all Italian consortia We have a leopard spot situation which is generally sufficient However we have understood from this resolution that a lot of money must be invested We have not invested many I address the Government represented here by the Undersecretary Centinario but Minister Patuanelli certainly knows that the money we have made available for the irrigation of our territory for the invaders is not at all sufficient We have not allocated a billion euros between the PNRR and the last budgetary manoeuvre we have put 960 million in order to manage the invaders in the country while it would take four times as much I believe that we must consider this calmly on everyone 's part I remember the fairy tale of Esopo 's cicada and ant in this country we are perhaps a little too cicadas we spend a little too much money in things that can also be useful but we cannot give them to everyone indiscriminately and then where they actually serve as for agriculture the money available is not there There is what I personally think is a fairly simple mathematical equation agriculture plus water gives us food but the same does not happen without water and we absolutely need food today more than ever The bad facts that are happening in the war between Russia and Ukraine have made us understand how much we need agriculture in this country they have made us aware of how much Italy does not have self sufficiency for food supply We must recover food sovereignty in this country they ask us to produce more corn they ask us for more grain because we discovered that we mainly imported soft wheat almost completely from Russia or Ukraine However how can we ask ourselves to do more agricultural production when we do not have enough water for everyone That little water we have available if we contend with civil use our aqueducts and our people and I remember how much we must invest in the aqueduct system of water management since in the national average more than 30 of the water consumed by our citizens before being consumed is dispersed because the pipelines are broken and lose 30 or 40 percent of the aqueducts depending on where they are are broken You have to invest it is easy to recover water We need to invest in agriculture 4.0 we need to invest in new irrigation methods we need to invest in invades because the water in our country comes yes I will always remember the 300 billion cubic meters of water but at the wrong time it comes too much when we do n't need it and then when we need it we do n't have it It is therefore very simple to solve the issue money is needed Before concluding my speech I would like to reflect on a debate that we had in the Committee on Agriculture when it was said that we would not present any other draft legislation because it was running out of time for the legislature Well I think we have time to get the money back I can think of the famous coach Vujadin Boskov who says that the game ends when the referee whistles Here let 's think about this In my opinion before the end of the parliamentary term whistle arrives we must absolutely find the money to invest in the world of agriculture on irrigation in favour of all our farmers That is why the Lega Group will vote in favour of the measure
VALLARDI L SP PSd Az Mr President I would just like a few minutes to thank you for the measure we are considering which has been signed by all my colleagues in the League and also by several other fellow senators It is certainly an important measure for the world of agriculture and for all those in our country who will want to try to make create produce and above all sell the products of tradition It 's a measure I 'm proud of I remember in fact that the Veneto Region had started this route ten years ago then adopted by the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region Today is an important day because the provision will be available to all the Regions of our country In particular I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture who have adopted it unanimously twice and have already voted in favour of it unanimously in this House This means that there is good especially at a time when agriculture is in great need of attention even for the sad events we 've seen The thought goes clearly to what is happening in Ukraine which has opened our eyes to the fact that in Italy agriculture has perhaps made some mistakes in the past we are no longer self sufficient and we have understood it since we import 60 of the grain We are not self sufficient because we have seen that for the dairy sector three out of every four milk containers if we look closely come from abroad all this after we have shut down our stables and have seized the current accounts from several farmers In conclusion Mr President we need much more attention to the agriculture sector we need much more money than we have made available we need much more resources especially in the irrigation sector on which we have only allocated EUR 1 billion in the PNRR You know that climate change is taking place and we need water for our land to produce One billion is very little not least because in a year we have been unable to find more than one billion but in one day we have found EUR 10 billion for armaments
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen Senators and Senators in my speech I will quote the words of an Italian entrepreneur Oscar Farinetti who spoke at a convention that took place at national level a few years ago who saw the participation of a great man a great entrepreneur a great person an example of willpower altruism and responsibility I am referring to Ennio Doris and since he has been missing recently I would also say to give him a round of applause In his speech Oscar Farinetti told us about a single peninsula in the narrow world from North to South inside a good sea where the good winds of our seas meet the fresh air of the mountains creating a unique situation in the world From there come some products such as for example the raw ham San Daniele son of the bora and the Dolomites the raw Parma son of the Apuan Alps and the Mediterranean the best pasta in the world that of Gragnano that is created where you meet the fresh air of Castellammare di Stabia with the air of Vesuvio Let us remember that our country our Italy covers the surface of 0.50 percent of that of the world As the President of the Vallardi Agriculture Commission recalled earlier in Italy we have 7,000 edible plant species remembering that Brazil is second with 3,300 plants We have 58,000 animal species 42,000 of land and air 10,500 of salt water and 5,500 of fresh water We are the second largest country in the world for animal species We have 1,200 native vines France which is second has 222 533 olive cultivars Spain second has 70 We have a huge wealth of biodiversity transformed into our agro food heritage Let me give you an example It is misleading that with the nourishing score you refer to 100 grams of product when the diversity of a meal unfolds its benefits thanks to a multitude of nutrients We have a thousand examples at national level if 100 grams of meat are indicated by the nutritious score as a dangerous or carcinogenic substance a variety is associated a multitude of plant products that have very important nutrients benefits that derive from the richness of the dish and not a nutritional richness of 100 grams Our task therefore is to educate a culture of healthy consumption as is our Mediterranean diet which is a UNESCO heritage We have a historical heritage of cultures that have transformed Italian biodiversity into thousands of dishes and courses A father 's job is to teach his son to consume even by tasting a glass of wine and not to let him continue to drink soda drinks or worse energizing preparations that give a tone to an evening of fun It is also up to us politicians to educate and oppose serial planning which is wanted by Brussels I would therefore like to thank President Vallardi and the Commission as a whole who has unitedly signed this motion The union makes force and we have also seen it in the battle that we are carrying out with Prosek in which we are united mainly on issues related to our country In the agri -food sector in defence of Made in Italy we will surely achieve important goals by contrasting the culture of homologation"
Mr President ladies and gentlemen Mr Secretary General we are finally here today to vote for this measure which speaking of farmers and farmers was much awaited in the context of parliamentary work In this difficult period in which in the post pandemic phase and in the current war phase the economy is in difficulty there is a need for answers Italian agri -food is a milestone in our economy That is why we must support it It will be the future driving force of the economy we will need goods but above all healthy and genuine products which can be used to drive the whole economy Article 1 defines organic production as a comprehensive system of farm management and food production based on the interaction between best practices in the environment climate action and the protection of natural resources This is a very long awaited signal but it must be clear that as I have already said at the time of the previous reading of the measure feeding and feeding on organic products is a choice as well as organic production it is a choice of principle but also an economic opportunity given the demand of consumers both in Italy and in the world But do not become organic farming the antithesis of agriculture with conventional methods they are two realities that can and must coexist Returning to the text of the measure Article 6 establishes the Italian organic brand to characterize the organic products obtained from Italian raw material marked by the indication Italian organic which is a protection for farmers and producers and a guarantee for consumers since it will certify organic products made from 100 Italian raw materials Beyond the controversy that has arisen in recent days the world of agriculture and agro food demands answers immediately It is a signal in a long awaited measure not to be stopped because it is thanks to this measure that the agricultural and agri -food economy will benefit more to redistribute on the economy of the territory and in our country
"Minister Lamorgese it is noted in the premise that Article 28 of the Decree Law of 1 March 2022 n. 17 introducing urgent measures for the containment of the costs of electricity and natural gas for the development of renewable energies for the relaunch of industrial policies the so called decree energy in conversion to the Chamber of Deputies allocates additional 905 million euros total additional compared to the 3.3 billion euros already allocated to allow the sliding of the ranking of the eligible and unfunded works of that decree of the Ministry of the Interior of 30 December 2021 relating to contributions destined to the municipalities with population over 15,000 inhabitants for investments of urban regeneration referred to in Article 1 paragraph 42 of the law 27 December 2019 n. 160 merged in the Mission 5 Inclusion and Cohesion Component 2 Social Infrastructures families community and third sector Investment 2.1 Investment in urban regeneration projects aimed at reducing marginalisation and social degradation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan This additional intervention was also necessary especially in the light of the introduction of the parameters for the division of the social and material vulnerability index IVSM whose specific weight has led to the exclusion from the ranking of numerous municipalities in the North The Law of 30 December 2021 n. 234 budget law for 2022 established in article 1 paragraph 581 a fund with a budget of 50 million euros intended for municipalities with a population of less than 5,000 inhabitants that have suffered a reduction of more than 5 percent of the population compared to 2011 that have an average income per capita of more than 3,000 euros less than the national average and that have the IVSM above the national average The implementing decree has not yet been published but in the projections developed by the National Association of Italian Municipalities ANCI it is evident that even in this case the Municipalities located in the North Regions are severely damaged by this criterion of allotment only 2.7 percent of the Municipalities of the North Regions would have access to this fund for the 0.7 of the funds allocated Given that in the awareness of the importance of support for the development of economically disadvantaged territorial areas it is also considered as important also and especially in the light of the serious economic crisis of the last two years and that from the international crisis it is assumed that it will continue for a not very short period to develop a policy of more equitable redistribution of state contributions to local authorities in order to support their development throughout the national territory The question therefore arises as to whether the Minister does not consider it appropriate to take prompt action on the definition of the criteria for allocating resources to local authorities taking seriously account of the objective of territorial cohesion while respecting a fair distribution of resources in order to avoid the repetition of situations of disparity as happened in the case of the allocation of resources relating to urban regeneration projects"
Mr President Minister ladies and gentlemen I am partially satisfied The Minister has explained to us that a legislative intervention would be needed to legislate in this respect and to guarantee an allocation on the part to 40 60 percent We believe it is necessary to continue with this legislative intervention because given the hand of ANCI Lombardia not of the League it is clear that beyond the municipalities that are financed and of which the Minister has spoken we would not respect the 40 South and 60 North part but not because we have something against the territories of the South because that is not the case but because for example even at a recent hearing of Minister Bianchi Senator Candiani who is a signatory to the question rightly said that there is a risk of creating social tensions that are absolutely unnecessary at this time We remember in fact that while for Molise are given 6 euros per capita per inhabitant in the Lombardy Region 4 thousandths per inhabitant 6 thousandths in Veneto and 12 in Emilia Romagna and Piedmont We call on the Government to commit itself to an automatism that will ensure that this part is respected
Mr President the motions before us today are very important given the importance of bees for the economy and agriculture As for the economy let us always say that it is important to move towards diversification of agricultural activity Farmers and farmers have diversified agricultural activity within their farms while beekeepers small entrepreneurs support the economy of their families family members and territory It is also important from the point of view of sustainability to avoid the sterilization of the crops of our orchards Let us remember that in China where there are practically no more bees beekeepers in fact they are not in this case are forced to artificially pollinate fruit trees We avoid getting to this and keep in mind the environmental disasters that are affecting us from the frosts to the drought of this period I would like to focus in particular on the first signed motion by Senator Vallardi where in point 2 the Government is committed to supporting the implementation of projects in primary and secondary schools I thank all the beekeepers who are already committed to this and have not waited for the aid of Parliament or the Government They carry out a daily activity alongside the volunteers of the associations In my territory of the Verona plain we have the association Verbena dell Adige which daily together with the mayors seeks to raise awareness of communities pupils childhood adolescence all young people on this important topic of economy and environmental sustainability They are exemplary mayors who give the availability of spaces for the positioning of hives and hives Here we have an example Senator Pirovano who is mayor of Misano di Gera d'Adda tells us also through the posts on social media the activities he does for his community It vibrates quivers and raises awareness of its own community its own countrymen and its small citizens who are our future These mayors engage with concrete actions in activities involving the world of school or alternatively the parish world linked to the activities of grest childhood adolescence young people as we said before Among other things we remember the benefits from the point of view of health healthy and genuine products those of our Italian beekeepers because we all know the properties as well as honey also of propolis Often in winter we have consumed candy and propolis products which serve excuse the brutal term to disinfect the oropharyngeal cable or throat It is recent news during the Covid period that a research of the CREA funded by the Ministry of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policy has emerged encouraging data Far from me to say that there is a valid alternative to vaccination Covid certainly however are confirmed the beneficial properties of propolis fruit of the work of our friends bees The synthesis of the research is that the certified presence of SARS CoV 2 outside experimental hives did not result in its presence inside with the entrance of the bees in particular in honey Evidently the propolis used by bees combined with their enzyme secretions turns out to be an excellent antiviral Sometimes nature meets us with what already exists It remains for us to value it through these motions and these commitments to the Government towards our communities and the environment It is important what we will do and also important beyond the economic measures adopted by the Budget Act and the Support Decree to continue to work economically to meet the environment and health
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen I am speaking with the following statement Since 1978 since I deal with swine fever I have never found the situation as difficult as at this time the disease is present in five continents and in over 50 countries and continues to progress very quickly This was said by Professor Manuel Sanchez Vizcaino Rodriguez a World Health Organization expert and director of the reference laboratory for PSA who infects domestic and wild pigs with a high mortality rate We had the pleasure of having the professor auditioned at the Senate The greatest danger and the first transmission channel the expert has explained are represented by the export of the infected pork meat And as far as Italy is concerned it is necessary to understand how PSA arrived in order to control it and prevent it from continuing to arrive The genetic sequencing of the virus in Italy has not yet been carried out explained Professor and it is even more important to know the origin i.e. whether it came from Europe the European Union or even Asia and how whether by ship or by road This is to avoid a second infection and make a rigorous surveillance program According to the expert the only possibility we have is the control of the disease which can be carried out on the basis of three individual actions early prevention before it spreads the containment of the infected area and the reduction of the population of wild boars It is certainly important as my colleague Senator Bergesio together with Senator Biti has already said for the measures that are being implemented with this measure He also recalled how fundamental the action of the individual regions is As far as my territories of origin are concerned I would like to remind you that at the beginning of the year the regional fauna venatory plan 2022 2027 was approved thanks to the work of the Junta the Regional Council and the Councillor Corazzari which states that it is an innovative programming document attentive to environmental requirements and to the comparison with stakeholders Explains the Councillor Corazzari with delegation to hunting and fishing With this plan for the first time each with its own specific characteristics some criticalities related to the wildlife that characterize our territory wolf and large carnivores on one side and wild boar on the other On the one hand by promoting integration with other regional programmers on the other hand by promoting in an overall framework the control activities of wild boar especially which as we know can also be a source of damage to protected habitats and more recently unfortunately as an active element in the fight against the possible entry of African swine fever into our territory In recalling the important issue that we are dealing with that is the health one let us not forget the implications on the productive and economic fabric and on the breeding of pigs which represents a fundamental economy for some regions of our country We have therefore also given importance to the serious economic fallout that might occur For the same reason I would like to take this opportunity to remind you of any important negative effects that might have on the agricultural sector It is true that we are talking about the livestock and health sector but the presence of this wild animal the wild boar is already causing major damage to the agricultural sector I am now quoting an article in a periodical newspaper on agricultural products Agrarian Informant entitled More corn in the fields wild boars are content At this time when we have major production problems about the import of raw materials related to the food and agriculture world it is important to reflect on the containment of these wilds and on the reasons I have just outlined I read from the article That of Mr. Claudio Orlandi of the Castellina farm in Borgonovo Piacenza is the desperate testimony of a farmer unfortunately one of the many who will no longer sow corn because of wild boars In 2021 it had to re-seminate 23 hectares of maize of the 25 farms dedicated to the cultivation and then collect little or nothing with a damage to the cultivations we speak of a single farmer which the expert estimated to exceed 45,000 euros In the article there is also a picture of the cornfield reset by wild boars I keep quoting Orlandi conducts a dairy farm with about 320 animals 150 of which are lactating the corn of farm origin was a fundamental element of the ration From the photos taken with the drone on my fields you can see well where the wild boars ate the first time because in those areas the seedlings are lower where they are higher there are holes because they entered later and finally a third where the bare ground remained At each reseed some damage was also done with the tractor because we had to enter the field trying not to crush the already born plants A huge job with an increase in costs seeds diesel time For years we have been calling for the eradication of wild boars in hill and plain areas where the herds have become sedentary by exchanging our fields for their supermarket says Filippo Gasparini president of Confagricoltura Piacenza Now with the nightmare of swine fever at the gates the killings are suspended It is a paradoxical situation we should increase the production of maize but wild boars eat it but we can not cut it down From all this we understand the importance of this measure I would like to remind you that from other points of view too for example if we look at the ecological aspect there are repercussions for the presence of these wilds Let us remember that in mountain areas we are working to ensure that the reduction of agricultural production does not take place But in the mountainous territory unfortunately there are and there are many damages so we have to work on this The bushes of the grassy mantles of the mountain territories where hay is produced and where herbs are collected to feed cows sheep and goats that produce cheeses typical of our territories is frustrated so there is a fall on the livestock on the breeding and also on agriculture The ecological aspect is therefore important but it is not enough to go to the stage of Coldiretti at the events of City and countryside united against wild boars if then there is no action that meets the world of breeding Let us also remember that an emergency is already in place and concerns the world of agriculture I therefore call on all my fellow Members to reflect on the need to work on this too"
ZULIANI L SP PSd Az Mr President I too will be very brief I would like to stress the importance of this measure and the opportunities offered to municipalities and local authorities as well as to the entire agricultural chain and the territories I quote below what was reported by the press at the time of the inauguration of the market at zero kilometer of Verona city of course there are many examples such as this at national level in other parts of Italy The Verona farms will be the protagonists of the covered market of Campagna Amica in the city center in Verona a space of 700 square meters fed with energy from renewable sources of agricultural origin and zero kilometer They will propose their fresh and seasonal products at zero kilometer such as fruit and vegetables oil rice and flour meat and sausages lake fish dairy products wine beer and gastronomy In addition it will be possible to experience sensory experiences through workshops tastes guided by producers and themed days The covered market will be a place for purchases and tasting of local products but also for the development of food and food culture Children and young people in collaboration with schools will be dedicated training moments to bring them closer to the values of nature biodiversity and non-waste I now report the statements of a mayor who took the opportunity together with Coldiretti and Campagna Amica on the fly Most important day for the city and the neighborhood said the mayor Federico Sboarina This covered market will become a generator of new interests for this part of the city that even with the return of tourists will soon come back to animate itself with new vitality like all our city This virtuous model of food education is a model of health because it is with the food education that people form not with the nouri-score Today 's news is the alarm launched by AFIPDO the Italian DOP Cheese Association on the risk that there is through the nourishing score on ten dishes symbol of DOP cheese I shall conclude my speech here and ask that we be able to deliver the written text PRESIDENT The debate is closed The Presidency takes note of this
Mr President I personally and the whole of the Brothers of Italy Group are extremely pleased that we are finally talking about nutri-scores without us bringing this issue to the attention of the public and of Parliament The other two times both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate the appeal had come from the opposition It is pleased that this time it is a Senate Commission that understands its importance and submits to the House a document that gathers the will of all political forces no one excluded to put an embankment not only ideological but also scientific to this absolute nonsense of the streetlight label that someone would like to pass as a scientific We had denounced it already a year and a half ago and brought to the attention a few months ago and today it is finally the heritage of the whole Assembly and political forces how absolutely anti-Italian and against Italian products this subtle attempt disguised as protection of public health Moreover objectively we have seen many attempts to exploit public health also in Italy and we have not had to wait for the European Commission or a part of the European nations to realize that this use of health is being used a little bit when there are no arguments and health is the only glue that allows political forces to maintain their status Now focusing on the Farm to Fork strategy we would not only have a direct criticism of the nourishing score but also something to say about certain more ideological than useful attestations such as those that the Farm to Fork document states We have denounced from the first moment the placing of constraints on Europe without looking at what nations do much more polluting and less attentive to the environmental issue which are among other things those to which in the coming years we should think about how to feed There is a clear contradiction which strikes quite a bit between the rules that we self impose in Europe to protect the environment and the exponential increase of the population around the world In fact even if we respect the environment as much as we need to start to feel like something that is one with us and not something third compared to us we have to ask ourselves how we can then feed a population of the world that is growing absolutely Otherwise we risk writing beautiful pages of anthology and philosophy and then not being able to make sure that all even the countries we call today in the developing world are able to develop as our thousand year old European civilization has managed to do in recent years I am talking about this because it seems clear to me that there has been more ideology than innovation in the document before us more attention to the merely consensual aspect than to a true and in depth analysis of what food production should be and above all what should be at their base namely agriculture I 'm a little out of the nourishing score theme I remember in fact that the nourishing score did not generate great interest today because we all realized the importance of healthy food It has not risen to the honours of the news because in this it has read a strong penalty of the agricultural sector which among other things would translate in the immediate but simply because this instrument penalizes the entire Italian supply chain from agriculture to those who make exports from the houses of transformation to those who care to maintain the territory Here we have succeeded as a nation system and not only through politics It is true that Brothers of Italy brought the theme to the attention of the Assembly but it is equally true that there are people in the Ministry who have sounded the alarm bell on the subject since 2018 Therefore we who would like to boast that we were the first to raise the issue do not realize that inside the Ministries there were already people who knew of the danger of what was happening and they are the same people who are helping us to clearly manifest the antiscientific nature of these operations but also the solution This is perhaps the first bell that should ring that is to say that we have such professionalism in Italy today that not only allow us to warn the danger first but even allow us with the elaboration and with the help of so many private companies to elaborate the answer to these problems The nutrinform battery is in fact the answer to these problems and is the result of the great participation of all the political subjects of all the technical subjects and also of private subjects that have made themselves available Federal the University of Luiss all people who built our position against the nutri-score If it had been a merely political position of opposition between states and between nations most likely the interests that have dominated until now those nations in which the nutri-score has flourished would have massacred us from the point of view of scientific evidence Today however we must thank the great technical work we have done in the Ministries I thank the Undersecretary Centinario for thanking in this case the entire structure Clearly someone must have the intellectual honesty to tell you things when they do n't work but to tell you that we Nazione Italia regardless of who is in the government today can count on absolutely valid professionalism To these however we must add other professionalism that allows us a higher step that is to increase innovation in agriculture to return to the yields of 1984 to cite a classic example that I always remind everyone In the year in which the farmer was painted as in the famous film by Pozzetto Il gioco di campagna in Italy the production per hectare of corn was higher than that of the United States It means that programming and innovation had been done by someone in previous years dragging them to the 1980s Today we must start from there from that concept of innovation which does not mean forgetting tradition but simply means having the tools to bring agriculture back to the level it deserves that is to a primary sector not only in name but also in general consideration Also because clean and sustainable agriculture is what our farmers already do gentlemen Wanting to take something for example we should not apply methods that resemble those that are used whenever the Ministry of Economy and Finance intends to make an intervention on the Municipalities that is the famous linear cuts that regardless of what the savings of the mayors have been are penalized both the good ones and those that as they say have not beaten a nail and for ten years perhaps have financed the potato festival every year constantly increasing its resources I see the same thing on the agricultural front we cut and demand from all the same decrease for example the use of plant protection drugs when we all know that Italy is the sixth country in the world for the gradual use of plant protection drugs I do not know one farmer who poisons his own soil in full awareness of the fact that the next year he has to go back to work on it no one kills himself in agriculture However there are even more global challenges such as climate change which must enable our farmers to have those instruments even chemical ones unfortunately for a share until we find a natural system that replaces the chemical system As when a human body is ill even a plant even a field even a cultivation need interventions which are chemical for the first part and then transform into natural interventions as soon as science and research allow it This is where we have to go back to investing chemistry research innovation in order to bring agriculture back not to the Heidi period but to a respect for the land proper to our tradition but that today must be combined with a strong innovation which must bring back
DE CARLO FdI I would like to end by thanking and appealing to the whole of Parliament to speak and speak about this by calling for more innovation and more research
The Ukrainian decree-law whose name is absolutely improper actually drags problems that are prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and it is probably the attempt to remedy at least towards public opinion twenty years of poor wrong or absent programming in the field of energy where a series of nos which we still see repeated and disconnected from the absolute reality of the facts have heavily conditioned the past energy policy of the nation No to drills before no to nuclear even before perhaps if it made sense in the eighties now we can safely free from any ideology sit down at a table and realize the energy policy of a nation without preconceptions and without ideological positions that then condition our dependence on other sources for twenty years The ecological transition is excellent Who is more environmentally friendly than someone who deals with the environment and therefore agriculture I do n't think so This is why the waste cycle in agriculture must be closed through agricultural products following all the rules to safeguard public health I do n't think anyone can question that But the fact that the cycle of rejection and the circular economy pass also through the valorization of what then agriculture leaves is an absolutely objective fact it is part of ecology and it is what happens normally in nature All these repeated nos have put us in a condition of great dependence also from the exquisitely agricultural point of view so much so that the important increases of fertilizers 170 percent of the feed 90 percent of the diesel 129 percent strongly condition our enterprises that they will find only a limited benefit compared to the burdens that they will suffer To say it is not Luca De Carlo who could be accused of partisanship because he is one of the senators who are in opposition but a report of the Agricultural Research Council and the analysis of the agricultural economy Crea according to which 30 of farms will have a negative income Before the crisis of these prices which is before the invasion of Ukraine only 7 of farms had a negative income Among other things there are great differences between the granivore farms which make great use of feed such as pig farming and perhaps even cereal farms compared to other farms I remind everyone that dairy farms for example are remarkably on their knees Many farmers today have chosen not to start the production cycle because they consider it uneconomical and do not buy pigs to make pigs All this in an already very difficult context arising from the problem of swine fever virus Among other things it has been known since 2014 that it would also land in Italy especially after the first evidence in Eastern Europe This problem was given a limited response with poor programming without going to the heart of the question concerning the containment of the number of wild boars that were the true viaticum of transmission of the virus I would remind everyone first of all to myself that the Senate Agriculture Committee itself had tabled a resolution to contain the number which was voted on last year well in advance of when swine fever occurred I leave aside the considerations of those who see a wild boar feeding their puppies in the center of Rome giving it a bucolic and almost affective vision seeing it as a form of restoration by the nature of the spaces that man has taken from it That is the failure of environmental policies because a wild boar forced to wander in the waste of the city center is a wild boar that no longer has a space on which to live in its natural environment So we can't pretend that the cause has become the problem That is where we should act but I repeat we must act not with the belly but with the programming It is not the immediate consensus that will give answers to energy and agricultural policies It 's programming what 's good for the nation today What we decide today could be unpopular but it could also be what our children will need in 20 years time So let 's stop running behind the easy consensus of those who like most on a post and focus on what needs to be structural interventions We certainly cannot do this alone it is true but we must do it in Europe with what has hitherto been a political dwarf and a bureaucratic giant that has not facilitated the national states but indeed has put the poles in the way of their development I am referring to those who have decided knowingly that we should no longer produce in Europe especially in the agricultural sector and that raw materials should be bought where they were cheaper and the same policy as the one that dismissed this attitude as naïve This was not a naïve attitude but the failure of twenty years of agricultural policies in Europe which also heavily influenced our producers Think of the question of milk quotas which are now the subject of an amendment to this measure Our requirements are only covered by 85 of domestic production 15 is milk we take from abroad How is it possible that programming was right How is it possible that to date the value of that milk is paid in an anti-economic way A study of the Crea shows that the cost of producing a litre of milk is 46 cents of euro this before the war in Ukraine while the one that was cleared under normal conditions except where there are DOP productions such as Grana Padano is between 38 and 39 cents of euro Is this a sale below cost Yes it is Is this a system that can structurally stand No it 's not Doing these interventions is almost like trying to shovel evil with a glass without acting structurally where there are our great shortcomings I believe that the great structural reforms can be done not with a government within which there is everything and the opposite of everything but only with a government whether on the one hand or on the other that has a clear agenda a vision of the world over the next twenty years We do not need a government that follows the consensus or worse still the maintenance of its status quo
"Mr President I should like to begin with a point of order It would appear that this time the government is not oriented to raise the question of trust That would already be a huge step forward In fact let us remind everyone that you have arrived you have arrived to the fiftieth trust We also remind those who may have noticed the times in the other legislatures or in the other governments that preceded this complained about the use of trust It means that 50 times you have expropriated Parliament from its role and so today that seems not to be the case let us record first good news I wonder if we will be able after so much lack of training to discuss the amendments In fact Brothers of Italy did not withdraw the 50 amendments and indeed will try to improve the measure in our examination precisely because it will finally be possible to discuss it in this House In reality however a part of trust in our view you have already asked for it It is an extra parliamentary trust not that extra-parliamentary one that much likes part of the hemicycle but an extra- parliamentary trust that your leader the highly authoritative Mario Draghi has asked a Council of Ministers which lasted eight minutes Eight minutes in which evidently long winded he told you or so or I go home terrorizing Ministers and party leaders with the possibility of possible elections which is terrible because competition exists and must be sought everywhere except electoral competition Europe does not ask for it and we do not need it we do not need it we do not need it today we need stability Today in your opinion we need stability In eight minutes then the Premier used his authority That authoritativeness which we would like him to use in Europe on foreign policy issues which he would use in Europe to explain that the Bolkestein directive has nothing to do with this measure We would still like you to explain that the PNRR funds are not being called into question if the issue of bathing areas is not being applied which has nothing to do with them We would like you to explain to Europe that this PNRR does not work because the conditions on which it was born have changed and that today a PNRR of war is needed to address the issues that have become more acute at the time when one nation Russia has invaded another sovereign nation Ukraine That authoritativeness which becomes authority spends it in saying quoting an old advertisement O so Either Pomì that is either do so or go home All those who until then had tabled penguins of amendments withdrew them because this agreement was found yet another agreement to the bottom on the skin of the beaches We are talking about 30,000 companies which are virtually broken because Europe is paying us for this operation as we heard earlier in this House It is no wonder that the Europe of finance is paying for a sale of goods that are not scarce as the reports report the beaches are not a bad thing so there is not even that premise to put them into competition Nor is it surprising that Europe is saying that it is selling and that it is paying us to sell goods to multinationals because that is something we have been seeing for several years For many years we have heard that Europe has been asking for this but I thought that that era was over Instead Europe the Europe of multinationals and not the Europe of nations and peoples is calling for that era back We do not give in to this economic fatalism because we too believe that inflation and inequality are a problem Of course inflation has seen prices rise above all in the energy and agricultural sectors perhaps because programming has not been planned Will anyone take the blame for not having made the programming or is it the fault of the adverse fate I believe that it is not the fault of adverse fate but of those who have ruled this nation in these years and in the previous ones so it is better for someone to have an examination of conscience before doing it to others The same discourse is about inequalities so much so that excessive liberalism has led to an increase in inequalities not to greater equality on the contrary I invite you to go and look at studies even on the Internet in the absence of other sources Inequalities grow when the State does not also deal with the market liberalism has failed and excessive liberalism continues to prevail in this House even on the part of those who should absolutely oppose it I consider this measure to be a bad one and that is why we have tried to improve it You think that in the Commission we have also tried to make our own the amendments proposed by other political forces knowing that many times the government has rejected them and then proposed them again perhaps in a subsequent measure because it obviously felt them to be of common sense We were hoping that he would do the same thing but nothing happened In the Commission the signatories themselves rejected their amendments and I believe that this is the plastic demonstration of how the general interest was not pursued but the purely personal one"
"Mr President I begin my speech with a political consideration I like Senator Ferrari believe that a national strategic plan to address such an important issue as water must be done with a strong and legitimate government Therefore I invite the Movimento 5 Stars to maintain the position and to pull the plug on this Government so that you can go and vote and finally have a government serious and legitimated by the ballot box So we 're perfectly on the line In order to return to the subject of information and I thank the Minister for his always precise and timely participation in the work of the Assembly it would seem strange that a nation like ours where there is more rain in Europe and there are more waterways we should discuss a water crisis We have 7.596 streams 1,242 of which are rivers and we have 342 lakes not to mention the fact that the Italian peninsula is bathed on three sides by seawater with the opportunity therefore to act as they do in certain parts of the world in which salt water is transformed into fresh water to be used for many purposes However this water crisis is only part of the crisis that is affecting agriculture today partly because perhaps the strongest blow that has been struck by our farmers has been the increase in traction costs those relating to fuels which have seen fishing and agriculture as a real waste on which we have not yet managed to put a piece of equipment and which sees the great concern of their operators The problem of the water crisis is also a major one because 85 of agri -food production comes from irrigation crops I remember that the use of water for agricultural purposes exceeds 60 while that of industry and energy is 25 and civil use as Mr La Pietra rightly mentioned is between 10 and 15 By the way at a time such as this ecological transition supposed or at least begun the water resource represents 40 of the green energy of this nation But precisely because of the drought energy losses are estimated or in any case decreases of an equally 40 thus placing a problem of type not only irrigation to the crops but also energy I say this among other things as mayor of a coastal municipality a municipality that has a portion of the lake for which it emerges annually the difficulty to match all the requirements from the water point of view the industrial one the tourist one the food one and the agricultural one Every year mountain lakes are severely penalized by a form of withdrawal a little for agriculture and a little for energy demonstrating how the blanket is already short during normal years and not only during the years of the crisis He rightly mentioned the Minister in 2003 2007 and 2017 almost a five year plan which is actually missing from us partly because drought or rather drought problems has caused damage for about 15 billion in the last twenty years Today there is the ballet about the cost of the water problem of 2022 the Minister cites 3 billion some 4.5 billion but in short it is of this order with sectors penalized much more than others think about the conditions of rice in Biellese and Vercellese but also in the Po Delta Products such as Carnaroli rice Arborio and others are clear examples not only of excellence but also of biodiversity whose valorization and care are one of the objectives we have set ourselves not only for environmental but also economic purposes in order to enhance those products that cannot be replicated in another part of the world The problem is wide and the premise I have made demonstrates it but the many speeches by my previous colleagues and above all that of the Minister also demonstrate it Therefore given the premises it should also be possible to give concreteness to the possible operations that we should do in order at least to try to alleviate the situation out of about 4.5 billion PNRR only 400 million are dedicated to new invaders which according to many operators including large trade associations and agricultural associations would represent a good start to make sure not only to have water always available but even to reverse that trend that Italy sees resounding taillight compared to those nations that manage to use the waters Veneto even my region is the one that has the ability to recover water only at 5 even 7 points below the national average And this is a huge problem especially for a region with a strong agricultural vocation Then there are the millions destined for the modernization and efficiency of irrigation systems In recent years it has been farmers who have made innovations on these systems It is also true that in our country there are not only large farmers there is also a galaxy of small entrepreneurs who may not be able because of the size of their company to access this type of contribution and therefore to improve their efficiency I say all this because in Italy there are already 526 dams and 20,000 small invaders However despite such a deployment of forces and realities the national average of the retained waters is only 11 Minister in my opinion you should try to beat your fists a little bit in Europe in order to be able to increase the resources of the Next generation EU and achieve greater flexibility with regard to state aid In fact between de minimis and other issues farmers despite being able to benefit from certain contributions do not actually land them In a nation then with an exposure on the coasts so large there is then to counter the salt wedge that is the phenomenon for which inside our rivers enters for 20 kilometers salt water thus depriving the irrigation capacity of the lands that are found near that water of a strong numerical component We should therefore implement the construction of anti-salt barriers consider finally the desalitors and understand through the studies of the nations that have already made them if it is now convenient and what the price will be that we will have to pay to have fresh water through the use of salt water There are experiments in this sense In Israel they have been doing this for a long time and diplomacy should work there to have available the technology that we do not have today and to realize with a mathematical calculation whether this is feasible or not All of our colleagues have focused on precision agriculture We must succeed in spending less and cultivating more We must increase production and not reduce it as the Farm to fork would like but at a lower cost The ecological transition is done through technological improvement and not through the happy decline Another important step is the recovery of rainwater We can't imagine this nation without a serious rainwater recovery program Minister we have put so many proposals on the table some of which are already on your agenda You unlike us have a chance to put them on the ground Do it not for you or this government but for the nation 's sake"
DE CARLO FdI Mr President I am obliged first of all to clarify from the point of view of the method the resolution to which Mr La Pietra referred earlier voted by the whole Commission but never arrived in this House the resolution on bees It is a pair with that on wildlife which with as much laziness this House has forgotten to treat so much so that we continue to see boars spinning rocketing for this city often closing also the cycle of waste in the sense that what the municipal administrations of Rome should do in this city wild boars do brilliantly And we saw them in their last apparition even on the beach of San Felice al Circeo where rightly after many months of work in winter autumn and spring autumn in the context of the cycle of waste they rightly allow themselves their vacation so much so that we have seen a video where they even stand above the deckchairs The inertia in dealing with this theme therefore has led this city to be almost a joke from the point of view of the wild boar 's life We would not however want the same thing to happen with bees Mr President who sees us from outside could say what are you doing With all the problems we have today do you worry and talk about insects as apparently insignificant as bees In fact the bee is doing exactly what we should do in the agri food field today Thanks to bees in fact today there are productions pollination and therefore the greater production which is what we need today In the very short period we will have to feed a constantly growing world population and we cannot do so regardless of the existence of pollinating animals So it 's no accident that we 're dealing with this issue The bee is somewhat opposed to the policies that the European Union would like to put in place namely those of the farm to fork which aim to reduce the production of the planet The bee on the other hand does exactly the opposite for thousands of years it has contributed to increasing production And that is the only reason why we should discuss the subject today take the philosophy of the bee and contrast it with the philosophy of the living room ecologists who do not care about the production because so much they will probably be destined to eat synthetic foods Since we do not give up on this we are deliberately and selfishly on the side of the bee As if that were not enough the bee is also the symbol of a sustainable world Colleagues it was 2008 when my colleague Balboni he reminded me earlier already put at the centre of the political agenda with a question the problem of the bees and the sustainability of the environment for the life of the bee as a testimony of how not only he was the avant garde ecologist but already this movement that always attentive to these issues poses questions and solutions other than demagogy but much closer to the practicality that we should all have As my colleague La Pietra has said as an agricultural sector we have already intended to fulfill many commitments that have been included in our motion today making sure that every municipal council every institution or institution can legitimately decide in favour of a greater sensitivity to the topic of bees through resolutions that we have prepared and made to vote by many municipalities I am talking about those of Veneto that have been really many and some avant garde municipalities like San Pietro Mussolino with the mayor Tasso has even placed the bees at the center of a project of revitalization itself of the municipality through a whole series of themes of bee interest that make that an important town But it 's not just that We believe that through the bees we will save this planet and we will do so in the simplest way that of the conservatives that is trying to preserve what our fathers have left us to deliver to our children a better world
"IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen Mr La Pietra first took a rather ruthless picture of the management or non-management of wildlife in this country It is a vision still heavily conditioned by ideology by a very little knowledge of the balance between wild and domestic and above all perhaps conditioned by a vision now too urbanized of rural Italy If until thirty years ago 70 percent of the Italian population lived in rural areas and therefore knew the mechanisms and the life of Italian rurality while only 30 percent lived in urbanized areas we are now moving towards a society in which in a matter of very few years the percentage of fact is reversed We will have over 70 percent of people living in cities and 30 percent in rural areas I leave out all the considerations here concerning those who will maintain and maintain those rural areas in case they become depopulated On this I believe that there are other instruments with which we must intervene and on which we must work That 's because I do n't give up on this urban centric vision On the other hand I believe that the city is functional when it can rest on a rural hinterland which allows it to feed itself and still have control of atmospheric agents so that they do not condition it as happened with the floods of certain rivers even in Veneto with respect to environmental safety But this is another game I would rather focus on the anti-rural and anti-agricultural vision of a certain part of this Parliament as well If anyone can be happy and happy to see wild boar mom feeding wild boars in the center of Rome I on the other hand consider this a failure not only of the policies of containment of the wild but also of the policies of urban management because it is not normal to see a wild animal living in the urban area That is a twist of this nation not a serious plan to contain wildlife for the benefit not only as in this case of the pig raised and therefore the possibility of contracting a disease which appears in Europe in 2014 therefore there has been some time to study containment mechanisms The European Union finances a project of more than € 10 million for vaccine research We are very fast quite rightly to find a vaccine for the Covid 19 but we are at a time when we should act to contain diseases that weigh heavily on national GDP In fact at this moment even our pig chain is heavily conditioned by some possible speculation at the center of the chain itself which leads farmers to be recognized an increase of a few cents and other contractors such as slaughterhouses see increased expenditure on the chain of processors and sausages by more than 28 40 percent We must be able to ensure that farmers incomes are stable under normal conditions which is also heavily influenced by the increase in the cost of feed The data of the Agricultural Research Council and the analysis of the agricultural economy Crea photograph a situation according to which one farm in four pig and cereal sectors will not be able in the next campaign to buy the inputs to make the production cycle This means that 27,000 companies are at risk We must start from this assumption even when we deal with health and issues such as swine fever which today can only refer to a geographical area but which certainly have a very wide reflection on the national market Some nations Mr La Pietra has rightly mentioned have already closed the import of processed products from Italy today penalising the market We all know and we all know that in Europe there is a certain behavior on the part of some sovereign nation Today the term sovereignism in the sense of having a national interest has returned to fashion quoted by Macron and not by Giorgia Meloni Luca De Carlo or Patrizio La Pietra Those nations today have all the interest in seeing erodes a slice of the market today the prerogative of the Italians to replace it with slices of the internal market I think of France and Germany who enjoy seeing us bogged down in bureaucracy also with reference to issues such as swine fever which should unite us and above all make us ring a bell of alarm with respect to some vision I do not say old fashioned because no one a few years ago would have dreamed of seeing wild boars in the center of Rome but that is now spoiled by a kind of widespread Heidi syndrome according to which the goats make you hello while the pig farmers are great polluters and murderers Let 's clear the field from all these cartoon visions because that 's not the case The reality is quite different and the majority in Europe has also noticed it which a few weeks ago had voted on rules such as that of the Farm to Fork or set aside which predicted the reduction of production with the chimera of climate change which objectively exists We must therefore rethink our agricultural policies and thinking about agricultural policies is already a step forward In fact so far little has been thought about and zero planned unless someone gets up in this House to say that they have a serious strategic plan based on concrete things that will be illustrated today I 'd love to see it and also discuss it To date however we have seen a counter order comrades of Guareschi's memory according to which what was voted yesterday by the majority in Europe that is the Farm to Fork is not good today Greater areas are being asked to be cultivated All perfect but you do n't fool someone who 's suspended by a year means having land available with the same yield as those who have been working for maybe ten years Otherwise it means understanding little or nothing of agriculture It 's okay to suspend it and even extend it for as long as possible We are talking about an agriculture the Italian one which is objectively one of the most sustainable in Europe After that we can improve We too can improve legislation since sometimes we do so in short circuit with what we did last week We must however start with two assumptions The first is that we must feed a growing world population the second is that we must guarantee our farmers a safe and secure income In fact there can be no income security systems only for adverse events and there is no guarantee to producers of the changed or changed effects of the market It is not possible today and we must work on this 10:55 a.m. Followed by De Carlo But we have to do this by taking up this vision that the farmer is the big polluter and the one with the trendy boots who lives in the city all week and goes to the mountains once a week is the real environmentalist You were wrong The true environmentalist the one who preserves the environment forever is the farmer The figures tell us our farmers have reduced the use of pesticides by 20 while France and Germany which today teach us have increased it We have an emission of 30 million tons of CO2 compared to more than 60 million in Germany and 76 million in France the same countries that today come to dictate the rules and expect to teach us what sustainability is We have companies that have invested there are reports the last of which is the one that came out of Confagricoltura which mentions how many companies and how many investments on innovation made by our companies Unfortunately we have very bad water management but it must be improved because the other nations yes have done better than us We have 11 percent of water held in our rainwater basins while the other nations have reached almost 50 percent So let 's question ourselves and copy from the great nations but let 's put Italian sustainable agriculture at the centre even when we do these measures otherwise we lose focus and go to beat those who made sustainability until yesterday like pig farmers also in this case for the benefit of those who have never done it and today would enjoy the same rules"
DE CARLO FdI Mr President our vote is absolutely in favour of this measure especially in view of the fact that those who speak come from a Province such as Belluno which does not have the possibility of intensive agriculture but which enjoys benefits and benefits from this law which in fact puts all small farmers and producers in a position to have aid and support It seems paradoxical however that today we are dealing with these albeit important issues when we have a national problem which is more related to supply self sufficiency and independence than to details such as those that can be zero kilometer rather than anything else I appeal to the Undersecretary I know that he is particularly sensitive to these issues so that we can really bring the church back to the centre of the village and put the primary sector back in that strategic and primary place that agriculture deserves but which deserves above all our agri-food industry which benefits most from our agriculture I would remind you dear Undersecretary that when you decide or make any kind of proposal which will go towards a greater form of independence and also a new vision of agriculture that puts innovation alongside tradition you will always find the Brothers of Italy Group as in this case favorable
"Mr President my fellow senators I renew my doubts and I urge questions worthy of interest such as those who want the nutri-score and those who are structuring the Farm to fork If there are politicians but above all our producers and producers who have many doubts I do not understand why there are associations acting as lobbyists who are in favour of this devious mechanism which is also easy to understand but very cowardly It is a method that compares coca cola to olive oil because they are two liquids as if I compared a shark to a red fish because they are two fish It is therefore a method against excellence on a request already well packaged and conditioned and it is annoying that among the associations that are part of Euroconsumers there is also Italian Other consumption in favor of the nutri-score with 377,000 members who I think do not know that this is part of an international network that the BEUC to which it is registered does not accept billing also 200 million per year and seems to be investigated also in Panama papers Besides them there are also online newspapers always linked to them therefore to think wrong is sin but often you guess as someone said And then there are wealthy wealthy people who push for artificial steaks and then produce them in bioreactors consuming not only energy but also water There is above all one fact if Italy does not accept the nutri-score it is also an objective reason because our diet UNESCO heritage allows a higher longevity in Europe a better life expectancy Germany for example is seventeenth and the lowest index of obesity than in France another country that wants the nutri-score has increased by 145 from the eighties to today There is to worry instead about infant obesity that is increasing precisely because it is watering down and polluting the Mediterranean diet That is precisely what we do in our Commission the defence of the Mediterranean diet and I thank all the members of the Agriculture Commission starting with our President Vallardi because we are defending the more than 1.5 million companies that allow us 15 of GDP in Italy with over 500 billion turnover We have also done enough with the Government we have achieved some results the defence of balsamic vinegar of the milk supply chain we have lowered excise duties on beer set up a fund for African swine fever obtained an increase from 105 to 160 for the fund for farms damaged by atmospheric adversity Still five million to save beekeeping 20 million plus 56 million for gastronomic excellence 500,000 euro for aromatic plants 25 million for the promotion of wine We defended Prosecco from Prošek and the Italian Chianti label we put two million for the distribution of food we wanted the register of agro-mechanicals and we also wanted a fund of five million for the purchase of machinery and software for agriculture 4.0 We do this because we put our face on and we do it with the undersecretary Gian Marco Centinario a prepared person therefore this is also our task to be in the government The food is narrator of Italy and if we do not defend it we will lose smells and flavors that have made us grow healthy The Farm to fork from the farm to the table is desirable if it is from Italian farms to tables all over the world and not the other way around It is like the history of energy we make it produce in France and we buy it at a higher cost There are doubts Some of the Farm to Fork methods are good reduction of pesticides and antimicrobials fertilizers loss of nutrients but as the Department of Agriculture of the United States of America says you even have to import fruits and vegetables practically the Mediterranean diet A greater demand would entail a higher cost a greater shortage of products and pollution of the Mediterranean diet and that is how much we risk being caused by the Farm to fork Then there is the other huge problem of Italian sounding which could be even more relevant We already lose 100 billion compared to 50 billion from Made in Italy We must therefore also pay attention to the contradiction that exists in Europe when trade agreements are signed with Mercosur where it is polluted and where imports are permitted Nutri-score and Farm to fork are therefore commendable projects but Italy can do without them if our Mediterranean diet is affected synonymous with good growth and health"
"Mr President before I begin my speech I feel obliged to express in this House my closeness to the Ukrainian people and hope that they will smile again free in a free nation Colleagues it certainly must not be the infringement procedure by the European Commission that requires us to review the rules on public contracts but the common sense of politics and above all respect for the work of Italian companies The league has the heart of the work and all the administrative machinery linked to them and the proof is the amendments tabled and also approved which promote a change of pace with a reorganization of the sector more timely and organic starting first of all from the legislation The Commission 's text lays the foundations for a new law on more streamlined and even more balanced public contracts The League has enriched the law with a series of amendments that have as principle the respect of the sacrifice and the risk of the enterprise I am thinking for example of the amendment for the protection of Made in Italy in supplies of the amendment for the repentance of costs in case of controlled increases see today the increase of raw materials and the cost of energy I am still thinking of the amendment which also gives small businesses the opportunity to participate in large contracts because they are divided into small lots The League thus grows small territorial enterprises and speeds up the work of the big ones The amendments of the League provide for the simplification of the rules that constitute the professional wrongdoing and the identification of the real causes that determine the exclusion from the notices therefore clear and concrete answers of support This is not only due to discipline in line with the directives that have been required for some time or to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development but above all to ensure that activities can be organised for material and administrative investments The proposed amendments aim to encourage good and rapid implementation of the work including by means of sanctioning or rewarding mechanisms In fact rules are needed to avoid unfinished works such as 410 works by 2020 with a value of more than 2.5 billion In this regard the League 's agenda for the digitisation of the Italian construction and public administrations sector is well worthwhile also in the interests of rapid monitoring and monitoring The League presented and structured an amendment in the delegation to the Government to limit the use of the draw because we believe it is right to reward professionalism With Amendment 1,155 we wanted insurance policies to be provided for by the contracting authority With the agenda already Amendment 1.81 we recognize the decisive role of the professionals involved in the participation in races With amendment 1.247 text 2 we intervene in the objective and social value of the collective catering service It has the value of nourishing and educating children the elderly and the sick and rewarding the quality of the offer with criteria that enhance the food supply policies and recommend criteria that reward the planning of communication and information with a prevention of waste and a sustainability of the meals also verify the socio- economic reliability and the certifications and also determine the exclusion from the contracts of the collective catering of an improvised catering We have structured the amendment that enhances the professional experience gained over the years by technical directors once again giving priority to meritocracy and professionalism The work of the and in the Commission to which thanks go for the fruitful and constructive commitment beginning with the offices colleagues rapporteurs in particular Senator Pergreffi and the Government with the constant and constructive presence of the Senator Deputy Minister Bellanova I hope he will find effective delegation to the Government because the commitment has structured a series of amendments that will create synthesis for good rules of public contracts As well as for this law delegation the League is to the Government for the good of companies and its professionals If we were not in the government we would only have hypothesized without bringing to compliment ideas and requests able to give answers certainties and programming For the League it is also time to be criticized but not to criticize it is time to do but not to let it be done For the sake of the Italians we always put our faces on"
Mr President I honestly did not know that Clearly there is some doubt I accept the call for the withdrawal of the original agenda and since it has been reworded I accept the rewording It has been accepted in the Commission and that is the choice
"RUFA L SP PSd Az Mr President Minister I would like to thank the previous speaker for her announcement Unfortunately the real defeat is the need to vote as in any institutional room in the world on a motion with the objectives well explained by the Undersecretary Sisto Unfortunately even today there are at least 59 wars and conflicts with thousands of victims a year Let us think of the conflict in Afghanistan Myanmar Yemen Ethiopia and Syria with an impressive number of deaths displaced persons prisoners and people suffering from hunger From February 24 2022 another of those wars that is understood only after it has manifested itself realizing how much fear it makes To date in Ukraine 4,560 deaths and 5,691 wounded without calculating psychological and physical deaths consequence of satanic atrocity for possession of resources for economic cultural religious and demographic possession possession and supremacy where treaties conventions and promises fall in the face of atrocious ends and revenge The horrors of the battle of Solferino in 1859 prompted Jean Henry Dunant to set up the Red Cross From 1864 until now numerous conventions of international law have been signed up to the four Geneva Conventions the Convention for the wounded and sick in the countryside for the wounded and the sick on the sea for the treatment of prisoners for the protection of civilian people in times of war Two other protocols had to be added to these in 1977 the protection of victims of international and non-international armed conflicts In 2005 always out of necessity and always in Geneva a third additional protocol was introduced with the need to adopt a distinctive emblem following the attack on the Red Cross and the Red Crescent In this simple and quick excursus we understand how history did not teach did not make us understand how atrocious human wickedness is especially at war There is never a fair war and there is never a war with a winner because they all lose when the dead or dead living like the victims of rape remain on the ground These acts war crimes and crimes against humanity are the manifestation of animal behavior dictated by hatred and violence and contempt of the enemy We should stop and think how cruel the minutes hours and days of such squalid violence are Those who commit them will never have a justification Let us ask ourselves what will remain of the body and soul of those women of those men and of those children raped and raped and forced also to witness such atrocities With victory comes the loot has been a cry of war for centuries Men interned in concentration camps severely tortured and women especially women part of this unpleasant spoil We must then build a society that is able not to forget and not to think that the words of solidarity and compassion are enough when there is a war we must intervene to end and finish the laments of physical and psychological suffering History must be feared and respected It is like when I request that the National Day be established out of respect in memory of the victims of the war rapes of 1943 1944 better known with a name that although annoying is historical and real that is the Moroccans In the face of the rapes of more than 60,000 women men and children of an Italian people the Ciociano people my people in front of the offensive titled in France of squares and streets to goumiers soldiers framed in the corps expéditionnaire français an Italie CEF under General Juin 's command we must assert the memory and the claim of apology without concern whether or not the thought and feeling of oltralpe are impacted Mr President I would like to stress that we do not recognise this day as required by the draft Law 2281 of 2021 which means that we will also speak in this House today by denying and offending history and reality It is not a challenge or the pride of a people which is certainly not desired but the recognition of reality respect for suffering and memory an indelible memory also thanks to the exceptional interpretation of the sublime Sophia Loren in the film La Ciociara And it is in schools that the history and consequences of war must be taught The strength of peace and the cruelty of war must be understood in schools It is necessary to study history in order not to forget Today we try to explain to our children the story of the invasion in Ukraine the evils of a conquering people on a conquered one Let us make it clear how much suffering and violence on the bodies and life of a people can bring war The League will vote in favour of the motion hoping that the Commission responsible for drawing up a draft crime code will not be an instrument of only discussion and participation and hoping that the International Criminal Court will act quickly and above all sharply"
"RUFA L SP PSd Az Mr President the League votes in favour of the bill of delegation to the Government on the code of public contracts and it is also the case not to delay in order to avoid possible European infringement procedures However these are the aims that must make us rush towards the favorable vote considering that it is deburocratic simplifies rationalizes optimizes and then we proceed to close a path of completion of planning and resolution since long started We in the League have structured principles and criteria such as as Mr Corti has already said avoiding gold plating a qualification of contracting stations and active staff the participation of small and medium sized enterprises especially local ones in unpacked contracts and also in forms of public private partnership priority is given to Italian materials and investments in green and digital technology It is also expected that prices will be revised especially now that the costs of energy and fuels are conditional on the value of revenue It is also envisaged to include specific social clauses as well as insurance policies for internal personnel in the design to be carried out by the administration there is the rationalization of sanctioning and rewarding mechanisms as well as the reduction of the tendering times and the conclusion of the contract then there are appropriate timings also for the application of the minimum environmental criteria There are specific qualitative and social criteria for catering A call for tenders with award to the most expensive offer sometimes also means better product and savings over time as we have considered in school canteens where food teaching so a higher cost has become necessary as evidenced by the growing problem of child obesity in schools The League with a series of agendas also wanted to enhance the experience of technical directors and also required an Italian digital construction platform The aim is therefore to accelerate stimulate simplify and optimise the entire public contract chain reducing rules problems and time to address not only the PNRR but also the smallest municipal ban With clear rules there will be fewer disputes fewer appeals more confidence and savings for the State and thus more attractiveness for foreign countries will also be achieved in fact the structural and managerial advantages of investments pass through clear and therefore fast public contracts Today the League is in the government for businesses for entrepreneurs for professionals for workers and for those who have already worked Our task is to simplify and allow everyone to participate but it is the meritocracy that is at the root of these intentions In addition to certain rules I believe that we must have the concept of respect for doing and hunger in the broad sense that is the hunger to grow the hunger for work and the hunger to become protagonists in Italy With certain rules we will be able to stimulate businesses entrepreneurs and above all workers Then there is the sense of duty At times great conquests lead to unexpected or unwanted consequences and some achievements in social and civil rights have had a devastating effect on duty Today we live in the age of rights fixed positions guaranteed wages screaming and demanding That is what Marchionne said who did not even know the income of citizenship at the time who concluded that rights are sacred and must be protected but if we continue to live on rights alone we will die This is our task therefore awaken from this moment of anesthesia especially those young people who expect only the income of citizenship and who still live voluntarily on the shoulders of their parents The will of the League is also to lighten the enterprises from debitorial folders that for the State are spent and for the enterprises only impediment impediment to open a current account to work and to dream of being able to realize enterprise To facilitate this freedom we need a fiscal peace and a new breakdown of the records The League has repeatedly recalled that in 2020 and 2022 at least 530,000 taxpayers have failed to pay respecting the installment plan granted by the tax while there are 15 million Italians with at least one pending debitory folder although 80 of these are under 1,000 euros Why then be bitter On the other hand the 0.2 that exceeds 100,000 euros was controlled The State we must give tranquillity and be an accomplice to those who invest in the enterprise and not tartaxare and seek at all costs tricks to fine It is the enterprises that give future to the families and despite difficulties they never back down It is news of yesterday that Diego and Matteo of Guidizzolo owners of a metal company aware of the expensive bills fuel and food costs have donated a bonus expense to their 17 employees accompanied by the phrase We want to thank you This is the Italian company If the League were to leave the Government some parties would complete what today with us can only dream namely the taxation of those goods that by their own sacrifice every man builds for his own family that is to say the house and the savings With regard to the measure the League wants salaries adapted to the cost of living and attention to changing contracts today higher than the minimum wage assumed We want to support businesses and we consider it mortifying to those who work a citizenship income that is now inappropriate for most people It is to be reviewed and instead it is necessary to voucher or in any case tools of entry to work safe guaranteed and fast as in the world of agriculture and tourism especially at this time The League is always there when it is necessary to shake the consciences of those who passively wait for work and when it is necessary to guarantee certainties to those who want to work That is why we are also in favour of this measure today"
THE PIETRA FdI Mr President Mr Senator allow me first of all to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the work we have done and in particular Mr Vallardi for the sensitivity shown in wanting to involve the opposition in the drafting of a joint document to which we have joined firmly It could only be otherwise because when we talk about national interest and the defence of national interest we have never failed our support and our contribution The defence of our agri -food industry also corresponds to the defence of national interest not only from the economic point of view for the great value that the sector represents for national GDP but also because our agri-food is the result not only of the entrepreneurial capacity of many farmers farmers and processors but also of our culture and our traditions I would also like to thank the Undersecretary Centinario and Minister Patuanelli who is not present for the commitment they are showing and for the efforts they are making both at national and European level to defend our Made in Italy Allow me Mr Undersecretary also to stigmatize the fact that I do not remember and do not revisit the same commitment from the rest of the Government or from one part of it You see Mr. Undersecretary the defence of agro food also goes through economic policies of support and enhancement of the sector Unfortunately I say we cannot flag the fact that in the last budget law the resources for agriculture have doubled compared to the previous law when in absolute terms on a maneuver of more than 30 billion we can only reach a few hundred million as direct resources for the sector of course I am talking about direct resources It can not be said that it is believed in the sector if the PNRR invests in agriculture just over 6 7 billion on a Plan of about 300 billion Not only is there little economic attention but I am also thinking of the banking system where our farmers fishermen and farmers find enormous obstacles to access to credit In summary Undersecretary despite his commitment and despite the commitment of the Minister we do not think that the Government as a whole invests substantially in this sector which represents almost a quarter of national GDP So Mr Undersecretary I do not even see a foreign policy which is aimed at protecting national interests and protecting the sector I am thinking for example of fishing I would like to give an example to everyone where there is no strong policy to protect our fishermen and defend our seas I am thinking of relations with the countries of North Africa and with the countries of the Adriatic On the contrary we often represent in this sector the soft belly of a Europe that has left the fishing sector in the Mediterranean to its fate while defending ocean fishing by the sword And I could go further Instead we come to the subject of the motion I would like to stress how the way in which we have to deal with the Farm to Fork strategy that is pragmatically has been highlighted without letting ourselves go to often ideological environmentalist enthusiasms I say this in particular to those colleagues who are dealing with the environmental issue but do not have a practical view of the problem We have written this clearly reporting important studies such as that of the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the Joint Research Centre which warn of the danger that a farm to fork driven strategy can paradoxically create negative effects for our economy The figures are clear a substantial reduction in European agricultural production from 7 to 12 depending on the extent of the application of these strategies an increase in consumer prices by about 17 a substantial decrease in production and a large increase in costs which will put our farms in difficulty an increase in imports from non-EU countries where controls are very low as we know then creating those conditions in the rest of the world such as deforestation and an increase in mass production with even greater use of chemistry which we are trying to curb here in Europe Some taxes such as the 10 allocation of agricultural land to biodiversity must also be re-discussed and analysed on the basis of cost and benefit principles This provision in my view is even more damaging to our national agriculture which apart from specific geographical situations does not have a large amount of land available The morphology of most of the national territory already has green corridors and areas for biodiversity in itself and we cannot therefore apply this provision in a linear way I am thinking of the many hilly areas where there are numerous crops where the land is used up to the last meter and where moreover there are already uncultivated natural areas that can allow the passage or the protection of biodiversity I am thinking of the imposition of 25 increase in agricultural land for organic farming Great purpose but we have a duty to safeguard the quality of food as well as to guarantee everyone the possibility of feeding on healthy and guaranteed products We know that organic production substantially reduces the yield of the land consequently there will be an increase in costs I personally believe that we cannot create such an agriculture that we then have to divide between A series and B series consumers i.e. consumers who can afford expensive products compared to consumers forced to feed on poor quality food from other countries On this too we will have to reflect and not accept impositions that do not take into account the specific characteristics of Italy where organic or not there is a high quality of our agricultural products The desire to impose the nutrition labelling system Secretary of State aims at the type approval of products without taking into account their true contribution to an overall food system So much has already been said about this and many of my colleagues have well explained what it means which is why I will not repeat myself However I would like to point out that it is important for us to use the nutrinform battery system which in contrast to the nourishing score can actually give serious information to the consumer in order to evaluate the purchase of a particular product according to their food needs That is why we wanted to insist that the mechanism should include a commitment to pursue initiatives to promote this type of labelling and also to introduce new testing systems including through the creation of specific apps to have more data and to be more convincing towards the European community I also stress the importance of point 5 which few have highlighted where the Union is urged to adopt specific clauses to prevent imports of products that do not reflect the criteria of environmental economic and social sustainability an altar unfortunately on which we are paradoxically sacrificing so many of our companies We 've been talking about civilization duties for a long time but we 're not listening Much more could be said Mr Undersecretary but I would like to invite you if you give me a moment of attention to pay great attention to asking for the full support of the whole Government of the risk that we are running inherent in this system of the formal emergency that economic and commercial policies are applied in Europe as well as unfair even hostile and aggressive especially with regard to us that they are going to alter the competition of the market by favouring some economies and penalising others moreover in clear contradiction with the founding aims of the Union itself On this point in defence of national interests of our agriculture and of our agri-food you will always find us ready For these reasons I announce the vote in favour of the Brothers of Italy Group
THE PIETRA FdI Mr President today finally ends the obstacle course of this measure which with the fourth reading in the Senate we can say that it will be finally adopted I say this because it is important and also to emphasize listening to the speeches of so many colleagues as is highlighted by the importance of agriculture but I am addressing the Government and my colleagues in the majority beyond the words and all the compliments we give to our farmers and our farmers it would be appropriate to be even more concrete because basically concreteness is also measured with how much resources the Government makes available to agriculture Unfortunately in the various measures that we have seen from the budget law to the PNRR these resources are not adequate neither at the level of this sector which is defined as primary but which is also fundamental for our economy The draft law that we are finally going to approve at the fourth reading in a definitive way is certainly an important step a framework law in fact that puts order to the organic production sector in our nation because as has already been pointed out and as we have said so many times in the various explanations of vote and in the various interventions that we have done also in the previous readings it is an important sector for Italian agriculture as it is for the whole of Europe There was therefore a need to put black on white and to codify a whole series of issues in order to allow our companies to work quietly There are important aspects that have been mentioned the organic brand the constitution of the districts the resources for promotion but I would like to invite my colleagues to give a little thought together with me Be careful not to pursue false myths as well By this I mean that we certainly cannot think of concentrating agriculture entirely on the organic sector because as we know organic farming has a much lower yield than the traditional one which should instead be encouraged through investment and research in order to enable it being in turn an important sector to produce enough food to feed our population The world population is approaching in the coming years the nine billion people who must be fed and I do not think it is fair to them nor to our fellow citizens because I have heard many of my colleagues say that this is an important niche that there are people who are willing to spend I believe that this is true but I think it is equally important to ensure that all citizens are able to feed properly because we cannot however think that we then have A and B series citizens who on the basis of their economic possibilities can feed better or worse than others This is a very important social reasoning which is particularly close to my heart It is therefore good that this bill has regularised the whole sector but let us be careful about these aspects Today unfortunately the situation that has erupted in Ukraine the war that some of you have already mentioned leads us to a reflection regarding the food supply of our country because there is not only an energy problem but we also have one that we will have to face and on which we will have to confront with regard to food self sufficiency Today about 25 of the durum wheat we import comes from Ukraine and Russia you understand that this together with the agricultural policies of Canada the United States and Australia also has a heavy impact on costs but basically it must lead us to reflect on what we are doing in our country to achieve self sufficiency in food at least in certain sectors Unfortunately we do not have it in any area but there is no national strategic plan for food security today On this we should confront each other and we must invest resources and certainly have a vision all united for the next few years Having said that I would also like to make clear some of the things that have happened in the course of this provision Moreover I am pleased that Senator Cattaneo has accepted the rewordings proposed by the Government because from here too a unanimous act and a commitment are born so that the nuances that still remain in the bill can be corrected As Brothers of Italy we have always supported its approval as I told you because the sector certainly needs it However we have always fought the equalization that exists within the law between biodynamic and biological so much so that at second reading we had proposed in the Committee on Agriculture amendments for the repeal of paragraph 3 of Article 1 which were rejected However we agreed with all the other group leaders that we would not have tabled amendments in this House to facilitate the process of the measure On that occasion Senator Cattaneo tabled amendments on which we in line with the line we had in the Commission voted in favour The measure went to the Chamber and an amendment was made to article 1 but unfortunately as has already been pointed out to article 5 which concerns the technical table of the Ministry for Organic and to article 8 which concerns the national plan has still remained the reference to biodynamics I want to hope that it is a forgetfulness of a non-political character but a drafting error the correction of which was prevented by the haste for the approval of the House and for the fourth reading in the Senate I do n't want to think that it 's a way to get the biodynamics out of the front door and then bring them back in the window by involving a representative of this category at the technical table and also recognize it within the national plan for the resources that need to be distributed As I said I am pleased that Senator Cattaneo presented this agenda and accepted the rewordings because it is clear that there is a clear commitment from the Government to ensure that we can vote on the timely amendments to Article 5 and Article 8 of the law which will be tabled in the next steps I will not repeat so many things that have been said partly because we have repeatedly spoken about this subject I therefore announce the vote in favour of the Brothers of Italy Group
THE PIETRA FdI Mr President Members of the Government ladies and gentlemen I cannot hide the satisfaction of the debate today in this House of a draft law at my first signature which concerns a demonstration strongly linked to the territory for which I also have the honour to speak in an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group we are talking about the amendment to Article 2 of Law No 238 of 20 December 2012 for the support and enhancement of the Pistoia Blues Festival I would like to express satisfaction and gratitude to the entire 7th Senate Commission for its sensitivity in addressing this issue which certainly opens up further reflection on the countless events that constitute a huge national cultural and musical heritage and that if put on the net can represent a huge flywheel not only cultural but also economic and employment and a further source of development for each individual territory Allow me to thank my colleagues Mr Iannone and Mr Barbaro who have done an excellent job even in an amending phase in order to support the process of the bill I would also like to thank the rapporteur Senator Cangini who with sensitivity and an institutional sense managed the work of the Commission and also a special thanks to the President of the Commission Senator Nencini who took the bill to heart so much that he wanted to sign it in turn demonstrating the importance of an event that with its forty years of activity has not only national value but also international value for the musical quality it expresses Last but not least I would like to thank my fellow senators who have signed the bill with me from my colleague Iannone to Senator Bishops from Senator Masini to Undersecretary Bini to Senator Ferrara and last but not least to my colleagues Mallegni and Floris who also added their signature to the measure demonstrating the political transversality that supported this initiative I would also like to point out that at this particularly difficult time it is important to pay attention also to seemingly more marginal aspects but they represent instead a signal of normality and attention to a world that can indeed it is be a tool of communication between peoples The Pistoia Blues Festival was founded in 1980 and its forty year long parable has led him to be the most important blues festival in Europe and one of the first in the world From the first edition to today it has represented a point of reference for the great international artists in Italy combining quality and musical research with the specificity of the territory and in particular the landscape and the typical tourist reception of the Tuscany Region of which to date is the music festival with the longest and most significant history From the first edition to today the main aims of this event have always been two to promote the territory Pistoia Tuscany and Italy as an ideal location for great international music to promote blues music as an extraordinary cultural heritage which has generated in its ramifications and developments all contemporary music The Pistoia Blues has been characterized so far by an extraordinary continuity as I said that has made it for forty years leading protagonist in the national panorama of festivals All editions have presented star casts and over the years nothing has been lost compared to its national and international standing thus remaining a reference point for the public for the press for the established artists and for the emerging ones The festival has therefore promoted for forty years without interruption the territory tourism and the Italian lifestyle through concerts and meetings all connected to the world of blues but above all through its direct language and rich in humanity which recalls values such as respect brotherhood and coexistence Never as important as this message is now In addition to this it is important to point out that Pistoia Blues carries out training and scouting activities aimed at young generations of artists For this purpose in fact it was born at the beginning of the nineties Goal BluesIn in which are selected every year the emerging musicians who will participate in the next edition of Pistoia Blues It represents a prestigious goal for many musicians who want to make their passion and talent a profession Goal BluesIn was born in 1993 alongside the event therefore to enhance the new Italian talents in the music field and is one of the stable and priority activities of the event with free registration it counts every year between 500 and 600 admissions and chooses the winners who will play on the main stage of the festival one for each geographical area of Italy Centro South and North through live selections that take place in the network of local members of the initiative Participating in the Pistoia Blues with Goal BluesIn is a real showcase that in addition to offering the opportunity to play on a prestigious stage in front of a large audience presents the winning artists to a selected representation of organizers and operators of the Italian and European music sector guests of the festival The winners of the BluesIn Objective also have the opportunity to be included in the compilation dedicated to the Pistoia Blues Generation Festival There is therefore a special focus on young people It is a real snapshot of new rock and blues talents of the Italian scene with a selection of the best and most representative bands that have participated in the competition of recent years an opportunity I repeat unrepeatable for young people This legislative measure I shall conclude Mr President means making a further qualitative leap in the organizational arrangements and consolidating the event aimed at achieving a renewed capacity for planning and prospects on the one hand it enhances the historical and cultural heritage that the festival has represented on the other hand it allows the event to extend its activities and to involve other players in the national and international context to enhance the experience and to expand the promotional activities It represents an acknowledgment not only to a great event but to an entire community that in forty years has narrowed itself around it becoming a whole one during not only the days of July but all the year round when the whole city becomes a great stage with its squares its alleys of the historic center and the many locals that welcome the artists allowing an atmosphere to breathe thanks to the many initiatives that involve everyone For these reasons and for many others that time does not allow me to explain in detail I declare the positive and convinced vote of the Brothers of Italy Group and my personal satisfaction I thank the Senate Assembly
"THE PIETRA FdI Mr President I would like to bring to the attention of the House the content of this amendment and to make the Government well appreciate the opinion it has expressed because I do not believe that this proposal can be expressed against it Amendment 20,200 aims to protect the fundamental values of the Italian transfusion system and explicitly provides that blood collection should be carried out exclusively by unpaid and unpaid donors I think this is a battle of civilization The Italian transfusion system is an excellence and must be protected blood plasma and plasma derivatives are themes not known to the public but fundamental for the maintenance of the National Health System and for the health of many patients It is therefore the task of politics and this House to safeguard and defend this model which is based on two principles gratuitousness and voluntaryness I would like to highlight a figure that emerged from the annual research of the Italian Blood Volunteers Association AVIS The pandemic and the emergency situation in our country have generated a boost to donation once again therefore the Italian system confirms itself as a virtuous model in the consolidation and expansion of the audience of donors We must therefore work on structural interventions that increase the volume of blood donors not with premiums but with active policies such as increasing the number of health workers extending the opening hours of the centres the inclusion of blood collection centres in community homes and the reorganization and renewal of plasma storage and separation machinery The collection of blood therefore excludes and must exclude at the origin any kind of economic and financial assessment Commercializing one 's own blood is tantamount to commercializing organs or any other part of the body The considerations are in the deepest ethics of mankind there is a bulwark made up precisely of gratuitousness and voluntariness this amendment asks this to the Assembly which once passed can open the way to a thousand other drifts and considerations The Italian model I repeat and finish shows that self sufficiency can be achieved through a totally free collection system Government and Parliament must work together to support plasma collection with policies necessary to achieve self sufficiency in research not by marketing plasma Defending the Italian transfusion system is the only way to protect the National Health System lowering as much as possible the public cost of plasma for purchasing from abroad Today we begin with a small step drawing on the deepest morale and tomorrow we can decide to buy or sell any part of our body With this amendment Brothers of Italy stands as defender of this bulwark of civilization Blood is not an economic tool and you do not want to open up to easily predictable drifts I still ask the House and the Government to review their position on this amendment to give a favourable opinion and to vote in favour"
"THE PIETRA FdI Mr President members of the Government fellow senators we are at the third reading of this measure of popular initiative which leads us to the amendment of Article 119 of the Constitution including a very important concept the right of all citizens living on the islands to have the same possibilities and conditions of life as citizens living on the Continent I can only basically reiterate what we said at the first reading in this House in November 2021 This is an important act which recognizes to these citizens the difficulty of living in these territories albeit beautiful I therefore think that the measure under discussion can in fact establish the equal rights they must have such as education health and above all the right to carry out their work and life as other citizens We know that there are still strong elements of substantial discrimination against the communities of the islands but we must also stress that there are different conditions within these island communities I am referring to those who live in the major islands such as Sicily and Sardinia compared to the citizens who live in the smaller islands We know what are the most frequently proposed problems which I think are well known to all transport water supply health care education housing conditions and waste disposal hydrogeological disruption and even population desertification just to mention the most striking If therefore this process of desertification of our islands is to be stopped I am referring in particular to the smaller ones but nevertheless there are difficulties especially for young people even for the larger islands we must implement direct concrete measures In this respect I wonder for example what happened to the framework law on islands which was adopted in the Commission and which I still do not think has been implemented in practice Therefore the amendment to Article 119 of the Constitution certainly goes in this direction but we must be effective in drawing up administrative acts that help all citizens living in these islands and therefore prepare concrete actions to relaunch the economy This ladies and gentlemen must not be considered a privilege for these citizens but the only remedy to compensate for the difficulties of those living in the islands where production costs are much higher than in the rest of Europe because of the lack of infrastructure therefore within these territories an infrastructure design plan must also be implemented I would also like to reiterate one aspect that I mentioned earlier I believe that intellectual honesty must be shown that within the insularity there are differences between those who live on the two major islands I have heard my colleagues from Sardinia and Sicily talking with emphasis about this but we must also think about those who live in the smaller islands We are talking about about about 150,000 inhabitants scattered in about 40 islands because this is the geographical configuration of our nation From this point of view we must have further consideration because very often in the smaller islands there is also a lack of essential services schools hospitals first aid and drinking water networks I believe that also thanks to this measure perhaps there will be greater attention but it must be put into concrete actions with investments and resources that go in these directions Having said that Mr President I am voting in favour of the Group of Brothers of Italy"
Minister we have listened to your report so many numbers so many resources but the truth is that our agriculture is dry There is no water and we do not have the opportunity to distribute even the little water that exists in the most economical way possible to our farmers I say this to you Minister you have made a point which unfortunately as we may recall has been repeated many times now I remind you of the various water crises that there have been serious drought crises 1997 2002 2012 and 2017 which was the worst Some 5 billion damage has been estimated for these crises almost half due to the 2017 crisis and all the time politics questions has to intervene and the so called drought decrees come out The draft came out almost a month ago then there was some rain and it disappeared This is not the right attitude that politics must have There are plans and projects but we should try to apply them Let me give you some examples but not before a brief note In the draft decree that has circulated we do not know if it is the definitive one because we are now in such a chaos for which it is objectively difficult to make any kind of prediction there was also reference to a Commissioner whom you mentioned in your reasoning The Commissioner is a useful figure if he has the opportunity to operate but that is not enough A national plan is also needed to identify the water needs the structures necessary for the country system and within a national framework the specificities of each individual territory Indeed as you know almost 90 of national water consumption is absorbed by agriculture industry and electricity production Only 10 percent is about drinking water on which I will make a small note later In order to do this the Commissioner who must have the power to act and overcome all the various levels of governance which are so many at national level and which do not allow a precise framework to be found but there must also be this plan which we do not see today As I have already said the Commissioner must really have the powers to act I hope this is not a Commissioner like the one provided for in the decree on African swine fever since we have solved absolutely nothing What to do You Minister mentioned the consortia and you are right However I would remind you that more than a year ago the Agriculture and Food Production Commission of the Senate approved an assigned deal that made a very clear picture of the situation of reclamation and irrigation consortia You said in some cases that you did n't find the design ability but already in that assigned deal and in that resolution we had written that these problems were there Why not also look at the work being done This is the fundamental fact never look at it I would have liked to give some more thought but time is tyrant and it is ending The plans are there there are pond plans and there might be the possibility to stimulate the recovery of city waste water with purifiers Let 's think of some cities ruled by the center left for over seventy years I give you the punctual example of Pistoia where the center right came to power after seventy five years where there are still neighborhoods that are not connected to the sewers and do not have drinking water and where wells are used That is what we must do True 50 percent of the pipes lose but refer to 10 percent of the water used We must adopt a plan on which to act and ensure that at last there are not only speeches but also real and effective works
Mr President I will probably take even less minutes than I have been given because there are not so many things to say Finally we are bringing an extremely interesting subject to the House Beekeeping is an economic sector not very important compared to the whole Italian agri -food system There is talk at European level of a few billion as regards trade in this product as we know the main product is honey but derived from this there are also many other products and by products that serve not only for food but also for other sectors such as cosmetics Beyond the aspect of beekeeping it is important to bring a topic to the House today to be put to the public 's attention and I do not think it escapes my colleagues who are here now and who speaking of bees are filling this room with a pleasant buzz because they are not careful the fact that this small insect along with many other pollinating insects is the driving force behind agriculture Through these insects in fact we manage to have agricultural production Five motions were presented starting from one signed by colleagues of the League and presented in May 2021 We as the Brothers of Italy Group have also tabled a motion which is highlighted in relation to the others on a number of points that I would like to stress The first of all is that which calls on the government to commit itself to reducing the VAT rate from 22 to 10 for beekeeping equipment It is a sector that as I said before has a low economic impact but that still requires important investments to those who want to devote to this activity and income as well as in many other sectors is certainly not profitable The second point is important we expect real and concrete compensation with regard to income support even in cases of damage to production caused by climate change which very often lead to zeroing these farms so much so that if until recently the bees in some way gave a nourishment or maintenance to man very often because of climate change it is man himself who must feed these animals who are at risk of extinction Of course even here the problem is not only climate change but sometimes also the indiscriminate use of certain pesticides which do not help the survival of these insects In this case too we try to urge important commitments such as education within schools but above all to encourage the actions of the Municipalities so much so that with the agricultural department of Brothers of Italy directed by my colleague De Carlo in recent months we have made a motion in all the Municipalities in which this problem was highlighted trying to urge them to take action to defend these animals This is what is basically proposed in the motions We could then talk about unfair competition especially from China which creates products with syrup But what I wanted to highlight and stigmatize Mr President is that unfortunately we have missed an opportunity in the Committee on Agriculture Last Friday I urged the Commission because beyond the motions it had made an act of direction a business assigned by the Presidency which we all voted together The whole of the Agriculture Commission had voted on the document I am sorry that Senator Taricco whom I highly esteem has proposed as a single motion of the PD exactly and literally with a copy and paste all the document that we had unanimously approved and that was the result of the work of all the Commissioners and all the political groups It is certainly a behavior to be stigmatized because it is incorrect Also because I had this thing publicly
Mr President a lot has already been said I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their speeches and for the work they have done in the Commission which certainly tried to sew the various sensitivities which as President Vallardi also said emerged during the debate As Senator Biti said the farmers asked us to intervene immediately I would like to make a comment on this because from the first report about the presence of African swine fever in an animal found dead at the enactment of the decree law that we are discussing today it has been two months from that 17 February it has passed another month in three months therefore we have only succeeded I say it not to make controversy but because it must be the object of reflection to activate the bureaucracy and it has been done the simplest thing that is to say to establish to do nothing everything has been blocked all the hunting activities all the play and work activities in the woods I say this Mr President because there is very likely something to be reviewed throughout the legislative system which regulates the hunting aspects in Italy It seems to me that Mr Vallardi and Mr Bergesio have also referred to this I 'd like to make a simple note Many documents have already been presented in the direction of amending Italian legislation on the containment of wildlife One in particular is a report that the Agriculture Commission voted unanimously only four were abstention votes but all the others were positive This report which concerned a deal on wildlife damage was voted on on 30 June last year Mr President allow me to make these remarks That report referred to many species of animals which are in fact a damage to agriculture but in particular the wild boar The wild boar is spoken of as a particularly overcrowded and overestimated species There is an excessive amount of animals compared to the sustainability of the territory which poses many problems I briefly leave the problem of road safety aside because most of the accidents that occur and unfortunately victims are also caused by these people I leave aside the damage to agriculture the destruction of crops That is what was said in that report These are a few lines which I would like to read to remind myself but also to the House Among the implications that make it necessary and urgent to intervene on the excessive proliferation of the species are the health risks that the excessive spread of the boar can exert towards the livestock sector The disproportionate number of wild boars exponentially increases the risk of introduction of certain diseases such as African swine fever PSA which can create important health risks for the subsequent spread of pathogens and then continues We had written this and approved it in the Commission on 30 June last year Mr President I should also like to say to my fellow senators perhaps a little distracted that there were about twenty points in that report which gave clear indications to the government on how to try to combat the spread Let me mention a few to establish a sustainable control plan for the wild boar species to rethink the approach to the management of wild boar in the territory aiming at effective prevention to activate in order to enact effective rules that fill legislative gaps to amend Law No 157 of 1992 Mr President I am saying all this because when dealing with situations in a demagogic way then instead of preventing them we are forced to deal with emergencies as we are now We have repeatedly requested at the meeting of the Leaders in the Commission that we be able to bring this document to the House but we have always found obstructionism particularly on the part of some forces that face the problem in a demagogic way I am referring to the Mixed Group and Senator De Petris who have always opposed bringing the measure to the House for her debate I also wonder who Senator De Petris represents because within the Mixed Group there are completely different positions on the subject I am thinking for example of Senators Abbot and Fattori who have signed and signed this document yet their Leader in the Commission has always opposed it Here too therefore there is a matter to be clarified In the same way I say very clearly that the same Movimento 5 Stars had opposed the discussion of the document Even the Democratic Party has not had a very strong attitude from time to time indeed it was very lukewarm I say this because if this measure had passed through this House and had been able to debate it and approve it surely with some changes perhaps we would have dealt with this situation differently today The other day in the Health Commission at the end of the sitting the President of the Commission asked me why the regions despite the decree have not yet implemented any prevention plan It is simple the regulatory system is confused and does not allow institutions to operate Mr President I believe that in this House there is certainly a strong political responsibility for some forces at this moment in the majority which with their pre-emptive environmentalist and animalist attitude are questioning the whole livestock supply chain which corresponds to 1.5 points of national GDP for livestock only If we expand the debate on food processing and food processing we are talking about tens of thousands of jobs and billions of economies that we might see blurred Even today only on the news that there is African swine fever in Italy fortunately for now in that restricted area many foreign nations have blocked imports from Italy This is what we are talking about and not about boars who are seen walking through the streets of Rome or other cities We need to take action on this As to the merits of the provision the decree was born deflated The Commissioner was only a coordinator and had no means powers and resources to put in place decisive timely and fast action I appreciate the work done by our rapporteurs because in some way some resources have finally arrived but we are talking about EUR 10 million We are investing EUR 10 million in a supply chain worth billions More attention had to be paid to the fact that 10 million euros even if well come because as they say old husband better than nothing are too few You have to have the conscience to invest Now we want to make fences but how long will it take to make it 260 kilometers In these weeks the wild boar population will certainly become five or six times higher than the present one and therefore at that point there will be further pressure to the outside You have to be aware of what you do If we do not take strong and targeted actions for immediate eradication within the red zone trying to reduce the amount of those grits which are around not only the red zone but throughout Italy it is proved that the large number of wild boars brings in fact this disease we will not be able to solve the problem I repeat that when we face such problems we must do it with our feet on the ground in a concrete way and not with the ideological forms that very often unfortunately so many movements of the majority are adopting
Mr President it does not appear to me that they have been absorbed We have tabled reworded amendments as requested by the Commission with a favourable opinion But I 'm sticking
THE PIETRA FdI Mr President Mr Senator ladies and gentlemen it is undeniable that we are experiencing a particularly complex moment which for many reasons has a negative impact on the agricultural system and beyond A conflict is taking place on the European territory between Ukraine and Russia an economic situation already dramatic in itself because of the pandemic has struck us dramatically in recent years in terms of health with negative consequences also on the productive sector climate change causes increasingly extreme events In this context rules laws and directives are inserted at different times at times when normality if we want to call it so could allow us to make choices that unfortunately today we must have the courage and I add the wisdom to change so as not to make the situation even worse The act under discussion goes in this direction Basically we ask the government to postpone the entry into force of the rules for the implementation of the ecological outflow of watercourses in place of the minimum vital outflow which I want to emphasize still remains in force I do not retrace the administrative history of the various provisions I merely point out that in this context this act is indispensable in order not to further preclude the withdrawal of water We must give priority and have responsibility Let it be clear that we care about the environment and the ecosystem of the waterways so much so that the rules of the vital minimum runoff are there and remain but today we have to deal with a changed situation We therefore need to understand the reasons for this request and this act We have said that the conjunction of certain situations is creating a perfect storm for the management of the national water system The pandemic has created many problems blocking for two years the majority of ordinary and extraordinary interventions Because of the health regulations many offices have been closed or with reduced staff design suspended everything slowed down to properly focus on the health emergency But now we have to make up for lost time The Russian aggression against Ukraine has led to an exponential increase in the costs of energy and raw materials The sanctions have also caused a negative impact on our companies to which we must try to give concrete answers Today Europe realises that there is no food sovereignty Italy is aware of how dependent it is on imports so it has rightly decided to increase the cultivated hectares and for this reason more water is needed Climate change is now characterized by extraordinary and sudden events sometimes with excessive rainfall sometimes with prolonged drought periods such as what we are currently experiencing with months of drought and a winter period that has seen little snowfall and that in view of the forecasts will continue with a summer with scarce rainfall making the situation even worse In all this the entry into force of the ecological outflow is involved a further regulatory criticality that must be postponed at the moment In the Commission we have understood the consequences of the entry into force of this principle and after having audited in just over two months many subjects we have drafted this document to be submitted to the Assembly 's opinion to engage the Government in some actions to be carried out to deepen the impact of the entry into force of the rules of ecological outflow but essentially to extend by two years from the entry into force of these rules and to make further investigation into this matter also with a view to the problems described above in order to make it all more sustainable Of course the management of water resources which invest different sectors from agricultural irrigation to civil use from artisan industrial use to the production of electricity I remember that in recent months the production of hydropower has dropped by 50 because of the drought in place and not least the protection of the environment cannot be based only on the problem of the subject matter of this document but should have a wider spectrum of action with a direction cabin that can better coordinate all the actors involved in the management of water resources from the regions to the authorities of the basin from the territorial areas to the municipalities from the societies owners of the networks to the consortia Mr President allow me to make a reflection which concerns in particular the parliamentary work and the management of the same by the Government which is not careful I use an understatement not only to the opposition 's proposals but to the work of the same Commissions In October 2020 in the Committee on Agriculture we unanimously approved if I am not mistaken the report on the deal allocated to problems relating to reclamation and irrigation consortia and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur at the time Senator Trentacoste for the work he has done In that report the Government committed itself to several points and I quote the most important ones the revival of the strategic role of the reclamation and irrigation consortia in the management and defence of the territory and its resources in the contrast to the hydrogeological risk and in the support to the national agriculture a revision and strengthening of the model of government of the consortia that consolidates the role of the farmer and the direct beneficiaries of the consort activities the adoption of measures aimed at the strengthening of the National Plan invaded in order to complete the work of execution of the already partially realized works to prepare the study of a plan of dredging of the invades and of care of the watercourses that allows to recover the volume of water collection All actions that if put on the field today would have allowed us to tackle the water problem certainly with greater tranquility All this could not be done that report did not come to this House and so we could not give these guidelines that would have been fundamental today to solve the problem of water Similarly to make a further point if the agricultural damage deal which was approved in the Commission had been brought to the Chamber perhaps the SAP emergency could have been dealt with differently President politics I say this to the representative of the government must also prevent and not only deal with emergencies when they can be foreseen I say this also in order to stigmatize how this heterogeneous majority renounces to discuss measures not only of common sense but also necessary in order to ensure the precarious balance between the various political forces that make up it As always we as Brothers of Italy make our contribution and guarantee our support for all those measures that we consider useful and necessary for the nation For all these reasons I announce as already expressed in the Commission the positive vote of the Brothers of Italy Group
THE PIETRA FdI Mr President I will be very brief but I would at least like to have time to explain the reasons why the Brothers of Italy abstained on certain articles I immediately declare that we will vote in favour of this measure and give it our responsibility because it is a text that can certainly make a positive contribution to our farmers and because small local produce can represent an increase in income that can certainly help those farmers farmers and fishermen in disadvantaged areas However I must also say that a common sense provision had come out of the Senate while the changes that have been made to the House have in fact distorted the provision in its essential foundations I am thinking of the amendment of point a of paragraph 1 of Article 1 which strictly binds to compliance with the sanitary regulations and controls I am thinking of the deletion of point b of the same paragraph in which the principle of marginality is deleted That is why we voted in favour of abstaining Another key element is the deletion of paragraphs 3 4 and 5 of Article 4 on the PPL mark It was a way of helping farmers to characterize their product both direct and processing and also of adding value to consumers Finally I would like to stress the further concern raised by the amendment to Article 7 where many paragraphs have been abolished which actually represented the way to lower this law within the local productive realities which for centuries have been the place of the production of many of our articles In conclusion I repeat the positive vote of the Group of Brothers of Italy assuming that it is still preferable to have an instrument albeit imperfect as this bill comes out to make available to the territories rather than to delay the entry into force of this measure
THE PIETRA FdI Mr President I would like to ask my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture but also those in the centre right and centre left in the 5 Star Movement and in the PD that when we do the hearings in the Commission they should tear their clothes to tell farmers and fishermen to everyone that the price of diesel fuel is high It is killing our supply chains as they can from tomorrow before farmers and fishermen and say that you have actually rejected Amendment 1.10
Bergesio L SP PSd Az Mr President Mr Undersecretary Italian agri-food is synonymous with excellence In 2020 Italy confirmed itself in the first place of the European Union to 27 for added value of agriculture with over 31.4 billion euros ahead of France 30.2 billion and Spain 29 billion Also in 2020 there was an average increase of 9.7 in the consumption of the product symbol of the Mediterranean diet such as extra virgin olive oil fruit vegetables up to pasta Fruit with an increase in purchases of 11 percent is the leader of the expenditure classification in the second place extra virgin olive oil where consumption increases by 9.7 following the high profits recorded by the pasta made with wheat 100 percent made in Italy Remember that the Mediterranean diet has been recognized as an intangible heritage of UNESCO because of its peculiarities based on the balanced consumption of food that belongs to the culture and the millennial tradition of our country which is characterized by its varied heritage of biodiversity It is therefore unjustified to work to put in place systems that should be characterized by the right information to consumers for proper nutrition but that are actually more conditioned by ruthless market logics that are based solely on economic interests I refer explicitly to all these additional labelling systems designed and patented by private agencies and which union bureaucrats would like to impose on all countries regardless of the respect for the traditions and food cultures that have always characterized and made unique the more than 100 European peoples As far as the food regime is concerned this Europe also thinks in a sterile and aseptic way based solely on quotas and measures For example the nourishing score system even if it reaches the consumer in an immediate way providing in a simple way the information required with the use of colors and letters actually bases its judgment on the elaboration of complicated systems based on algorithms that condition the judgment of the consumer relying only on some nutrients such as salt and fats without making a more articulated reasoning based on the right portions and doses to be taken during a food day Hence the paradox of seeing rejected products such as our Parmigiano Reggiano and extra virgin olive oil while at the same time they are promoted carbonated and sweetened drinks this is a real shame This system does n't seem to get stuck in front of anything After meat and cheese now wine is also under attack a drink that has belonged for millennia to the history not only of Italy but of the whole of Europe In fact the ultra processed products and those that can be reworded and built in the laboratory to ensure that the components are all within the palettes established by the algorithm In this way it will be easy for example to get a seasoning with a green nourishing score putting that amount of fat maybe vegetable to give flavor without raising the score too much as well as that little salt that is enough to be within the limit that would trigger the next point a little protein that compensate for that pinch of extra fat and voila the dressing is served This is not the Mediterranean diet With a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil which will have a yellow label an alert signal of the nourishes score instead a salad is seasoned in a healthier and more pleasant way The large organized distribution can amplify the phenomenon and influence the choices The risk is that greener products are promoted as safe to fill the trolleys with food that could not always have optimal quality Ultimately if the nourishing score has been conceived as a tool to combat overweight it is believed that on the contrary it favours an increase in the consumption of ultra- processed foods which will appear green and healthy but are not Moreover it does not focus the attention of the consumer on the necessary portion of food and does not contribute to proper food education since it penalizes better food It is news of these days that France proposes to add a sixth letter the F associated with the black colour to classify the drinks containing alcohol even in small quantities it is very serious if we think that this is due to the fact that in the wine there is a very small amount of alcohol among other things very reduced from 5 to 15 percent maximum which would give it a danger connotation so as to denounce its carcinogenic effects This is a real strategy of terror that is based on increasing the right fears of consumers without entering into the merit of the due differentiations that must be made between the use and the abuse of a food In the light of this set of evidence we consider it of great importance that the national scientific community in particular nutrition experts and those who deal primarily with the issue of obesity intervene in the debate taking place at Community level stressing that on the basis of the evidence available the package front labelling system proposed by the Italian Government called nutinform battery should be considered the most appropriate to increase the nutritional knowledge of the public and consumers and to provide consumers themselves with the information necessary to deal with it with more preparation and therefore probably with a better result the theme of the prevention of overweight and obesity The value of our agriculture the agri-food chain and the Mediterranean diet cannot be sold for reasons that have nothing to do with health and healthy food I quote a phrase that seemed trivial but which today has an unequivocal value in my view Oscar Wilde wrote I can't stand those who do n't take food seriously We in addition to taking it seriously at the table have the task of defending with our nails and teeth our made in Italy because the Italian food supply chain and consumers need it every day The Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Parliamentary Group has firmly brought this motion to the House today together with the Committee on Agriculture I would like to thank President Vallardi and all the members of the Committee on Agriculture Fisheries and Food for together we have built an important and united motion We will vote in favour to reiterate that we will leave nothing unturned to defend our agri-food heritage and our excellence of Made in Italy
"Mr President after Decree Law No 17 of 2022 on energy with which we have allocated EUR 6.7 billion in resources here is an important measure Decree Law No 21 on Ukraine with an initial budget of EUR 3.6 billion and following the Government 's amendment adding an additional EUR 2.3 billion for a total of almost EUR 6 billion This is a measure which contains important measures in addition to the Presidency of the Council there are nine ministries involved to adequately support the Italian system the reduction of oil and petrol prices the reduction of excise duties the fuel bonus for employees the tax credit for companies the social bonus on electricity and gas There are important issues such as the installment of bills the transfer of tax credits wage integration measures to support road haulage agriculture fisheries tourism and all public bodies On the subject of agriculture the measure introduces in Article 19 an important novelty in the field of aid and support to the sector financing the renegotiation or restructuring of agricultural loans an aspect that affects many of the more than 720,000 agricultural enterprises active in our country that will be able to count on an intervention under guarantee up to 5 million euros The fund was refinanced for 20 million euros by Ismea and there was also a shared amendment of the Ministry of Agriculture Food and Forestry Policy that had made available an additional 80 million euros on which however there was no positive feedback from the General Accounting of the State However we have the reasonable certainty reading the drafts that the fund will be refinanced in the aid decree- law already approved in the Council of Ministers for an additional EUR 100 million so as to bring a total guarantee that exceeds almost EUR 2 billion only for the agricultural sector and this becomes important This article aimed at generating greater liquidity for businesses has been made an important modification which comes after years of absurd battles and judgments not always corrected on the subject refunds from fines deriving from milk quotas In Italy in 2021 we imported about 621,000 tons of milk the comparison between production and consumption is at 88 percent We grew up until 2018 it was 78 percent 10 percent more but still 12 percent missing So why despite the growth in this sector which is increasing in quantity and quality are there many farmers still in dispute over the payment of milk quota fines With our amendment to Article 21 which implements the reopening of the time limits for the payment of these fines we provide a clear indication to the thousands of producers involved and close a dark page of our country 's livestock history which has seen the imposition of limits on milk production by the European Union without taking into account how our production has always been less than consumption requirements in Italy Our amendment allows for the reopening of the time limits for sixty days thus activating the co-active collection phase by the Revenue Agency giving companies the opportunity to adhere to the installment that they could have benefited from in the first debiting phase This would cover more than 3,000 companies not a few for a total amount of more than 800 million euros on the one hand it would allow debtors to pay their damages without facing a co-active collection procedure also allowing them to access the benefits of public administration and on the other hand the administration to increase the level of recovery without bearing the burdens of enforcement procedures Therefore this amendment bringing debt restructuring to twenty five years generates liquidity to address this issue bearing in mind that those who have fines that exceed 300,000 euros can install them in twenty or thirty years with a single annual payment We considered it as a League that it was necessary to combine the indications coming from Europe without denying the excesses when necessary with the demands of the Italian producers Another important issue for us is climate change The decrease of 35 percent in rainfall on most of our peninsula hits with the entry into force from 1 January 2022 of the legislation on ecological outflow which replaces the one in place at 31 December 2021 on the minimum vital outflow The theme of the releases in the beehive in the summer period becomes fundamental in order to be able to implement the agricultural crops as foreseen by the modification on the land at rest of the CAP for about 200,000 hectares more for our country We approved a resolution from the Agriculture Commission in this House on 26 April last and I thank my colleagues in order to ask for an extension of the entry into force of this restrictive measure As the Lega Group we tabled an amendment to Article 21 to ensure that the resolution passed to a binding rule that could enter into force before the summer period which is also very dear to our agriculture The amendment was endorsed by the Commission The delicate geopolitical moment we are experiencing requires measures to deal with the economic effects of the international crisis in progress taking into account the agri food needs especially production Trials are therefore important but it must not enter into force by 2025 because it will certainly create problems for our agriculture Other measures have been introduced on this issue including some important also for the pig chain for the reduction of costs to implement the draft legislative decree on unfair practices We are witnessing strong tensions in the commodity market dictated above all by the role that uncertainty generates in relation to food supply scenarios The extraordinary peak in raw material prices has also worsened the living conditions of the weakest sections of the world 's population limiting their access to indispensable resources such as food and energy The surge in prices over this last period has been the highest in recent decades due to intensity and duration Think that the peak reached in the first quarter 2022 is higher than the peaks 2007 2008 and also at the level reached in the seventies of the last century in the midst of the oil crisis One of the points to highlight is that there is an almost identical trend between cereals oil and sugar so uncertainty reigns over all commodities This uncertainty affects farms and leads them to have to think more broadly and also in a different way in a more efficient and effective way The primary sector must immediately familiarise itself with new and mutual financial instruments in order to gain access to income stability which becomes fundamental We must not waste any more time to intervene both on simplifications and on support to give certain answers to a supply chain such as agri-food that certainly in the light of the strategic role it plays for the country 's economy deserves immediate and concrete answers from this Parliament"
"Bergesio L SP PSd Az Mr President organic farming is a very important issue for our country but I would like to mention the numbers of our agriculture which is worth almost 32 billion euros Italy is the first country at European level if we think that French agriculture is worth 30 billion and Spanish agriculture is worth 29 billion Organic is worth 3.5 billion euros and biodynamics is worth 200 million euros It is important to legislate on all issues as the rapporteur said earlier but it is also essential to understand the size of the area of interest of the measure The bill is important and fits into a context of great difficulty for Italian agriculture I would say that today is also a moment of great celebration for the inauguration of the agricultural fair in Verona an extraordinary event at international level where there will certainly be some equipment there will be moments of information and communication about especially organic farming I believe however that the value we give to this measure which is of great importance to more than 70,000 companies is substantial although these days it is already said that we are close to 80,000 individual companies at national level that are carrying out this activity They are young people who in a continuous growing are looking for a precise agriculture but above all give the opportunity to produce genuine food In the defence of this agriculture we are also looking for the protection of the health of the consumer which is fundamental Over the last decade sales of organic products have grown by more than 122 percent an important figure the success of consumption supports the increase in production in our country as has been said before by colleagues We are the first European producers and we are the second in the world but with a product control capacity that only Italy has at European and global level We must recognise this to our agriculture sector but above all we must recognise it to our producers who are struggling and also living a bureaucratic practice which through this measure we will try to simplify not in order to make sure that controls and checks are abandoned but in order to make it more immediate and faster from the computer point of view In this context of the industry 's full ferment the draft law under consideration is inserted which can therefore make an important contribution to the whole of our world Among the most qualifying points I would like to remind you the measure provides for the introduction of a brand for Italian bio in order to mark as 100 percent made in Italy only organic products obtained from national raw material In fact there is and we must also say this in relation to Italian soiling and to all the counterfeits of the Italian product in the world a real alarm for the invasion of products from non-EU countries with an increase in the quantity of product by more than 10 per year and with about one third of products from Asia where there is a very high control difficulty as we were able to verify in the hearings held in the Committee on Agriculture The brand is also an important tool for strengthening the presence of national products on foreign markets Much has been done by the Ministry of Agriculture for the dissemination and support of these products I would like to thank the Undersecretary Battistoni for his commitment to the promotion of supply chains which is very important We also look very carefully at innovation especially in the youth world In fact the bill provides for the possibility of creating digital platforms to ensure full information about the origin quality and traceability of products with a delegation to the Government and here the activity of our Ministers and our Subsecretaries returns to the field to review the legislation on controls and guarantee the autonomy of certification bodies Important elements are introduced in the law also for the definition and recognition of biodistricts as well as introducing in our system the forms of representation properly recognized and valued which was missing today innovative for the biological as up to now provided only for other specific sectors Our wish is to contribute to sustaining with this law a larger system that of national agro -food for which new development prospects can be opened up making it appealing to the younger generations and ensuring that there is a profitability that today is severely put into crisis in our agriculture by many factors by the very serious and uncontrolled increase of energy costs and by the increase of raw materials other fundamental aspect If anyone paid attention yesterday he would have noticed that cereal lists have marked frightening increases per tonne of product as far as national production is concerned On the other hand we have the problem of African swine fever which has not been eradicated at all on the contrary we are in the process of discussing this measure There is also the problem of avian influenza which involves large territories of our country Finally there is the very serious situation of the war which also involves a blockade of exports to those countries whose purchases up to now have implemented the production phase very much For all these reasons President we as Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione will vote in favour of the measure and we hope that in the meantime we will be able to give strength and energy to the other measures to help the Italian agricultural and agri -food sector always in the vision of a consumer attentive especially to its health"
"Mr President Minister drought damage is extraordinarily important We know that drought is not just a matter of this year for our country We started from afar at the beginning of the 2000s in 2003 the first very serious year of drought then 2017 and in part 2021 and now 2022 a very dramatic year In the last ten years the estimates were about 10 billion euros of damage due to drought in our country Only this year we are already talking about over 3 billion according to Coldiretti's estimates This means starting immediately with an important mechanism that of refunds to farmers which must be compensated for these damages But let us start with the measures that we are able to implement We have asked as the Lega Group already in the last decree the one on which we will have the confidence tomorrow to include the extension for 20 of fuel costs as a tax credit a measure which is included only for fishing but which must also be provided for agriculture and for the whole year Let 's make things easy and that can be accomplished Indemnization however also means adding important measures for credit implementing Ismea 's guarantees giving the opportunity to make liquidity more large for companies for our 740,000 farms Minister we do not want to contradict you but you made an important step in your speech and we have followed very carefully with reference to this notorious decree Well we 're not on any side jokes This decree should have been issued by the government for twenty days and so it was not But above all you tell us that we will see whether this decree will cover as I believe we have all read in this House the commissioners and submissaries for the management of the water emergency It now says that reference could be made to the structure of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers I do n't know if you 're referring to Casa Italia or some similar structure but I think if we activate these structures we 're not going anywhere We need to give clear responsibilities to well identified figures very carefully and to take the situation into their own hands and solve the problems Otherwise drought in our country will not be just a question of 2022 There are the great theme of the cleanliness of the riverbeds that of the recovery of the spaces of the invaders the theme of the detachment of the basins of the existing dams to be cleaned and of the increase of capacity In our territory there are structural problems and you know it well because the 1980 studies said that in our country the need for invading had to be 17 billion cubic meters to date we are at 11 billion cubic meters but potentially the need for hydro has increased and we would need 20 billion for agriculture So we 're traditionally behind In the Committee on Agriculture as President Vallardi who is sitting next to me and the rapporteur Senator Taricco know we have started a path to discuss and analyse a national irrigation plan But it is essential that the Ministry of Agriculture together with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and the Ministry of Sustainable Infrastructure and Mobility take the situation into account It takes a clear and orderly plan to draw up but let 's start with simple things things that exist We have seen that in these days the National Association of Bonifices and Irrigations ANBI has presented a plan to realize 223 small invaded 655 million cubic meters of capacity that could irrigate 430,000 hectares for a value of 3,25 billion Let 's start with this Let 's start doing these things because they become fundamental The ANBI has made this proposal which may or may not be pleasing because it is an expression of the reclamation and irrigation consortia but it has an important value because it is working very hard on it In addition to this there is also the National Union of Municipalities Communities and Mountain Authorities UNCEM which has made five important proposals efficiency planning encouragement concert the realization of these themes that come to the other side In my opinion there is a stimulus It is true that there are problems Just think of the mutual fund for catastrophal emergencies Minister this year in our country if only one farmer wanted to make sure for the drought he could not do it because no insurance company assured him the farmers wanted to do it but they could not Multi-risk insurance which is very important does not cover drought unfortunately it covers floods and other disasters such as storm and wind damage which is fine but not drought We know that on 21 July the company will be set up by Ismea who will manage the famous appropriation of 700 million euros per year and then through the SIN will also partially enter the Ministry of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policies What we are asking you from now to the end of the year is to activate this procedure the Agriculture Commission and the House will agree with you because we need clear answers on compensation to farmers We cannot think that even in 2023 no one will be sure about the drought because it means making a huge affront I conclude Minister by quoting one of your words on The Messenger today On the theme of water and drought I 'm a little tired of a country that talks talks and does n't You are right but think if the Minister is fed up what do our voters everyone think and what do farmers think I therefore ask you for an enormous effort to tackle the problem with President Draghi and with the Government because otherwise the drought emergency will become a disaster for all Italian agriculture"
"Mr President I too would like to thank all those who have committed themselves to this measure as well as the members of the Government who have been very carefully present in the Commission The measure to our examination is very important and is born not against someone but to give a hand and help a relevant chain of our country that of pig farming both in the phase of production and of transformation that has received very heavy shocks in the last months with a dry loss per week of over 25 million euros It is a real loss especially because African swine fever has entered a complicated environment and in an area where pig production is very demanding and numerous such as that of the Piedmont Region where over 3,500 companies operate in the sector with a million and three hundred thousand heads out of eight million products in our country On the other hand this chain is part of an Italian context in which we have a total of about 25,000 companies working in the livestock production sector and over 3,500 in the processing sector All this makes us think and it has made us think from the outset that it was important to give the necessary powers to try to eradicate this is the exact term on this front African swine fever just as other countries of the European Union have done such as Belgium which was able to intervene in a very short time The measure basically recalls three principles the first concerns the regions which must draw up be approved and have plans for the eradication of swine fever and for the containment of wildlife The second principle is the role of the Commissioner with his powers and resources available On this point the Commissions and the Government have worked well because in the end we have succeeded by tabling some amendments about fifteen in total to make the measure a turning point making it concrete and feasible especially because I am talking about Decree Law No 9 without resources and in such a context it was impossible for the Commissioner to operate Thanks to the intervention of the Minister of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policies Patuanelli as well as of the other ministries that shared the commitment 10 million euros were allocated resources taken from what was included in the decree support-b the 50 million euros measure 15 of which serve companies and enterprises to implement the biosafety principles also recalled by this decree On the other hand we felt it would be useful to resume from the remaining EUR 35 million for the processing sector EUR 10 million to use them immediately in this context because the Commissioner cannot act if he does not have the resources available This means it is a commitment of the Minister a commitment of ours and a commitment of the Government that these resources must be refilled and restored as soon as possible we have also presented an agenda on this matter so that it is ensured that in the first useful measure they must be restored in the correct context which is that of the pig supply chain which is suffering very serious losses In amending the measure we have also succeeded in giving the Commissioner clear powers as to how to act in its immediate day to day operation The issue of fences which my colleague Mrs Biti spoke about well before was also very important but we cannot only talk about fences or containment methods if we cannot then implement them because of urbanistic problems landscapes cultural heritage and everything that our country faces when we have something to do and it is unfortunately discovered that simplification exists only verbally and not substantially Here too we have managed to establish a rule with deadlines to be met but they are very fast if there is no response in twenty days there is progress especially on the issue of the public benefit that is given full mandate to the Commissioner For this reason I believe that the measure under consideration has taken up a number of important articles also on the topic of biosafety on which will be presented an implementing decree on which I invite the government to indicate clear measures asking that indications be given at national level especially to the farms and the breeders so that they can act in accordance with a system that makes it possible to preserve the breeding from external insertions I am thinking for example of the demarcation closure of all accesses of the revenue of the means of the personnel and fundamental of the material within the farm I am still thinking of the protection of sheds the management of dead animals the entry of all types of loads and also and above all the biosafety of those who enter those who work and those who work at the health level in the area of controls management and prevention Therefore it is necessary to ensure that this is a measure that guides our country especially because in sectors such as poultry important progress has already been made while on pig farming there is still some difficulty I think however there are conditions for doing well We considered it useful as I said before to present the agenda mentioned I appeal to the Government so that in the next measures it is possible to amend and directly perhaps with decree law to return the resources to the sector which as already noted is suffering We now have countries around the world asking for certifications that should not be required because pig meat or processed meat ham and cold cuts must come from areas or areas free from African swine fever This is absolutely not conceivable because we know that in the infected area there are two farms and in it the animals are killed There is therefore no problem from this point of view and above all we must act immediately to contain the situation Hence also the passage with the Regions that must act I would remind you that many of them have not yet transmitted plans for the eradication of swine fever and above all prevention Also those Regions must be operational because it is essential that from the point of view of the control of the Ministry of Health but also of the Higher Institute for Environmental Protection and Research ISPRA and of all those called to make important checks there is awareness of what is happening throughout the country We are here today to listen to the speeches that will take place during the general debate but above all to say that perhaps it is not the best possible measure that could be taken but we have all changed it together making it immediately feasible There is no doubt that other important measures will be possible in the forthcoming measures Someone asked us about the resources for all those sectors that are in crisis in spite of pig farming on the territory we also talk about those who carry out tourism activities of receiving tourists of those who operate on the territory in many ways However this has not been possible in the measure before us As it was not possible to amend Law No 157 of 1992 as requested by several parties with knowledge of the facts since no one has invented anything I call for this aspect which our Group has always advocated to be taken into account It is essential that the 30 year old rule should be amended These are not only wildlife damage but also damage to the cultivation and safety of cities Huge problems in our country must be tackled at the level of agricultural production also and above all on the containment of wildlife"
"Mr President I would like to thank all those who have spoken in general debate so far I would remind everyone that this measure issued on 17 February 2022 involved four Ministries in expressing their assessments in the Commission the Ministry of Sustainable Infrastructure and Mobility the Ministry of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policies the Ministry of Economics and Finance and the Ministry of Health The measure has been examined by two committees the Agriculture Commission and the Health and Health Commission and I believe that the work has been done in a short time I also say this to my friend Senator La Pietra In forty three days we brought the measure to the Chamber after having audited about twenty subjects in total there were 45 organisations and associations that had asked to be audited We have taken back everyone 's contributions very carefully This is a sensitive issue and I believe that this decree law will be schooled in future measures both as regards African swine fever and avian influenza I thank Senator Vallardi who mentioned a motion for a resolution that we have ready to bring to the House the containment of wildlife in our country is an important issue also raised by Senator La Pietra Senator Lunesu has told us about the experience she has experienced in Sardinia in order to treasure it We note this and have also taken note of it before in the Commission Senator Zuliani has invited us not to take more walkways on stages of large organizations such as Coldiretti Confagricoltura CIA union organizations but to proceed with measures that are able to solve the problem Senator Fregolent reminded us of the damage to the supply chain inviting us to act immediately As we have said before it is over 20 million euros a week that the supply chain is undergoing a crazy collapse between sales and production prices On the other hand there are costs which are not only the costs of African swine fever but they are the costs of raw materials they are the energy costs they are also and above all the costs of work combined with all the other economic factors that today weigh on the breeding the agricultural productions the 25,000 companies that in our country produce pigs Senator De Carlo spoke of a vision too urbanized of a rural Italy It is true I agree with him this is an important issue But on the other hand the issue of vaccines must also be seen on this issue if possible as well as on the issue of avian influenza which is another scourge of our country We also listened to Senator Boldrini who spoke about this sharing It is true that we wanted to give the Commissioner even more power not to put the regions in the background but to make them work in coordination Finally I believe that a good text has come out because the Commissioner will be able to work in close coordination with the economic resources we have given ourselves Senator De Bonis reminded us that positions must not be outrageous It is true because if we had started from the concept I say also to Senator Crucioli that this measure would have had to solve all the problems related to breeding agriculture wildlife the lack of collection of tourism the costs of managing the local authorities a sort of omnibus measure we would not have succeeded in doing so There will be other measures that will be able to solve these problems Senator Cantù spoke to us about the reform of veterinary public health a subject which I believe should be put on the agenda of this House You know that veterinarians in other countries of Europe depend not on the Ministry of Health but on the Ministry of Agriculture I believe that a reflection must be made on this issue above all starting from the concept of relationship and above all from the type of professional relationship between the veterinarian the breeder and all public health which is very dear to this country We have also listened to our Leader in the Committee on Agriculture whom I thank Senator Naturale to talk about a shared path that has been important We have done everything we can and I also thank the Budget Commission Mr Pesco and the Commissioners for the work they have done They have succeeded both in a proposal for an important amendment that we will see later Amendment 2.4 and Amendments 1.60 and 1.61 to take them back at the last session of the Budget Committee allowing us to clarify a point that was particularly dear to Senator Bruzzone but also to other senators I am talking about the identification not only of the provincial guards but also in some regions such as Liguria where the provincial guards no longer exist of the regional guards In the end with the term local police as the Undersecretary has explained we have resumed everything Thank you"
Mr President some of the data I am going to list are important in order to frame the issue that we are dealing with here today in this House Only 3 percent of the planet 's water is sweet and only 0.9 percent of it is represented by liquid surface water lakes streams rivers ponds readily usable by vegetation and life forms Although it covers 70 of our planet water is a finite and irreplaceable resource Water uses in Italy are as follows 54 per cent for agricultural and irrigation purposes 28 per cent for civil and drinking 20 per cent for industrial and 5 per cent for energy purposes Italy is in second place in the European Union for water withdrawals for drinking use with about 152 cubic meters per capita per year that is twice as much as the European average and is in the first place in the world and in Europe for consumption of bottled mineral water with a per capita consumption of 200 litres per year despite a quality of Italian water supplied by the very high network and recognized in most of the world Without water there can be no life and there can be no agriculture In Italy 85 of agri -food crops are irrigation the availability of the water resource is therefore essential to keep the quality agricultural system alive without which the competitiveness of Made in Italy agri-food and the vitality of most of our territories are at risk Water generates one fifth of the national gross domestic product but Italy is at the last places in the European Union for investments in the water sector investments on the water network are an average of 40 euros per inhabitant per year compared with over 100 euros per inhabitant of the European average The estimated increase in the invading capacity needed by the country to meet water needs during the period of scarcity is 5 billion cubic metres With a view to sustainable management of the water resource as the European Union also calls for projects and actions must be promoted that take into account the specific characteristics of the most fragile territories of our regions and encourage flexible management of ecological defluxes and encourage the evolution of the agricultural sector towards a model that involves the use of more efficient irrigation techniques Above all it is of fundamental importance the realization of invasions that allow on the one hand to face the lack of availability of water resources and on the other to protect the territory in case of extreme events such as floods that now more and more frequently devastate our peninsula The ecological transition in the use of water resources a path dictated by Community strategies and which we have very clear requires a great commitment and a great investment effort on the part of the water supply chain For the next five years the estimated requirement is about EUR 10 billion In this context as a Parliament we must support the increase in storage capacity In our country 89 percent of rainwater flows directly into the sea without being reused We must realize these small and medium invaded in order to give strength and energy to the destination of water to a plurimo use to what is civil human use to irrigation to industrial to the production of energy to the rolling of the floods In short there are a number of aspects that are absolutely binding and necessary to achieve a better usability of the water With this resolution the need to prevent national agricultural production for which measures have already been envisaged for the increase in production from being penalized by a combination of problems arising from the dramatic drought situation which since last autumn has hit the most important hydrological basins of the country to which are added the possible deleterious effects of the transition towards the new methodology of calculation of the minimum flow out vital to ensure the maintenance in the watercourses of the ecological outflow in support of the achievement of the objectives of environmental quality of water bodies under the framework directive on water This framework directive on water has been transposed in Italy by legislative decree of 3 April 2006 n. 152 the so called TUA single environmental text and provides for the definition with a special decree of the Minister of the Environment and the protection of the territory and the sea of the criteria aimed at guaranteeing the minimum life flow into the bodies of water providing that all the derivations of water still in place are regulated by the granting authority through the provision of releases aimed at guaranteeing the minimum life flow of water bodies With the decree of the Director General for the protection of the territory and waters of the Ministry of the Environment of February 2017 the guidelines for the updating of the methods of determination of the minimum vital outflow in order to ensure the maintenance in the watercourses of the ecological outflow have been approved The application of calculation methodologies unfortunately involves in the light of the studies carried out so far a significant impact on the derivations that beyond the climatic trend will be subject to serious restrictions such as to lead to a possible failure to meet the irrigation needs of the entire territory with inevitable repercussions on agriculture the environment and also on tourism the industrial sector and the craft sector We therefore propose the achievement of the experiments delaying for this purpose the time limits for adapting the water releases of the existing derivations for a period of at least two years allowing within the same period the realization of activities of analysis of hydraulic and climatic data as well as socio- economic studies for the identification of interventions also structural aimed at preserving the food safety of the population and the maintenance of the economic system of the Country without prejudice to the respect of the previous discipline on the vital minimum outflow in force until 31 December 2021 We also call for an immediate commitment to the Government and Parliament to find the appropriate financial resources to support the study and analysis activities needed to complete the transition from the minimum vital outflow to the ecological outflow We also call for the adoption of a strategy for regulating water consumption that aims immediately at the realization of collection works for the reduction of water collections and the increase of the water release of the invaders of the water basins considering also to intervene on domestic uses through interventions aimed at water saving and consequently also energy saving Subsequently in the medium to long period we also call for the adoption of compensatory systems for the implementation of consumption so as to allow the allocation of suitable financial resources for the realization of new and more efficient aqueducts with automatic reading and innovative systems the implementation of the capacity to invade the water basins and finally the realization of new invades I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Food Production of the Senate President Vallardi and all my colleagues for their efforts We have been working on this since October 2021 I also thank the National Association of Consortiums for the management and protection of the territory and irrigation waters Anbi its president and director the authorities of the basin the environmental organizations the Regions the Ministries and all those who have carried out a proactive activity on this measure Everyone has assessed it positively in support of our agriculture which means today more than ever nature environment and food
"Mr President European policies aimed at improving the sustainability of the agricultural and agri -food system cannot fail to take account of the peculiarities of our production system The most dramatic effects of current climate change are being measured on agriculture This summer 's severe drought is bringing companies to their knees which are facing an unprecedented water crisis We are talking about a historical drought harder much harder than that of 2003 and 2017 The estimates speak of 3 billion damage already caused by this drought The wheat being harvested is among the least at risk crops with an expected drop of no less than 30 percent Added to the loss is the 170 increase in the cost of fertilizers and the price of agricultural gas oil almost tripled in one year Fruit and vegetables soy and corn are the most endangered crops Rice deserves to speak to itself Without rain the administrations of Pavia Novara and Vercelli will have to choose between the preservation of the harvest and the rationing of water for civil use The consequences are serious and dramatic also for energy production already in distress due to the gas crisis Over 175 municipalities in Piedmont 36 in Lombardy and 14 Emilia Romagna are served by Civil Protection As far as the hydropotable service is concerned the situation is now a real emergency For agriculture and farms especially the North and the Centre they are suffering this dramatic climate change Italy however let us be clear is in the European context the country with more water with 302 billion cubic meters of rain per year of which 53 billion cubic meters usable of these however we manage to store only 11 percent that is 5.3 billion cubic meters We have a great wealth of watercourses 7,594 lakes 324 and over a thousand large groundwaters but at the same time we have a lack of infrastructure never renewed since the war 600,000 kilometers of water supply which on average lose 42 percent of water Irrigation then in Italy is a fundamental condition for having a competitive agriculture on the global markets and consequently an agri-food system of excellence In fact to be threatened is also the competitiveness of the agri -food made in Italy already hit by the increases in energy costs resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and those of raw materials these events that combined with the climate emergency in place risk creating irreversible damage to the Italian agri -food system The Italian model is at the heart of the debate on green policies developed within Europe The sector is one of the most competitive at European level yet the project seems to be to bring about a dismantling in the name of a universal diet based on the consumption of synthetic and ultra- processed foods from vegetable meat to milk made with fermented proteins Italian meat is born from the systems of breeding that for safety sustainability and quality are among the best in the world making it a food of absolute excellence whose consumption is indicated in a healthy and balanced daily diet As for synthetic milk we are talking about putting into crisis over 25,000 stables a sector that in our country is worth 16 billion between harvesting production and processing We therefore call on this House today through this intervention to act in a structural way primarily by investing in the modernisation and security of European water networks with a view to stimulating actions in the implementation of small invaders Today the catch capacity is 11 percent that is we have 11 billion cubic meters of water invaded in our country think that according to the 1980 studies the need was to be 18 billion More than 45 of the resources are missing from the appeal On the other hand the particularly important National Recovery and Resilience Plan offers € 1.320 billion to the irrigation system The problem is that this amount must only be used for efficiency and extraordinary maintenance no new plants can be built From this point of view too we call on the Government to have this funding changed in Europe especially in the light of the future CAP because there is also an important link on these issues We are on the side of our farmers producers consumers for food and above all the quality of our products and production and if we have water we must contain it to use it"
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would just like to mention two basic passages The measure started from the Senate thanks to the initiative of the members of the Agriculture and Food Production Commission and on all President Vallardi This is an important bill in view of the great crisis that the agriculture sector is experiencing because of the increase in raw materials energy costs and the difficulties associated with the lack of matching of rising prices of products for sale The initiative is placed in a general framework where the risk of supply connected with the international crisis gives the possibility to enhance the role of our productions Already since 2020 there has been a growth compared to previous years of more than 7 of Italian family companies and companies that have decided to invest in direct sales which in our country is worth over 6 billion euros I have concluded and I ask that I be able to deliver the written text of my speech
Mr President the measure before us comes to the House after a particularly complicated and difficult period such as lockdown which has changed the consumption habits of Italians in particular by strengthening their sensitivity to the issues of health and safety the origin and sustainability of food purchased Today in fact statistics show that in recent months Italians have made much healthier choices moving towards higher quality and safer foods both in terms of origin and production methods In fact I would like to point out that this measure is different from the previous one which dealt with small local productions for sale This is the sale to zero kilometer or to useful kilometer so we speak of 70 kilometers from the place of production or in any case of transformation Direct sales especially close to zero kilometer have become choices by consumers 22 percent of consumers say they have increased their purchases of these categories 28 percent have started to buy food from short supply chains just during the Covid 19 period and we hope they will continue in the post Covid 19 period Zero kilometre foodstuffs shall mean those agricultural and livestock products including aquaculture and products from places of production and processing of raw material or raw materials at a distance not exceeding 70 kilometres radius from the place of sale or in any case from the same Province of the place of sale or from the place of consumption of the catering service as well as fresh sea fishing and inland fishing products from landing points at a distance not exceeding 70 kilometres radius from the place of sale We also have an important initiative which is that of valorization through trademarks of production and distinction On this the Ministry will probably have to implement a policy of organization and harmonization in order to coordinate a system of all the brands that start from organic that we have approved the past weeks zero kilometer small local productions and all the others This is in order to succeed in having a clear picture always in defense of both the small producer and the final consumer who wants to buy these products Mr President I would like to add the full text of my report to the Minutes of today 's sitting
Mr President the issue we are dealing with today is of considerable economic importance but above all on the repercussions it can have on the entire Italian country system We know that hundreds of Italian companies have survived the pandemic despite the huge declines in turnover today they risk to end up on their knees permanently because of the consequences of the war in Ukraine One in three statistical data and prospects for hand if it is not supported and helped in the various sectors risks closing The Government has already put in place concrete measures to support businesses workers and families I am referring first of all to energy price control measures against expensive bills allocating more than France and more than Germany For the benefit of companies operating agricultural and fishing activities the important contribution of the tax credit for the purchase of fuels in the first quarter of 2022 has been recognised we want to extend it so that prices do not return to the reference average for 2021 We must take a further step forward however and we cannot stand by and watch We need concrete measures up to the level with an extra budget deviation We need to review the National Recovery and Resilience Plan tear down all accounting records for five years and carry out important sectoral interventions starting precisely from agriculture the primary sector let 's never forget that if you lose agriculture lose food lose the future of our country We have a challenge ahead of us Through the maneuvers of public finance we have come to the challenge of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan which itself has a considerable investment programme both public and private In front of us however we have two orders of problems The first is linked to the implementation times of the interventions in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan which will be long Above all there is still no shadow of simplification We have bureaucratic regulations that engulf the speed of implementation of the Plan On the other hand there is the need as we have repeatedly said to re-determine the development objectives in the light of the increase in energy and raw materials costs which are unsustainable for the primary sector It has also been said by the rapporteurs that for the current year we have available a margin of 0.5 percentage points of Gross Domestic Product amounting to approximately € 9.5 billion which will be directed to actions to contain the price of fuels and the cost of energy to cover the increase in the prices of public works to increase the funds for credit guarantees and more generally to alleviate the economic impact of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine According to a study by Intesa Sanpaolo the war will on average cost 2000 euros more to the family and a total increase of expenditure of 188 billion euros for the purchase of goods and services by Italian companies compared to the pre-conflict period We know very well what the tax burden in our country is we are close to almost 50 With regard to the agricultural sector in addition to the measures in favour of the whole energy and energy sector we also called for the support of research and together to strengthen the training system for young farmers in order to facilitate the introduction of new technologies and thus promote this process of ecological transition so important for our country We have also called for measures to be taken to cut back to calm down to contain prices and to provide for the necessary controls Here too checks are necessary The guarantee authorities must do their job both on fuels and on the entire energy phase of our country An important issue concerns the mutual fund relating to natural disasters and meteoclimatic disasters which is of vital importance to our country I would remind this House that many of our farmers have already been frozen at the beginning of the year and hailed on crops which were not insured because the insurance companies could not and wanted to ensure causes the risk Let us remember the approval also in the Commission of our requests to maintain protection including in favour of fragile workers and to extend them for as long as necessary We have expressed the need for some important measures for the primary sector We have entered the government above all in the spirit of not cutting taxes and we do not want this important element to be flooded with other choices These are choices that we do not share and therefore we will always work and monitor to ensure constant and concrete support for the productive sectors and families in order to try to hang up that recovery that seems lost to date
GARNERO SANTANCHE FdI Mr President I also speak at the end of the sitting The Brothers of Italy Group takes note of the declarations of the League and its Holding Company However we would like to point out I am sorry that the House is now empty that for months Brothers of Italy has been fighting on the green pass and has tabled amendments We have said in all fora both in the Commission and in this House that this measure would lead to a great deal of economic and employment problems but our words have always fallen into the void I remember that we are the only country in the world that has introduced such a limit for those who work and above all that this is a measure that is not health but political that is leading to real disasters Therefore we are very pleased that we are taking note of this today but I recall that the Government and the majority that supports it have always spoken out against any of our amendments aimed at putting an end to this discrimination We will continue in our battle but it seems to me that time has expired Moreover Italians understand the absurd up to forty nine years you can go to work without the super green pass while after fifty you can not do it I say this without even dwelling on all the procedures that have been provided for the smart working
"GARNERO SANTANCHE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen we are truly based on what happened on this decree This is a question of method As you all know it expires on 30 April Therefore we did not understand why the measure came from the House yesterday at lunchtime and this Government today decided to put trust in the Commission yesterday we had a great battle the Undersecretary was also present asking if there was any element of urgency that escaped us In fact we could not understand why having still time we were not given the opportunity to do the work for which we are paid to go to the Commission to table amendments and comments and to vote on them Mr President we have not been given an answer to this We are here today with yet another vote of confidence on a decree so full bodied made up of 43 articles which is the first measure on a topic as direct as that of the energy problem We are here to say nothing to take this decree law in a closed box and to vote for trust not us but the majority will We have heard so many speeches from those who are in the government today and are a majority that we could not trample on Parliament 's priorities that we had to recognize Parliament 's dignity and allow it to exercise its role then we see that when certain people are sitting on the seats of the government they change their minds and the fact of trampling Parliament is no longer straight opening the Palace as cans of tuna is no longer straight You 've lost whatever I think but it 's okay Madame Marquise keep it up Coming to the merits this decree law was sold to us as if it could solve all the energy problems of our nation above all we were told that it had been done to protect families and businesses We on the other hand absolutely do not see the strong signs of troubleshooting Then there is another issue that worries us no one takes into account the inflation that is galloping in our nation which today tell us to be equal to 6.7 percent What is the reason for this inflation I believe that we have all understood this it is due to a greater extent to the high fuel the high energy and the increase in the cost of raw materials Perhaps only the government of the best does not realize a topic that will actually lead and I do not want to be a Cassandra to the collapse of our productive system But alas we have also had this great disappointment from the Government especially because we see that in this decree law the bureaucracy increases so it will be even more difficult for the enterprises and there is no sign of what would be fundamental and called a term much abused by the majority but not applied simplification This measure shows that the sirens of no and radical chic environmentalists are increasingly being heard Today we do not have a vision of energy supplies and what should reduce our dependence which I remember has not diminished in the last five years but has increased because the gentlemen do not sit today in the government and alas have a fundamental influence on everything that is decided Today someone should take a conscience test and think that if our nation is in this situation it owes it to those who only knew how to say no No it has been said for example to the new generation of nuclear power which would allow the disposal of waste and then however to buy nuclear power from our neighbouring countries it has been said no to the regasifiers which absolutely could not be done it has been said no to the extraction of gas in our home and then to go and buy it in other countries No has been said about regasifiers and today the government is working to buy floating ones spending a lot of money and encountering serious problems to find them because they are not so easy to find I remember the election campaign of Mayor Gualtieri when he swore to all his voters that he would never make the thermo-energy plant in Rome Today 's news is that Mayor Gualtieri has announced the arrival of a thermo-energy plant in Rome I do not know whether it is right to act in this way to show up in an electoral campaign in a certain way to take a few extra votes and then a few months later to deny it These things should n't happen Let me give you another example the Lombardy Region has made available 12 million euros in order to be able to change the boilers to polluting biomass because we know that they pollute with a technology classified with a name that sounds a bit mocking 5 stars and that will allow not to pollute The Lombardy Region has made this sum available and do you know what happened This funding may go to 1,505 of the 1,506 municipalities of the Lombardy Region but heard not to the City of Milan because the Mayor Sala prohibited the application of this technology It 's called Sala and it belongs to your majority What should we say that we are part of an opposition force patriotic that we would have wanted to make a contribution to this which is the first decree that is issued after 24 February and after the invasion of Ukraine You think you are better you know how to do everything but you have forgotten in this decree the interest of the production system of our nation because there is practically no measure to support companies Yesterday you freed 10 billion of resources by believing that you are making an epochal intervention but you will have seen that Germany in order to contain the increase in prices has made 100 billion available To you who fill your mouths with Europe at every opportunity but only when it is appropriate I would like to ask how you feel today that you allocate 10 billion without giving answers when Germany allocates 100 billion It would be good for you to do a truth operation with the Italians and after two and a half years of a pandemic which no one wanted for which you asked for sacrifices to the Italians tell the citizens clearly that we are facing an energy lockdown Have the courage to say that families and businesses will have to suffer an energetic lockdown due to your lack of vision Do you remember the famous Sundays with alternate plates the famous Sundays on foot The problem for our nation is not represented as President Draghi said by the choice between the air conditioner and peace but by the need to support our productive system and know that the resources that you do not spend today you will spend it tomorrow because you will have to pay the Cassa Integrazione for those companies that because of your inability will have to close and fail Congratulations For all these reasons the vote of Brothers of Italy will be strongly opposed"
GARNERO SANTANCHE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen the Brothers of Italy are voting against both on the subject because we would like as we have asked several times the abolition of the super green pass and because we find ourselves once again in the government 's umpteenth request for confidence Brothers of Italy is for no to trust this Government but I would like to motivate it We are opposed because the Government has demonstrated its inability to manage the pandemic also because we must say it clearly we see that all the data comfort us from this point of view We have seen the decline in contagions the decline in intensive therapies by now it is clearly below 10 percent the decline in hospitalizations in the Covid departments So we can't understand why you still want to continue on the road to the super green pass Instead you should note rather than the narrative and the story that this majority makes to the Italians that the management of the pandemic has not been successful I say this with great regret Unfortunately Italy as the official data say because it is not that said Brothers of Italy is among the first countries in Europe and in the world both by mortality and by the lethality of the coronavirus This should make everyone understand that as we say perhaps there have been errors in management I do not want to talk about how much money has been taken away from public health over the years it is over 37 billion If on the other hand these investments had occurred the management of this pandemic could have produced completely different results But let 's come today The data tell us that Italians have been extraordinary in getting vaccinated despite all the confusion even from the point of view of communication that this Government has done on vaccines I think you all remember what happened with some vaccines first over fifty then over sixty then over forty surely creating confusion fear doubts and questions from Italians Despite all this however despite the government 's inability to manage communication and information with Italian citizens today we can say that Italians have been extraordinary because over 90 percent is now vaccinated The government then should note that those who wanted to immunize themselves have been vaccinated and those who did not do it today we do not believe that it can change their mind maybe a small part will do it but not so much as to substantially change the numbers of the vaccinated I remember here too the confusion made by the government giving the data on the famous cover that we had to have to make sure that the virus circulated less among the Italians Here too however these data have now completely disappeared Why then continue with the super green pass Why continue in addition to denouncing what is a fundamental principle of our Constitutional Charter which in the first article states that the Italian Republic is based on work Why continue complaining not only about the Constitutional Charter but also about what has been done which could have been done with swabs before Among our amendments which of course were rejected there was precisely the request for salivary swabs Instead today you decide that the over 50 cannot work they cannot therefore receive a salary they cannot give continuity to their family because you take away their salary It is a very serious thing moreover at a time like this really dramatic for families with the increase in the cost of light and gas with the inflation that is coming in a very heavy way in a cross-cutting way that will then hit everyone And you continue in this decision to take off the job to take the pay off the over 50 workers I am a little grounded because I thought that the union which in Italy at least in words has always filled its mouth with the defense of the workers had something to say instead it is silent shut up The left which has always filled the mouth of being on the workers side will once again vote in favour of this measure today in this House But especially with the acts you contradict each other between what you vote and what you want I would like to take you back in fact to the time when we elected the President of the Republic and all of us were asked regardless of having all three doses of vaccine the first the second and the booster to do the swab And we were asked the same morning because it had to be not only a third generation buffer but also done in the last few hours We had to take a swab because otherwise none of us could have had access to the election of the President of the Republic He denies you on his own Do things and then implement others How do you feel in front of the Italians when the swab goes well for you beyond the vaccines That morning I did n't understand why even though I had all three vaccines I had to take a swab There is something in your facts and narration that does not come back and see that time is a gentleman from this point of view For the truth will come out and you will be disproved by the facts Why do you keep not thinking about those families where maybe there is only one person who brings home the salary and who will not be able to put together lunch with dinner for their children Despite the data that you all know and that I have reminded you continue to make mistakes Brothers of Italy cannot be there not because we are against vaccines I want to say it clearly Not only does one person speak of course who did all three doses of vaccine but I also remember that we have always said that vaccines were absolutely fundamental in the fight against Coronavirus because they saved from the cemetery and hospital certainly not from the contagion I do n't even want to remember when on July 22nd last year the President of the Council Draghi in a press conference told all Italians that the green pass gave the security to attend safe places because it was not possible to contagion How many lies how many things have you told that they were not right that science has denied Afterwards long after what we said we certainly did not want to replace doctors we were right because the vaccine does not exclude from contagion It is true and I say it forcefully that excludes serious illness And so today we take note of the Government 's will to continue to make mistakes we also take note once again that you put trust I remember when some Members of the Movimento 5 Stars said that Parliament 's role had to be absolutely central Once again however you will vote for the confidence of a government that is being trampled on by Parliament which does not enable us all to do our work in the Commissions and by tabling amendments Nothing all this does not apply to you and then very often your mouths are filled with a word called democracy
Madam President Minister I have listened carefully to what you have come to tell us in this House and I say to you that I had the impression that yours was a report a lesson almost from university explaining the cubic meters explaining various problems from where we import the gas and more Minister I believe that in this House that of the Senate of the Republic you should have brought solutions today He should have let the Italians know what will happen to their lives their businesses their families in the coming weeks Instead he did n't say anything about it at all In our opinion there are two fundamental elements the war that Putin waged in Ukraine has changed and is changing the world Therefore in his report today he should at least have mentioned the PNRR which is obsolete today and has no sense of existence as it was written and thought If I am not mistaken about 40 of the resources are on the ecological transition Do you think that at this moment where they are bombing where they are killing the theme is the ecological transition or the survival of our industries and our families When you came to the industry committee you considered my question provocative It is not provocative Minister but simply of common sense In life in fact not everything is an immovable paracarriage If there are situations which certainly none of us had considered and which we are living things change You 're the government of the best There is a President in Office of the Council who is certainly authoritative who in Europe can express his vision without it and without it and I hope that he will also be heard What are you waiting to tell us that that PNRR needs to be changed in its foundation That 's the first question I 'd like you to answer which you have n't done yet In addition Minister there is a second element In addition to this frightening war that we are experiencing our businesses have been living for two and a half years three winters a series of economic disasters and I believe you know the life of the real country Everything that has happened in fact has certainly impacted very much on our economic life Therefore it is time to understand what needs to be done For us as Brothers of Italy what needs to be done is very simple we need to immediately put our hands on excise duties and VAT not to worry more about economic coverage Given the escalation of prices the state has collected more VAT and today could have the money to calm down all those highly energetic production sectors and perhaps make them work more quietly Mr Minister what will happen when you imagine because we do not have the confidence of this not to intervene on prices or perhaps to intervene late throwing away time that time that businesses and families do not have If you do not decide today but perhaps it was good to do so yesterday to lower the price of diesel and energy the companies will close the companies will fire and the cost on the social shock absorbers will be much higher than the intervention that you should do today This is therefore a very short sighted vision Minister we are also pleased when you say that perhaps within thirty or forty months we will be able to be less dependent on Russia or other countries Families and businesses however are not thirty six forty months old families and businesses are thinking of tomorrow Did you see what 's going on in the transport sector We are one of the countries with the highest number of trucks for road transport and if they stop everything will stop because we will have the problem of going to the supermarket to do the shopping I therefore think that you should take action without delay I would have expected you to come to this House today to say that energy is a primary asset So far in fact I 've talked to her about companies and families but I could also talk to her about all those people who are disabled and fragile who are currently attached to machines to keep living Do you realize that there are Italians for whom energy is a primary asset because without that tube attached to a plug they would die Can we say then that energy is a primary asset I have n't heard a word from this government about fragile people Minister you must give us an answer because when a Minister of the Republic says that there is a gigantic scam and that there are speculators you must tell us if they are natural persons and in that case you must say name and surname or if the speculators and scammers are those who today determine the price because in that case you as Minister and member of the Government in two minutes can decide if this is the problem to reevaluate the price formation Brothers of Italy have said this for many days and yesterday a motion was also presented to the House Our proposals are simple but effective and above all would impact tomorrow on the lives of businesses and families I cannot understand why perhaps by deciding to evaluate three months in three months it is not established that VAT and excise duties will be eliminated tomorrow You know very well Minister that in that way the price would be completely different I am sorry to some extent to correct a professor but I must remind you that a few days ago you said that the average price of fuels would not exceed EUR 1.95 On Monday March 7 he took over the average price of fuel weekly and reported a finished price of 1.95 euros per litre for green petrol as we know however he exceeded the 2.30 euros amply In that case too perhaps it would be better not to make such a daring forecast which in one way could put citizens in a more tranquil position thinking that that is the maximum price because you know that it will most likely come over EUR 4 per litre In conclusion Minister today we did not expect a lesson or a report we believed that the Italians who hang from his lips could understand if their trucks can circulate if they can continue to produce tiles if paper mills can still make paper if those Italian excellences can still continue to produce because there are no solutions from university lessons
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen today we are talking about a measure that has in itself been exceeded because the Government has decided to give a gift to the Italians In fact we had the Christmas decree then the New Year 's decree and then the Epiphany decree This is to say in short that wrong is human but persevering is diabolical The government continues in its contradictions and I give you some examples because I believe that it should be clear to the Italians the direction that is being taken The first contradiction concerns the fact that the government has focused everything exclusively on vaccines I would like to point out that I myself have taken the third dose and in the Brothers of Italy Group we are all convinced that the vaccine is a useful and necessary tool However we believe that it cannot and should not be the only instrument And I 'm not saying that I remember President Draghi when in the press conference of 22 July introducing the obligation of the green pass he said that it delivered to the Italians safe places where it was not possible to get infected I do not have to remind the House of the number of cases of infection and the number of deaths The government therefore contradicts itself Seeing every night the war bulletin in which the numbers of tampons contagions and deaths are reported contradicts the government 's policies on the vaccine To see that we have reached almost 250,000 contagions and that the dead unfortunately we speak not of numbers but of people are about 300 per day does not calm the Italians A government that 's focused on the vaccine and green pass should n't contradict itself The other contradiction that I would like to make very clear is the lack of sense of informed consent I believe that the latter applied to a health treatment imposed for all people of common sense and not ideological is absolutely unreasonable All those who went to vaccination had in front of them the form bearing the words I agree and authorize the administration of the vaccine This is the formula found at the bottom of the form when you go to make the vaccine However it is clear that this is an informed consent present in the forms that also gives the possibility to refuse the administration of the vaccine The theme which has already emerged and which Brothers of Italy have noted for a long time clearly is that today the subject of informed consent for the new measures adopted by the Government is more strongly imposed I am referring here to the application of the vaccination obligation in the measure we are examining for certain categories and in the Epiphany measure for all over fifty Therefore the question that the Assembly and the representatives of the Government should ask themselves and that all non-ideological people but of common sense are asked is whether it is legitimate even today to ask for the consent of those legally obliged to make the vaccine In our opinion it is not because informed consent even according to a recent decision of the Constitutional Court is envisaged in order to guarantee the freedom of all citizens thus respecting the second paragraph of Article 32 of our Constitution What interests us most is that this not only does not concern respect for freedoms but also has an effect on the imputation of responsibilities and that is what the Brothers of Italy Group has always asked for If the government I do not go into the matter if it has done well or has done wrong has decided for the obligatory vaccine precisely to be transparent and to convey confidence to the citizens it should take all the responsibility and not only for the compensation to those citizens I hope very few that they should have adverse reactions to the vaccine but also for compensation damages In fact I remember for example that if informed consent is incomplete and perhaps it is not said so based on incorrect scientific assumptions there is also the possibility of compensation for damages Therefore the government should note that the scenario has completely changed since the vaccine became mandatory There is therefore a vaccination obligation and in this case mandatory consent of the person concerned for this reason we say that there is a contradiction in terms The government not only has to put an immediate hand to informed consent but must put the funds which we have not found to pay those very few we hope adverse reactions to the vaccine I also say to you that there is no green passes which as the data show have had no effect on the infection I remember that just before the Christmas holidays the government filled its mouth saying that it was the best of all European governments that in Europe there were so many cases and that Italy was absolutely a model Colleagues today you are denied and perhaps someone should also reflect on what has been said about British Prime Minister Boris Johnson You all criticized him saying it was a disaster But if we look at Britain 's figures today and above all the number of deaths perhaps our government which has taken this direction should ask itself a few questions Then there is one more element if we are all convinced that the vaccine is useful and we still have to convince the many over fifty that they are not vaccinated what better than to say that the government assumes responsibility and therefore if there are adverse reactions the government has made funds available to pay compensation Once again the Brothers of Italy Group makes its request on this point which is crucial to convince those Italians that they have not yet convinced themselves also for the succession of decree laws and for the communication that is made also by science that critics We heard the WHO representative who said that we certainly cannot imagine moving forward with the boosters every three or four months Colleagues take note of this the responsibilities must be clearly shown to the citizens and there is no better way to convince the Italians to vaccinate than what the Brothers of Italy has always proposed"
"Mr President Minister Mr President in Office of the Council ladies and gentlemen many of President Draghi 's passages I must say frankly concern us very much and make us reflect on our near future When you say me the Italians asked perhaps you forget that in democracy the popular will is expressed only by the vote not on the platforms as the triggers used to us and not even by the calls organized by the Democratic Party I must tell you that even those who preceded me like Senator Casini from whom we are certainly divided many positions reminded you of the centrality of Parliament But when Mr President you bring up the two thousand mayors I would like to remind you that they are a little less you forget that in Italy there are eight thousand mayors And what about the other 6,000 mayors who did n't sign the organized appeal For us Mr President in Office the mayors are the representatives of the institutions not the masters of the institutions It 's a fundamental difference I must also say that I have thought about your story Mr President in Office of the Council a story of great commitment and certainty the story of a man with a straight back who has always tried to do the interests of Italians I therefore ask you if you can explain to me in your reply what has changed in these six days since you said a week ago that you were leaving because there were no longer any conditions for this Government to work What has changed these six days We have not seen any change Since you are a man who does things if you think you can do it because I do not think you need that chair to occupy your time I have the doubt that perhaps you too Mr President in Office of the Council are not free to choose what you must and want to do If you answer in your reply I 'll thank you In one passage you said that there were unauthorized protests and I believe that you were referring to those for the Bolkestein directive and I add the protests of taxi drivers and beachmen I therefore ask you to explain to me whether the landings are authorized and if so who authorizes them in our country How come Mr President in Office of the Council today you did not say a word about the easy citizenship that the Democratic Party wants on free drugs that has been talked about so much these days Perhaps you are afraid of not liking the Democratic Party your true supporter In my opinion three clues make a test and today you gave us all three of these clues the first when yesterday morning you first met the secretary of the Democratic Party Letta the second as I told you just now when no flag of the PD was brought up to not hit him the third clue is his speech that was so wide in the program perhaps I misunderstand that I think I am the program for the next legislature Perhaps Mr President in Office of the Council you imagine training such as the so called Ursula coalition in order to remain President of the Council but I would also ask you to be clear on this in your reply because six months seem to me to be a few months in order to achieve such a detailed programme There is also a very clear point to which no one can unequivocally have understood something different Today in your speech you said these are my conditions take or leave If you want me to be the President of the Council you parties do n't count anything I do what I want and move on These are the conditions These are full powers those full powers on which the Left has had an infinite debate while today we find ourselves with a President in Office of the Council who in fact calls for full powers Starting at the conclusion we of Brothers of Italy as everyone knows ask for the vote and we do not ask for it today but we did it even when we were at 4 We do not just ask today how someone wants to make people believe because polls are for the benefit of our political movement we have always asked for this because we do not like the chaos nor the alchemies of the palace we do not like it when the choice is taken away from the Italians We want to vote immediately because perhaps unlike you we have a certainty a vision a program We believe that today we would need a strong government with a cohesive majority with a program made together because we must face the near future without shocks because we know the dramatic issues and the serious problems that afflict the Italians I 'll give you some unsolicited advice Mr. President We expect it would be good and fair that should you wish to continue this new political life it is you Mr President who are now asking for the vote Democracy this is clear to all can only be legitimized by the vote of the Italians there is no other method in democracies"
Mr President Minister the European legislator lays down a principle of common sense at the very least one knows about a drug how much less clinical evidence is available the greater the cure must be to monitor possible adverse reactions It is called additional monitoring was introduced into European legislation in 2010 and has been regulated in Italy since 2015 Additional monitoring requires two quite obvious things firstly it is recommended that healthcare professionals report any suspected adverse reactions secondly pharmaceutical companies should clearly describe in the leaflets how healthcare professionals and patients can report side effects It is a pity not to take the opportunity when the European legislator regulates himself according to common sense we have missed this opportunity in the case of Regulation 953 of 2021 which when introducing the green pass insists on the need not to make discriminatory use of it a blatantly careless indication in our country Unfortunately the rules on additional monitoring are also substantially disapplied during the pandemic in particular from the website of the European medicines agency EMA turns out that all Covid 19 vaccines currently used in Italy are subject to this monitoring for the simple reason that their marketing authorisation is conditional pursuant to Regulation No 507 of 2006 These were in fact medicines that met unsatisfied medical needs and therefore had to be introduced on the market but for which there was not yet complete data on safety and efficacy and therefore had to be monitored more carefully However the explanatory leaflets of the Covid 19 vaccines in Italy contravene the express provisions of the EMA not clearly reporting the adverse effects In addition there are no initiatives of the Italian Drug Agency Aifa aimed at raising awareness of health care personnel in relation to their obligations in the context of additional monitoring nor more generally whether and how the Aifa has undertaken the obligation to initiate additional monitoring programmes Aifa 's inertia in raising public awareness is remarkable Let me give you an example the last tweet in which the Agency mentions the pharmacovigilance portal www.vigidruga.it dates back to 23 November 2018 Throughout the pandemic the Aifa has basically kept quiet as if the reports were a nuisance to be discouraged and not a valuable and indispensable element to ensure the progress of science I guess negationism of side effects seemed like a good idea to someone Instead it is a bad idea and a serious error of communication because it arouses and legitimizes the most irrational fears That is why Minister we are interested in your clarification of additional monitoring
Mr Minister with an invisible smile because of the mask your answer does not go beyond all my perplexities honestly but that is not a problem I think the growing signs of dissatisfaction from the courtrooms are a little more problematic Let me give you an example the Council of Administrative Justice of the Sicilian Region in its ordinance n. 351 of 2022 expressly mentions the inadequacy of active and passive pharmacovigilance among the reasons for not manifesting unfoundedness of the question of constitutional legitimacy of Article 4 of Decree Law n. 44 of 2021 in the part where this provides for the vaccination obligation for health workers This is because according to the Constitutional Court the mandatory nature of a vaccine is only legitimate if among other things it is not expected to adversely affect the patient 's health without prejudice to the consequences which appear normal and therefore tolerable But in the absence of adequate pharmacovigilance this assessment is in re ipsa foreclosed I would like to spare you the list of judicial measures that are censoring the current pandemic fighting facility In particular the theme of the balance between the right to health and that to work is the subject of an increasing number of ordinances of the TAR which depreciate the logic of blackmailing underlying Decree Law No 44 of 2021 the same logic claimed yesterday with force and with the usual freshness by Minister D'Incà taking sides the courts in defense of Article 1 of the Constitution You see Minister the need to debate controversial issues is the incompressible essence of politics By suffocating the debate in the parliamentary classrooms you have only managed to move it to those of the courts where the government is increasingly succumbing because there unfortunately Minister it is not possible to pull right by putting the question of trust I therefore wish you every success in your efforts thanking you for it and for your willingness
Mr President I take advantage of the general debate on this measure extending the state of emergency and we hope that we can assume that it is the last for both legal and epidemiological reasons to leave a few brief remarks in the minutes The pandemic comes to an end wherever in Europe the restrictive measures taken or not taken are abandoned The rapporteur herself pointed out that the decree law but I should say the decree- law since Decree Law No 229 of 2021 has merged as an amendment in No 221 in question has now surpassed the events Everywhere in Europe we conform to the wise words attributed to Keynes When the facts change I change my opinions What would you do These words however Keynes never said Samuelson said them but they have a sense of themselves Forgive me the emphasis on the paternity of the quotation which is not only an excess of erudite fetishism but it is also a way to enter into the heart of a theme that I feel I must and I know I can bring to your attention the worrying cultural regression which risks being one of the heaviest and most persistent legacy of this pandemic a regression that has taken the worrying forms of the compression of every free debate in this and in all other forums for the benefit of a totalizing and totalitarian appeal to the principle of authority to the ipse ixit When what is said becomes less important than those who say it it is easy for us to start on roads without exit especially considering that in the Middle Ages ipse was Aristotle and today it is the Scientific Technical Committee in which forgive me all those involved I cannot see a huge progress if I must evaluate the contribution of this organism in the light of the instruments that my scientific training offers me to judge colleagues of unfamiliar discipline the validity of the forecasts and the internal coherence of the affirmations The journalists had fun and I do n't want to bore you with the repertoire of pirouettes and false predictions that this body has provided us I 'm going back to my concern I am concerned about the analogy between the use a certain policy has made of science and what it has been doing with Europe since ancient times Europe first and science then have become the means by which a political class has shunned its responsibilities among other things making these means an always curiously asymmetrical use Science has been used to close but it recalcits to use it to open science has been used to impose obligations that have proved to be scientifically unfounded but still do not want to take note of it Unfortunately and I am also referring to Mr Cantù 's remarks the first result of the high alpha and omega of our debate also political this paradoxical faith in science because I believe in science is an oxymoron science should be doubt investigation was that many citizens have lost confidence in the science and institutions that have taken refuge in it in order to escape their responsibilities A similar asymmetry again in the context of the measure we are analysing applies to the so called Europe which it is worth remembering would be the European Union The Covid 19 pass was born with EU Regulation 2021/953 as a tool to facilitate freedom of movement and avoid hateful discrimination it is in that spirit that I personally voted in favour of this House on 16 June 2021 at the time it seemed necessary to promote the free movement of European citizens in order not to kill the tourist season The application that has been made however has gone in another direction and we must tell us the instrument has been used to limit the circulation of Italian citizens and has given rise to a series of hatefully discriminatory behaviours and continuous intolerable violations of privacy including criminalization of citizens who were simply exercising their own right Among other things this has caused considerable damage which has been mentioned in this general discussion to many economic activities My colleague Mr Antonio Rinaldi 's question about how the Commission intends to intervene to combat these discriminatory behaviours has remained unresolved The European regulations apply when they are used for example with the bail in to clear the savings of Italian citizens they are interpreted when they are used to defend their freedom This is a curious asymmetry We must re-appropriate because we are capable of doing so our ability to judge the measures from their results From this point of view I must say that it is very difficult even in an international comparative perspective to give a positive judgment of the green pass in the version we have experienced in Italy with its set of obligations on whose dubious constitutional legitimacy Professor Alessandro Mangia spreads authoritatively in one of his last speeches The amendments which the League has tabled here and which it will present on the occasion of the next many deadlines of similar decrees are designed to make this instrument less vexatory What the League has however authoritatively asked at the mouth of its leaders is that it be definitively abandoned with the end of the state of emergency because we are concerned that our life is entrusted to a digital pass in a country that has not yet posed the theme of transposing into the Constitution the protection of the digital identity of the person the subject of a bill deposited by Mr Morelli to the House A country in which even that minimum right is not protected which is the ability to make and receive electronic payments and does not avoid condemning to civil death those who for some reason see themselves rejecting the opening of an account from a banking institution as Senator Siri asks for a long time with a bill of pure common sense on which we still await the opinion of the Government In theory passwords are digital and inclusive but then in practice the entire digital infrastructure is used to exclude and that worries us We are concerned to entrust our existence or digital pass in a country where there are no strong legislative garrisons against the possibility of seeing our digital identity crippled or reset but also in a country whose computer infrastructures have proven to be very permeable Here in Lazio always to remain on the subject of health it was demonstrated last summer with collapse due to an attack of hackers the infrastructure of the regional health with all the problems that then have been achieved So although it certainly will not be the intention because the intentions will certainly be excellent but we are concerned about an instrument that could be in fact the Viatico or the assumption of a capitalism of Chinese control If we want to regain competitiveness towards this important and to some extent worrying competitor we must not pursue it on its own path that of the system of social credits but we must continue to affirm our path towards progress which is the protection always and in every place of freedom Freedom not repression has guaranteed Europe its excellence and has made possible the many scientific and technological revolutions that today provide us with unthinkable levels of well being even a century ago Let us continue on the path of freedom
"Mr President I start from the summary of previous episodes On 31 March I replied to the question time by reminding the Minister of Health that the question of trust cannot be raised in courtrooms It is good to remember this in this speech for the reasons we shall see Meanwhile forty seven days later we are here fervently and eagerly waiting to vote yet another confidence faithful to the roadmap of this Government that has put on average the issue of trust every nine days It is a fact that objectively squeals with the extent of the parliamentary support which this Government enjoys and which determines in fact if not in its intentions a substantial abolition of the debate To understand us the theme is not so much the confidence that will be placed here in the Senate because it is somehow determined by the circumstances and by the regulatory times the decree laws must be converted within sixty days Legislative Decree No. 24 was published in the Official Gazette on March 24 and we remain seven days to convert it so a further passage to the House is not even remotely conceivable and this is peaceful The problem however is the question of trust in the House where given that adequate time has been taken for consideration Parliament 's amendments would have been expected to be taken more seriously This consideration has not been and we regret not only because it leads us to regard this decree with some regret as a missed opportunity but also because in the meantime in the courtrooms as was easy to predict the government 's system of countering the pandemic is receiving heavy censorship which would have been possible to avoid at least in some cases if more attention had been paid to parliamentary proposals in particular to some proposals of the League to which the Minister has opposed a refusal as firm as objectively in some cases incomprehensible I would like to take the example of Amendment 8,58 by Mrs Boldi who took care of the defence security and rescue personnel who are not in direct contact with the general public and patients and therefore requested that they not be suspended Well it was not intended to take into account this rational proposal and in one of the classrooms in which trust cannot be placed that of the tribunal of Padua on 28 April last the judge ordered the reinstatement without demand of an OSS failing to the vaccination obligation arguing that the vaccination obligation imposed on the workers in question does not appear suitable to achieve the purpose it aims to achieve which is to preserve the health of the guests The judge continues In fact it can be considered noteworthy that the person who has undergone the vaccination cycle can still contract the virus and infect others The safest method at present to prevent a worker from infecting the other persons present at the workplace is to have reasonable certainty that he is not infected reasonable certainty that as a visa cannot be given by vaccination but by the periodic submission of the worker to the buffer He therefore ordered the worker 's reinstatement essentially on condition that he showed a super green pass which is then that certificate of which we were told that he gave the guarantee of being among non-cultivated persons and therefore we do not understand why we must overcome it with more incisive measures when the problem is the guarantee of being among non-cultivated persons With Amendment 8.75 Mr Borghi had asked for the abolition of the application of non-vaccined teachers The proposal has not been accepted In another courtroom where the question of trust cannot be raised that of the court of Grosseto the judgment n. 203/2022 RG of 3 May 2022 has ordered the immediate reinstatement without demand of a teacher possessing enhanced green certification i.e. not necessarily reinforced by vaccination Amendment 8.60 called for the possibility for suspended staff to redeem their contributions This amendment was also rejected Not only that I learned just now from a doctor that the three months notice for dismissal cannot start during the period of suspension which means basically that a doctor who intended to quit to go and do something else should pay a heavy penalty to the health company at which he is employed Basically we want to harm the right of these people to a free and dignified existence for the rest of their days beyond the end of the emergency which in our opinion would not justify or ever justified such injury preventing them from having access at their expense to adequate pension treatment I 'm sorry to have to point this out but this thing which has gone through quite silence seems like an unheard of gravity We are engaged in a total war and extermination against those who have thought that they are making a choice under conditions of extreme uncertainty which justify hesitation I would like to remind you once again of the order of the Council of Administrative Justice for the Sicilian Region which considered that a referral to the Constitutional Court was not manifestly unfounded arguing among other things that pharmacovigilance has demonstrated during this period of serious deficiencies which were admitted by those responsible in the hearings we held There are organisational shortcomings lack of staff and governance problems all of them I repeat have been admitted It is precisely today that several associations have deposited a curian memory at the Constitutional Court to help the constitutional judge to form a judgment on various aspects including the state of pharmacovigilance I do not understand why it insists on measures that seem animated by a sterile punitive will subtly hysterical that no matter how well meaning it may be it is proving increasingly counterproductive every day also because among other things it contributes to that lack of health personnel that has become chronic during the austerity season of which only the strength in which I honour myself as a military denounced in time the drawbacks including the inevitable failure of what remains one of the best public health systems in the world If this is the case we must think that this is also and above all because of those who work there For all thanks we find nothing better to do than subject these professionals to discriminatory treatment which every day appears increasingly lacking in scientific bases as some of the judgments I have cited show in their narrative Then there is the stone banquet of the strategy of contrasting to the pandemic which is natural immunity a phenomenon under investigation and denied The healed are to put it in the words of the never too late Gigi Proietti the black knight of the pandemic 15 million people to whom it would be advisable not to break the soul since in all evidence there is no compelling scientific need to do so while there is sufficient and abundant scientific evidence suggesting that they consider them a resource as endowed with immunity substantially equivalent to the vaccine We have seen in other latitudes politics become the subject of fiction and vice versa but no matter how fertile the imagination of the writers is hardly one of them could have imagined that such an attack on labour law firmly written in the first article of our Constitution would be brought by the founder of Article One All this is bitterly beautiful but we need to put an end to it You did n't want to listen to us but you can't help but listen to the courts I say this not with pleasure but with bitterness because it seems to me very inappropriate to offer the judiciary such an opportunity to exercise an additional role of political direction by issuing clearly damaging decrees of constitutionally guaranteed rights I have referred to Articles 1 and 36 and others but I have done so again and I do not repeat myself The problem of a rebalancing of powers to be more explicit the problem of a certain exondation of the judiciary already exists However if we break the embankment of the Constitution we cause this problem and therefore we lose the right to complain about it and the credibility to intervene With great humility but with just as much determination I urge all colleagues to reflect on this point I am sure that if we maintain the pace of confidence every nine days we will not lack opportunities to correct this trajectory Let us work together not to lose these opportunities in mutual respect and for the interest of the country"
"BAGNAI L SP PSd Az Mr President I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for this complex measure I would also like to thank the Government for the help it has given us by coordinating the drafting of the majority resolution in full respect of Parliament 's voice Finally I would like to thank my colleagues in the majority for the sensitivity with which they have been able to cooperate in finding a fall point that respects the physiognomy of the individual groups the role of Parliament 's direction and also the inexorable logic of the data that as many have pointed out shows us a rapidly evolving reality not unexpected but unfortunately not favourable In principle if not all much divides us in this majority from the most remote history which sees us children of ideological matrixes often very distant to the most recent current in which if we wanted we could draw reasons for bitter political contention or for insane personal resentment But while we were aware that not everyone would understand this choice of ours we decided to look not at what divided us but at what united us love for our country Love that everyone is free to interpret in his own way but that in fact has proved to be a strong enough glue to ensure the rapid achievement of a political synthesis Our vote is therefore strongly in favour for at least two reasons firstly because we see in the motion for a resolution issues on which we have committed ourselves together with our other colleagues in the majority during this year of government Let me mention a few the commitment to promote the use of deflated instruments of tax litigation and also to promote a finally orderly and rational management of the so called tax warehouse These are two issues on which an agreement had been reached with the Bagnai Fenu resolution Document XXIV No 53 approved in the Finance Committee on 12 October I also mention the interventions to facilitate the superbonus 110 avoiding penalising single family homes the ones that a certain press not close to the reality of the country and in particular its internal areas has renamed cottages and facilitating through their splitting the transfer of credits in full respect of legality but without hindering the recovery a topic also this the subject of innumerable amendments tabled by my Group also on measures being examined I also mention the theme of home therapies subject of the agenda G2 text 2 first signed by Senators Romeo and Castellone approved by this Assembly on April 8 2021 An increasingly topical theme as the unfolding of the evidence draws the various experts or self evident ones towards the need to face the pandemic with a more articulated approach as always demanded by the party to which I belong Or I would like to recall the issue of the cost of raw materials on which we have spoken a certain advance by depositing on 27 May last motion 1-00378 which perhaps deserved more timely attention from the Government and of course more than all others the commitment that the Government accepts to intervene to change the so called rules of the Stability and Growth Pact which are not rules because their application is largely discretionary as the facts have shown and they are not of stability and growth because it is necessary to suspend them when stability and growth are most needed This is an issue that we believe we have raised in times that are not suspicious I could add more but I do not make this list to plant flags a phrase dear to some of us because that is not the spirit On the contrary I do so in order to stress with gratitude the welcome and support that colleagues from other parties have given to proposals that we have had the opportunity to make because we have decided to be on board and that they have had the intelligence to accept because they have understood that they were made in a constructive spirit and not of prevarication The second important issue which supports our vote in favour of this motion for a resolution perhaps the most important one is the fact that it opens up the possibility of a timely appeal if circumstances require it the data from the International Monetary Fund indicate that they are already requesting it to the instrument of budgetary deviation This is to avoid the mistake made at the beginning of another crisis the pandemic one when a government carrying different competences let 's put it this way seriously underestimated the extent of the necessary intervention causing a degradation then difficult to recover of the situation Remember that the initial 3.7 billion went to over 100 billion resources needed to deal with the problem that the pandemic had created Of course with all this the DEF will also be perfectible moreover as I have just pointed out it contains in itself the seeds of its own improvement This government will be perfectible the majority who support it will be perfectible and of course possibly and with difficulty it is perfectible who speaks to you However I would like to repeat since it was not enough to say so that I find it funny I have no other terms ladies and gentlemen that here we receive lessons of austerity and financial hygiene from those who at the end of 2011 found this country with a public debt of 119 percent of GDP and handed it over to its successor with a debt of 132 Just to be clear in the post war period only the pandemic was able to do worse and I find it hilarious that it still insists on the story of future generations damaged by the prodigality of unconscious parents of spending parliaments These future generations should repay the debt as if the State were a commercial exercise whose business has a deadline which must be paid to creditors with any remaining active mass only that it does not work that way there is no date or at least I have no confidence in which the Italian State must bring down the clèr The public debt is supported as long as the country is able to honour interest payments and refinance the amounts due that is as long as the country grows A growing country does not create problems for future generations while a country that practices the rigor so dear to the heirs of a failed season and therefore failed of problems creates it And these problems are not the need to repay the debt I want to tell the millennials that they might come across in my speech that no one will ever knock on their door to ask for the refund of 2,000 billion cash this will not happen The problems that create rigour are the need to accept increasingly precarious working conditions to have to emigrate not to have adequate education and not to have a health system that meets the challenges of globalisation because the globalisation of challenges poses them and we are now fully aware of them Since we are talking about globalisation then a globalization whose crisis confirms so many of our intuitions let me say to avoid misunderstandings that it is not true that we have all mishandled globalisation Globalisation if it has been mismanaged has been mismanaged by those who could manage it because it was in power certainly not by those who were in opposition It has been mismanaged by those who have been led by easy enthusiasms by the empty and demagogic words of order that it pronounced to attract an easy consensus not by those who have taken on themselves the political and human cost of expressing a critical voice A little too easy to socialize now the losses of globalization after having tried with greater or lesser success to privatise its profits as well as frankly it is a little too easy to accuse in a more or less veiled way of a lack of seriousness a majority that instead will be an interested opinion my is proving in this as on other occasions to know how to work constructively towards the achievement of common objectives In a spirit of support for this joint effort I therefore vote in favour of the Lega Salvini Premier Party of Sardinian Action for majority resolution"
BAGNAI L SP PSd Az Mr President I rise in an explanation of vote on behalf of the Lega Salvini Premier Group We have seen that the diligent Member of Parliament makes the list in these circumstances not the electoral list that occupied us so much last month but he does a bit of the shopping list and a little of the list of regrets Everyone has done theirs and I will only add some political considerations I am in an uncomfortable situation for once because those who spoke before me have basically already made the considerations I wanted to make and I repeat The first consideration is as follows we come from a parliamentary term which is seeing an early end during which several times even at the events that then led to its end the issue emerged in the political debate that could not go to the vote because one could not interrupt an emotion or at least one could not interrupt the parliamentary work The fact that we are here more or less reluctant but that we have worked more or less efficiently shows what Mr Gallone said before the exercise of democracy takes place in the vote and in the electoral campaign that election campaign which some competent people wanted to suspend in the name of the emergency is in fact not at all incompatible with the orderly functioning of the institutions I would like to stress this so that we remember it where ever I hope not before five years we find ourselves in such a gruesome need to work in loose rooms I would also like to remind you here in particular to some of our voters who have legitimately contested some of the choices we made during this parliamentary term that the presence of the Government is important in resolving the problems such as for example the turmoil created around the theme of the superbonus Having a competent presence such as that of the Undersecretary Freni which we have the honour to have expressed in this government in Parliament is unfortunately crucial It has always been and has been all the more so in this parliamentary term during which we have seen that the legislative initiative is essentially in the hands of the Government That of the superbonus was not an easy theme to dissolve and still remains a theme on which many knots should be loosened The point is that the problem of superbonus is not its cost as someone claims It would be hypocritical to think that If we like the environment we have to spend on the environment Neither are scams which are obviously a problem but could be dealt with with by appropriate controls The problem is the confrontation between two losing ideologies which see us both opposed on the one hand the ideology of bonuses that is free meals on the other hand the ideology of commodity money They 're two ideologies that are both failing In five minutes lucky for you I cannot explain why but what I can say is that when the elections have returned us a more ideologically compact and cohesive government we will remedy the damage these ideologies have created Mr President I am voting in favour of the Lega Salvini Premier Group the Sardinian Action Party
Madam President ladies and gentlemen I will be much shorter than President D'Alfonso Of course President D'Alfonso referred to the European agenda but in my opinion there was not only the European agenda but there was also the agenda of our country This is a measure that has been in progress for a long time and we have been able to hear many experts at the hearing in the course of which we thank for their input I believe that by putting the country at the centre this reform has taken a step forward I have to say this for everyone beyond the demands and political indications of the various groups We put at the centre the taxpayer citizen first of all and then the country system which however is based around a tax process that needed some reforms This is the best reform we could have achieved today and brought to this House at this stage I think that finally the tax judiciary can be and will certainly be more independent it will be dedicated to the tax process without forgetting of course who up to now has provided their service and role within the complicated world that we are going to modify As a citizen even before I was a politician and a representative I am happy to be in front of this reform today because before that something was obviously wrong We obviously continue with the path of changes to allow our country to be at the forefront also compared to other European systems and not only Madam President starting with the conclusion as a lawyer but we have also talked about it in the Commission I believe that more objectives have been achieved and I would like to emphasise some of them as fundamental to the success of the future tax process for all those involved The testimonial before it actually did n't exist Today thanks to the work of all of us the testimonial will finally exist and within the tax process will be a useful tool not only for the magistrate but also for all parts of the trial and for the taxpayer citizen Another important point is the principle of reversal of the burden of proof a delicate principle on which we have discussed and on which we have all found ourselves seeking a sharing through the formulation of an amendment that has been accepted and this to the advantage not of some political part but in this case of the taxpayer it will therefore be the State to have to try more and this must also be specified and emphasized its claim towards the citizen I believe that the commitments entered into with the agendas are also important and must be emphasised And I imagine that will be the subject of an explanation of vote by the Groups Among these I recall for example those who commit the Government I do not know now when it will be time to do so to see recognized protection not only at the stage of the trial but also at the earlier stage of the investigation because something needs to be settled there today too All this system ultimately serves to be more attractive as a country also towards those who look at us from outside and who for example want to come to us to invest But above all it will be in defense of those who today make system in our country invest already in our country and here they intend to stay Then for them just for the citizens and for our country system we carry on this reform and try to improve it also on those points on which we have found a less sharing but still an acceptance through the agendas that we have approved
Mr President representatives of the Government ladies and gentlemen the Senate Act that we are preparing to examine already approved by the House of Deputies contains a delegation to the Government for the reform of the judicial system and for the adaptation of the military judicial system and introduces new immediately preceptive rules on legal organizational and disciplinary matters of eligibility and relocation in the role of judges and of the constitution and functioning of the Supreme Council of the judiciary As for the report from a technical point of view I do not want to bore you and refer you back to the document that I shall deposit However I wanted to make a reflection with you starting from what our President Mattarella also pointed out the Supreme Council of the judiciary is a fundamental garrison wanted by our Constitution to guarantee the independence and autonomy of the judiciary and the judicial order it constitutes an indispensable guarantee in the sphere of democratic balance not in order to favor the condition of the magistrates but in order to ensure that the jurisdiction does not undergo any kind of conditioning Unfortunately the Supreme Council of the judiciary has been overwhelmed by scandals which have shaken the foundations of the justice system Justice is not only judgments measures acts or deadlines but it is much more it represents the level of civilization and testifies to the quality of a state 's democracy There is not only the risk for a more or less limited audience of people perhaps engaged in political activity to end up at the center of extravagant and expensive investigations which eventually only lead to the political murder of those who suffer them There is a serious very serious deficit of democracy within the democratic relations and powers of our country Mr President I would ask you to call my colleagues back
Mr President as I said there is a serious very serious deficit in the relations between the democratic powers of our country Dear colleagues the League is not pointing a finger at anyone it is neither against judges nor against the Government I ask the representatives including the Democratic Party to stop using the measures to plant ideological flags or to create controversy Brusio
Mr President I represent the majority and I said that precisely because of the respect I have for my role and for the justice committee that I am honored to represent I therefore call for all political representatives to respect the work of Parliament and the Commission There has simply been an issue here and we are asking that this House should not run away from the questions of the Italians and the magistrates who work the vast majority of whom work silently It was simply a question of working in the Commission of being free to represent everyone 's ideas within the Commission this is the work that has been done guaranteeing transparency space and therefore work for the benefit of a measure As rapporteur I have done so in the Commission and I do so in this House I would ask Parliament to have the courage to look at the problems and to increase the level of civilisation and the quality of democracy in our country Perhaps it is important for someone to dismiss reforms quickly and I am not referring of course to Minister Cartabia I believe that instead the debate the deepening and the possibility of being free in the work that must be guaranteed in our Parliament are important I believe that reforms like this need to be done well not quickly but well not quickly but with conscience and science I believe that a surplus of deepening as has been requested by many and an effort of dialogue and collaboration are good for this reform for our magistrates for the citizens and also for the future of our country This is the reflection I wanted to make In conclusion I wish the Senate good work so that the debate can be given ample space as we are used to doing for measures that characterize our country in a positive way
"PILON L SP PSd Az Mr President by the spring of 2023 in Britain it will close the gender identity development service of the Tavistock and Portman clinic After access to the files of over 9,000 children treated for gender dysphoria the British government commission put an end to the nightmare of many youngsters including Keira Bell forced to a tortuous useless permanent and life changing path these are the words of the commission Brusio PRESIDENT The debate is closed Ladies and gentlemen there is certainly still a difficult time ahead of us and so the euphoria of the greetings at the end of the sitting I think can be contained So let Senator Pillon continue PILON L SP PSd Az Thank you Mr President The following words have therefore emerged from this committee of inquiry the treatment model used by Tavistock exposes children to a considerable risk of mental discomfort and is not a safe option nor is it practicable to do so It is they are textual words a mass experiment on children What does this have to do with Italy It has to do with it because in Italy there are eight centres including Bologna at the MIT consultory Florence at Chadig Rome at the Saifip Trieste at the Cedig at Burlo Garofolo and Naples at the Federico II University which still practice the same experiments on children undisturbed today With the Parliamentary Committee on Children and Adolescence we have examined this issue in greater depth Mr President the protocols are identical and indeed the directors of these institutes have studied these techniques at Tavistock which has now been closed in Great Britain The question is very simple why do they still go on in Italy with experiments that have been banned in Britain Why are we still administering triptoreline to children Why do we still tell the fairy tale that you can choose which sex to belong to careers aliases devastating surgeries without even parental consent but with the simple consent of the judge to protect These are evident syntomatologies of an ideology that prevails or wants to prevail over reality With the next government we are committed to ending this even in our country"
PILON L SP PSd Az Mr President we have listened to the Minister 's words However we cannot fail to point out to the House that the League had put forward some proposals in the course of its work in the Commission which we believe were essential What I said yesterday I repeat today the reform does not fully satisfy us It is a first timid step much more could be done and in our opinion there were also times to do much more In particular I am referring to an amendment which has a very important character namely the one with which we proposed that Parliament and not the Minister 's secretariat should draw up the electoral tables for the election of the MSC At the time when we delegate to the Ministry the drafting of the tables we dedicate ourselves to those same out of role magistrates whose function has been largely called into question in this House the determination of the electoral districts that will very much then be able to determine for the purposes of election to the MSM You then understand Madam Minister that it would actually save Parliament time because now it will have to be your secretariat that compiles the electoral tables defines the electoral districts and you will not be able to vote for the new MSC until those tables are made At this point it was appropriate to give back to Parliament sovereignty also over the determination of the electoral districts because the times would be essentially the same but in our opinion we would have made a gesture to give back to Parliament that is to say to popular sovereignty a very delicate aspect in relation to the life of the judiciary I wanted to make this example because time is short even if there would be other aspects Too bad That 's what happened I think that the real reform should take place in 2023 when the centre right wins the elections
Mr President Gramsci in the Justice Papers he wrote that the moment of hegemony is essential in his state conception and in the valorisation of a cultural front It can be said that the parties are the computers of the new integral and totalitarian intellectualities To achieve hegemony we need to conquer the areas of greatest cultural influence the school in all its degrees the newspapers the magazines the library activity the educational institutions as well as of course the judiciary These are the Quaderni from Antonio Gramsci 's prison they were written about a hundred years ago The school according to Gramsci together with newspapers magazines library activity and the judiciary is a tool for achieving hegemony And for Gramsci hegemony and totalitarianism are essentially the same thing except for the use of physical violence When the forces inspired by Marxism then communism then democrats then liberals today PD perform hegemony operations such as those we have heard in the intercepts between Palamara Lotti Zingaretti Minniti and many other representatives of PD they do nothing but realize a hegemonic project a strategy written in clear letters a hundred years ago We may not have read Gramsci but I assure you they did Therefore it is eager and also a little naive to take it because the actions of center right government are regularly frustrated by the action of a part of the politicized judiciary The words of Palamara about Salvini which must still be impressed even if it has nothing to do with it resound last but not least even in the last hearings of the Milan classrooms where the umpteenth trial against Silvio Berlusconi is celebrated accused last of immorality that if perhaps it is a sin is certainly not a crime But I tell my colleagues in the Movimento 5 Stars that the same situations were created in the trials against Virginia Rays and against Chiara Appandino Or addressing my colleagues in Italy Viva in trials against Renzi 's parents All trials perhaps concluded with acquittals but which have served in order to cast a shadow on the political opponent This is hegemony elimination of the opponent Totalitarianism did so with prison with the lager with the gulag with the firing squad hegemony does so with the political processes with the media demolition the ridicule of the opponent the instrumental use of education education and culture to give civil death to those who oppose liberal thought The result does n't change When and not a few someone succumbs to suicide in front of such a mass of pressure then crocodile tears flow Some leave politics others are forced to silence the system works very well The problem however ladies and gentlemen and I am addressing above all those who sit behind me is not them At the end of the day they are consistent with themselves they have been pursuing the same strategy for a hundred years The problem is us that is the other political forces Will we or will we not be able to build a regulatory apparatus capable of guaranteeing the independence of one of the most formidable powers that the Leviathan State has demanded for itself namely the judiciary To read this reform honestly ladies and gentlemen I can only respond negatively The steps were shy sometimes useless often facade Sure you could say and we 'll say that it 's better than nothing On the relationship between the judiciary and politics however we did not have the courage to be clear those who enter a party as candidates or elected persons of little importance can no longer be considered impartial Instead we still have revolving doors On the separation of careers Falcone 's words contrary to what Mr Cirinna and Mr Grasso said yesterday in the Commission are very clear and were spoken in 1991 after and not before the 1989 reform Falcone said An accusatory system starts from the assumption of a prosecutor who collects and coordinates the evidence to be reached during the debate where he represents a part in the matter Experience skills skills and preparation including technical skills are therefore needed to pursue the objective The prosecutor in the debate must not have any kind of relationship with the judge and not be as then but even today a kind of parajudice The judge in this picture stands as a neutral uninvolved figure above the parties All this contradicts the fact that having unified training and careers with interchangeable destinations and roles judges and pm are in reality indistinguishable from each other Who like me requires that they be instead two figures structurally differentiated in skills and careers is branded as an enemy of the independence of the magistrate a nostalgic of the discretion of the prosecution eager to place the PM under the control of the Executive It is truly unique that we want to confuse the differentiation of roles and the specialization of PMs with completely distinct institutional issues Instead we more than thirty years after these words still have the two figures completely indistinct and mixed Civil responsibility would be the real reform of the judiciary because it would finally bring the citizen who by profession is the magistrate so he is not a magistrate but he is the magistrate to the same level as all other citizens who do other professions but who are citizens At the end of the day this is the only profession that is in fact completely irresponsible from the economic point of view This can only fuel the risk that this irresponsibility will also involve any other profile After an acquittal after a trial carried out with intent or guilt the wrong party should pay and this does not happen Yet there is no trace of this in the reform despite the 1987 referendum that was won by 80 of the participants who were never transformed into a law That popular will has remained on paper As far as the Supreme Council of the judiciary is concerned it seems clear to me that the only solution in front of chats and dinners at the Champagne Hotel is the draw perhaps temperate The solution proposed by the reform that we are going to vote on presents tables of the electoral districts that will not be written by Parliament either but by chance by those same off the shelf magistrates whose functions we have kept essentially complacent to the currents that will certainly be felt for the definition of electoral colleges In conclusion Mr President are we satisfied No we will do better when we win the lessons next year for now we are content We have tabled amendments to this reform we have maintained them we will vote with conviction and we call on the other political forces to do the same
Mr President I would like to say a few words about Amendment 1.2 which seeks to replace wherever it is reported the expression watercraft with the expression native boat or ship This is because referring exclusively to recreational craft commercial units would be excluded and there would be an unjustified exemption from the penalty With the generic definition of natantante which as we know is the unit up to 10 meters of boat which as we know is the unit from 10 to 24 meters and ship which is the legal definition of unit over 24 meters we have embraced everything that is to be considered naval unit whether commercial or recreational
"PILON L SP PSd Az Mr President boating is one of the sectors in which our country is world class We produce boats boats and ships of excellence but we are also one of the countries that most enjoy the benefits of boating and not only Let 's think about the activities of sport fishing snorkeling diving diving apnea pleasure boating of which I have spoken before but let 's also think about the simple swim that in our almost 9,000 kilometers of coast is always a pleasure to do both in the marine waters and in the inland waters of our lakes and our rivers We are convinced that this law will help to ensure security for this type of activity We are convinced that these rules will increase security in one of the main assets of the country There are stretches of sea coast even lakes and rivers splendid which however are heavily trafficked and which become alas dangerous We have heard the examples that have been made but I believe that each of us has happened at least once in our lives to have a swim and to see a jet ski run very close a dinghy launched at high speed and anything else We must ensure safety including navigation It is true however what Senator Dal Mas said and I agree with that We can't get into panpenalistic thinking It is only with this rule which goes to increase the penalties for anyone committing the crime of manslaughter nautical homicide or manslaughter nautical injuries we have solved the problem It is not the magic wand and I believe that Parliament should take this opportunity to go further into other rules which beyond the criminal dictation help to increase the safety of all those wonderful activities related to the water of the sea the water of our rivers and our lakes We are convinced that from this greater safety of the navigation but also of the enjoyment of our waters will derive a great advantage also for all the sporting enterprises that live of such activity that they live of tourism that they live of fishing that they live of sporting activities tied to navigation Another very important principle which we have reiterated in this regulation and I am convinced that it is important to return to this House is that we do not drive drunk that we do not drive in a state of intoxication or stupefaction Under the effect of psychotropic substances no vehicle is to be driven The life safety and safety of other people and of our person must not be put at risk and this rule reiterates it further Just today in the Childhood Commission we approved the outcome of a survey of young people 's addictions Unfortunately all we have done is to see how there is an increase in addiction to drugs psychotropic substances alcohol This standard gives a clear signal even to young people who might want to take a ride with the jet ski They must know however that they are not driving vehicles that have been altered by alcohol and drugs because this is a risk to their own health and to other people 's health As a League Group we will vote for this rule with conviction I would like to thank as has already been done Senator Balboni who presented this proposal adopted by all political forces in the Justice Commission I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Cucca Mr Ostellari and Mr Sisto who has done so much to get this rule to the House There are two aspects that I would like to explain to my fellow Members before concluding A first aspect which is important to stress is that we took the opportunity to set up two rules of the penal code relating to road traffic which posed serious problems in courtrooms Anyone who has the honour of carrying out the legal profession knows that the reform of road murder and road injuries had two significant limitations a first limit was given by the processability of office of all crimes Those who practice the forensic profession know what we are talking about paradoxically this became a limit At a time when in the face of even minor injuries the criminal proceedings were still open to legal proceedings the offending person was found to have one less weapon in the bargaining with the insurance to obtain a reasonable adequate and short term compensation Returning to the person offended the weapon of the possibility of returning the complaint becomes useful in order to allow the same that is to say those who have suffered injuries illness because of the accident because of others fault to have an additional instrument to obtain the right compensation This is a first rule that we have settled There is a second rule that has been drawn up and that in my opinion it is important that it has been revised by Parliament the one relating to the arrest in flagrante He was conflicting with every common sense rule to provide for the arrest in flagrante for the one who by guilt certainly not by malice had caused of course against his will a car accident and had stopped to ensure immediate help to the victim It is against any logic that that person who has certainly committed a crime and will therefore be judged is dragged away in handcuffs after she has stopped to assist the victim and ensure the immediate arrival of the rescue It is clearly against all common sense besides the fact that that prediction paradoxically favored escape because rather than being arrested at that point someone had the unhealthy temptation to flee to get away If this rule is also approved by the House and we are convinced that this will happen finally the person who caused the sinister as it is will not be arrested in flagency if however he stops to provide assistance to call the rescue will wait for their arrival and will give the necessary help to the offended person This is clearly an incentive to put an end to the terrible phenomenon of road accidents with the escape of the one who caused them I therefore believe that this is a very common sense rule which goes to heal a vulnus I 'll stop here ma'am I can only hope that the House of Deputies will have time to finally approve this draft law in this part session"
PILON L SP PSd Az Mr President on 28 July 2017 all of us remember Charlie Gard died at 11 months Although his parents had asked the British High Court to save his life he was ordered to detach the machines that kept him alive On April 28 2018 Alfie Evans a nearly two year old child died For him too the sentence of the British High Court was death as the best interest of the minor It was useless to collect signatures it was useless to grant Italian citizenship for this child The judges wrote that he had a futile life Today however we are celebrating an event that is important let 's remember a British girl Tafida Raqeeb was hospitalized in 2019 at the Royal London Hospital in London in an irreversible coma and for her too we risked the detachment of the machines that kept her alive Already the NHS Trust and the doctors had arranged to stop the treatment However the mother Mrs. Shelina Begum lawyer as well as of Islamic religion appealed to the British High Court and in October 2019 the British High Court changed its jurisprudence and authorized the transfer of the child to Italy The child was hospitalized at the Gaslini hospital in Genoa and was subjected to the necessary medical treatments Today that little girl whom the British doctors and judges had given for death is not only alive but is in sharp improvement in 2020 she left the intensive care and improves from day to day This is an Italian excellence of which we should be proud Our country has shown that it is able to take care of children even those given for doomed and this must give us a great warning to save life always On March 22nd in London I will be present at the launch of the foundation Tafida Raqeeb dedicated to all children who are given for dealing and for whom there is and must be hope

Mr President ladies and gentlemen allow me first of all to address an important issue It is right to speak in times of foreign policy crisis and we are doing so today for very dangerous action However it would be nice if this House were more often involved in talking about foreign policy The last time this happened with regard to the Afghan situation and today we are talking about Ukraine I think that the size of a country is measured by foreign policy Perhaps in this House we could talk more about finding solutions and ideas to suggest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and President Draghi because it is through these choices that the greatness of our country is determined I was very pleased when President Draghi was very determined determined and pragmatic in defending President Ursula von der Leyen with regard to the Turkish question with a test of international diplomacy and decision of our country In these moments we feel proud to belong to a country that wants to be respected also abroad We come to the current situation the economy has just started again starting again after two difficult years But there is also great competition on raw materials a very important arms race tension in the East China Sea and the crisis in Ukraine We need to be clear about what is going on and then we need to give answers I have heard many judgments from my fellow Members today I believe however that sometimes ruling and expressing judgments also block diplomacy You Minister said that diplomacy even ours is doing a great job I am very happy and thank all our diplomats and staff who are working to find a solution As you said we must use diplomacy a lot and be pragmatic in order to avoid a conflict which I hope not could be at home I think in short as a first point that none of us are in favour of war Today unanimously we are all opposed to any act of war all of us in this House but also in the real world of our country The second point is that the vast majority of this House as well as my own personal view and my Group believe that since it is in the Atlantic Pact it must be respected Thirdly however we must listen to and understand the will of the peoples who must be respected as the UN stated in 1966 with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which was adopted in our country in 1976 I was taking into account the actors in the current situation and their different and opposing interests We have Italian interests those of America Russia Europe the countries of the Atlantic Pact Ukraine and then also the interests of the people of Crimea and Donbass There are various actors and when one makes diplomacy express as I heard today certain sentences do not help It is necessary to find the synthesis of the various interests the meeting point We must put ourselves in the shoes of those actors in order to find the synthesis and avoid something absolutely disastrous that could be war but it could also be equally disastrous the economic sanctions on which the country will naturally decide I do n't mean we 're against it and it 's war data However we must also consider the repercussions of these sanctions It is easy for those who sign them to set sanctions but then they have repercussions in the real country they have repercussions in the people of companies perhaps employees of entrepreneurs companies that close precisely because they suffer their consequences The country will decide but we are careful to establish sanctions reasoning also in the interest of our country Minister in conclusion for our part great space and great work to diplomacy in order to be able to listen to all the actors I have listed before certainly I have forgotten some of them limiting myself to the most important ones in order to find a solution that is good for all the countries concerned
VESCOVI L SP PSd Az Mr President first of all I would like to invite everyone to see an extraordinary city like Pistoia because it is very beautiful and very alive I remember that when I went to live in Pistoia in 2005 I immediately found a very lively city with a beautiful landscape I arrived at the very moment when we were going to prepare the Pistoia Blues Festival so I was really impressed that the city is carrying out an international event one of the most important at European level but recognized worldwide I am therefore very happy for the final approval of the bill under consideration with which we recognize the city of Pistoia forty years of work and presentation of the Pistoia Blues Festival This festival is promoted on two sides on the one hand it promotes the traditions and culture of the territory not only of the city but of the same Region which lives the event on the other hand it promotes music Just at this time when music in certain fringes has also helped us comforted and made us live emotions we must be very close to all the artists to all the musicians and to all those who work in that sector that in recent years have certainly suffered so also to them will be dedicated our favorable vote The festival also serves as a laboratory to help introduce new talents to see the growth of those who face the world of music even with educational activities Allow me to thank the Minister the Undersecretary Lucia Borgonzoni to whom we truly thank having fought for this bill as well as the senators of Pistoia the city of Pistoia expresses five senators in this legislature some in majority others in opposition who have remained united for the good of the city and this is their honor This is due to a battle that we are carrying out for autonomy for federalism for the valorisation of realities To make our country great we should value it as we are doing for all our cities in this way we will develop it We therefore need to recognise a great deal of value to autonomy and federalism and this is proof of it I also thank Senators Saponara and Alessandrini who with their agenda say that the positive work for Pistoia must be done for other festivals and other competitions that deserve it I conclude by announcing the vote in favour of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione
VESCOVI L SP PSd Az Mr President I speak only to bring to the attention of the House a beautiful gesture of humanity and love made in Tuscany in Florence by Chiara Fossombroni a woman a mother who decided to take care of a child left by her parents at the Meyer hospital He was a child of a few months whose life was already destined unfortunately to death so much so that he died a few days ago However she decided to take him in foster care to follow him and make him live through small gestures but very important that should make us all reflect like seeing the sea or touching the grass They are small gestures that have great significance all the more so at such a difficult time for Italy for Europe and the whole world For my part and for the whole Group I offer my condolences to my mother Chiara Fossombroni and a greeting to little Kaif
Mr President I think we are all for peace and none of us are for war We are working precisely to achieve peace as soon as possible also thanks to our diplomacy Coming to the point of the Ukraine decree Mr President I have always asked myself a question The issue in that area has been known since 2014 since then we have certainly not made a policy of diversification so much so that today 40 of the gas the European Union imports it from Russia financing it We must therefore be careful on the one hand to put sanctions rightly but on the other hand we remember that the European Union today buys 40 of gas from Russia Maybe all these not from the last ten years no to the TAP no to the TAV no to everything have led us to this situation of dependence on Russia Our country needs a vision also as a policy of gas and energy We must have a propensity for the future be able to talk to yeses and give a vision of the next ten years Otherwise we will find ourselves as today always with a decree Ukraine and always living in urgency With urgency however we do not build a great country The second point which I raised also through a question is that Italy is lucky even at a geographical level to be at the centre of the Mediterranean We must therefore begin to have this vision and also relations with North Africa with countries from which to import gas in order not to be a hostage of a single nation We must also be able to find solutions within our country and to have relations with the Balkan countries I put a question about fifteen days ago about the electricity pipeline that connects Italy with Montenegro where there is already a structure and a cable that imports electricity It would take a second to double the electricity to import into our country To start having these vision and visional relationships which also lead us to connections with all the Balkan countries in this specific case with Montenegro for us could be one of the solutions a little on one side and a little on the other it is better to diversify and not have a single important supplier Mr President allow me then to take a political step The size of a country is measured by its foreign policy We are all seeing in the newspapers that a passage is taking place in Turkey to find a diplomatic route between Ukraine and Russia I would have liked this passage to have taken place in our country since we have a very important class of ambassadors to whom I commend because together with all our staff abroad they are truly extraordinary people However this is not the case I would like to ask the Foreign Minister a question in the sense of a reflection are the terms he is using which I have heard in some television broadcasts adequate to achieve an important diplomatic route between Ukraine and Russia We are trying to become the diplomatic reference point in order to find a solution between the two states
Mr President ladies and gentlemen we are faced with a really necessary decree- law because at the moment I think that all Italians are waiting for it to be able to resolve so many of the situations that we have faced with the dear raw materials I will explain some of the speeches that have been developed within the competence of our Commission I think for example to a very important amendment that aims to stimulate the railway traffic of the goods in harbour within previewing the possibility to decrease the canons of the state property concessions on which the terminalistiche activities insist favoring in this way a sustainable transport thanks to the use of the trains with consequent decrease of the emissions of CO2 and the congestion of the roads in the reference areas This is an important amendment that was so much awaited especially with regard to port areas Then there is another very important amendment In these months we have been faced with the dearness of materials linked to the difficulty of finding raw materials In the construction sector whole yards especially now that we are facing the shipyards of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan but also at private yards we cannot find materials especially as regards the insulation they do not arrive and consequently the yard stops and there are completely insane prices which obviously blow up all the financial plans Hence the great importance of an amendment to which I was first a signatory the extension of the building permits in order to allow more space for businesses and private citizens who are currently in a difficult position to close the yards with the deadlines of the licences I think this is a very important measure that we have managed to bring home Then there is the whole issue that has not been completely resolved it will probably find solution in the next measure on the prices to be referred to for construction works which are to be adapted if we had already had an updated price list in January of this year at this date in May it would have been completely out of phase However it is regrettable that an amendment did not end well We are faced with a forecast of 500 million for the fund of the hauliers relative to the goods section Since this sector is currently suffering mainly from expensive fuel excise duties and so on it is very good that there is this fund However one very important category has been forgotten the one relating to passenger transport I am thinking of the tourist buses for example but also the transport of people in general which also find themselves having to fight every day against expensive fuel and even if they have invested in innovative means they find themselves with methane and gas skyrocketing Let us not forget that this category has suffered the consequences of lockdown the stopping of all trips and I am referring not only to school ones but to all in general it has suffered a reduction in capacity to 50 for almost two years and now it is facing the expensive fuels so it really does not manage to move forward So what we asked the government was only the symbolic gesture to remember this really important category which contains so many jobs but it has serious difficulties and so we cannot forget them Soon we will find ourselves to examine another decree law always relative to the question of the excises that it already contains an article on the road haulage and a decree transports I therefore hope after what has happened at this stage that this problem will find a solution
Mr President first of all I should like to thank Deputy Minister Bellanova for the support he has given at this time on a rather complicated measure but at the same time he has had a good development thanks to all the members of the 8th Commission to the Group leaders to the President and to the Commission 's legislative offices which have done a great deal The draft law of governmental initiative consists of a single article and gives a delegation to the Government to adopt within six months one or more legislative decrees with the discipline of public contracts The purpose of the draft law consisting of a single article is to simplify rationalise and reorder the rules on public contracts and to avoid the initiation of infringement procedures by the European Commission and to reach the resolution of those already initiated The draft law lists the principles and guiding criteria to be followed by the Government and among them the need to avoid gold plating the forecasting and redefinition of the qualification of the contracting stations and their staff the simplification of the rules applicable to public contracts for works services and supplies exceeding the thresholds of European relevance the simplification of procedures for the realisation of investments in green digital innovation and research technologies including for the achievement of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the reduction and certainty of the time limits for the tendering and conclusion of contracts and the execution of contracts the revision and simplification of the procedures for the approval of projects in the field of public works the incentive for the use of flexible procedures for the conclusion of complex public contracts of long duration the simplification of the extension of public private partnership forms with particular regard to project finance the identification of public contracts excluded from the scope of the European directives and the simplification of the legal discipline applicable to them the prohibition of the extension of the arrangements for the extension of public private partnership with regard to the implementation of contracts for the implementation of contracts for the purposes of which have been extended and the implementation of contracts to be subject to be subjected the implementation of contracts for the implementation of contracts which have been subjected and the implementation of the implementation of contracts with regard to be subject to be subject to the conditions of the conditions of contracts for the conditions of contracts for granting to which have been subject to be extended the conditions of contracts for the conditions for granting to be extended and to be extended to be extended the implementation of contracts for granting of contracts for granting of contracts for granting of contracts for granting to be subject to be subject to be subject to which have been concluded the conditions of contracts for granting of contracts for granting the conditions of contracts for granting the conditions of contracts for granting the conditions of contracts for the conditions of contracts for granting to be subject to which have been extended the conditions of contracts for granting to be subject to be subject to be subject to which have been concluded the conditions of contracts for the conditions of contracts for granting to be subject to be subject to be subject to be extended the conditions of contracts for granting to be determined the conditions for granting the conditions of contracts for granting to be determined the implementation the implementation the implementation of contracts for granting the conditions of contracts for granting the conditions of contracts for granting of contracts for granting of contracts and It is established that the legislative decrees thus adopted expressly repeal all the provisions under review and in any case those related to them incompatible and make appropriate coordination provisions in relation to provisions not repealed or not modified The thorough work carried out by the 8th Commission on this measure which began last autumn included a comprehensive round of hearings of the main players in the sector and led to the adoption of 83 amendments which together made some 30 amendments to the text This amending activity was inspired by a method shared in the Commission in the early stages of the debate aimed at meeting the need to define more precisely the principles and guiding criteria of the delegation with the intention not to overburden the text In the course of the examination in particular some issues have emerged which have seen a broad convergence of the majority groups often even with the opposition in a fruitful dialogue with the Government Firstly the need to encourage the participation of micro small and medium sized enterprises has been shared by including an indication in this respect already in the first steering criterion and then introducing a specific steering criterion aimed at providing for the possibility of dividing contracts on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria and the prohibition of artificial aggregation of lots in line with the principles of small business act also in order to enhance the value of neighbouring companies Another theme that given the particular historical moment we are experiencing could not but be the subject of particular attention is that of the price review The wording on which it was finally possible to agree provides for the requirement for contracting stations to include in calls for tenders notices and invitations in relation to the different types of public contracts a compulsory price review regime when particular conditions of an objective and non-predictive nature occur at the time the tender is made establishing that any charges arising from the above mentioned price review mechanism are based on the resources available from the economic framework of the interventions and on any other resources available for the purchasing station to be used in accordance with the accounting procedures for expenditure Another issue on which wide convergence has been observed has been the prohibition for contracting stations with reference to contracts below the thresholds of European importance to use for the selection of operators to be invited to the negotiated procedures the draw or other random method of names if not in the case of specific or specifically motivated situations Scrolling through the regulatory article among the various changes made there are also the following with reference to the prohibition of gold plating it has been specified that the unrogability of measures to protect the work safety the contrast to irregular work legality and transparency remains firm A reference to the different types of public contracts has been inserted regarding the redefinition of the secondary discipline regime As regards the qualification of contracting stations a reference has been inserted to the monitoring of the aggregation and reorganisation of contracting stations and the forecast of specific training courses with particular reference to the single contracting stations and the purchasing power stations operating at the service of local authorities A new letter was inserted to promote in compliance with European law the use by contracting stations of supplies in that part of products originating in third countries which make up the offer which is not major in relation to the total value of the products New guiding principles with respect to the original text concern the rationalization and simplification of the causes of exclusion in order to make clear and certain the rules of participation the provision in the case of entrusting the tasks of design to internal staff to contracting authorities of the signing of specific insurance policies for the coverage of risks of a professional nature with burdens on the same administrations the definition of the rules applicable to public contracts in the field of research and development services As regards the qualification of operators a reference has been inserted to the adequacy of technical equipment and staff The Commission has also introduced a new delegation criterion aimed at redefining the rules governing the variants in progress within the limits laid down by the European law in relation to the possibility of amending contracts during the implementation phase Another novelty compared to the original draft law concerns the revision of the rules on social services hospital welfare and school catering as well as labour intensive ones providing as a criterion that can be used for the purposes of the award only that of the most economically advantageous offer The Commission also considered it appropriate to mention in the text framework agreements service concessions the financial lease of public works or utilities A revision of the guarantee system for the participation and execution of public contracts was also envisaged providing for the possibility in relation to the guarantees for the execution of contracts to replace them by carrying out a guarantee withholding proportionate to the amount of the contract at the time of the payment of each progress of the works In the field of concessions it is expected that concessions in place and not entrusted with the form of project finance i.e. with public evidence tendering procedures in accordance with European Union law with specific regard to the situations in which there is an obligation in accordance with criteria of graduality and proportionality and taking into account the size characteristics of the concessionaire the time of allocation of the concession its duration the object and its economic value to entrust to third parties through public evidence procedures part of the contracts of works services and supplies relating to the same concessions ensuring the stability of the staff employed and the safeguarding of professionalism Finally a new delegation criterion has been introduced specifically dedicated to the simplification of payment procedures by contracting stations of the contract fee including by reducing the administrative burden on businesses
PERGREFFI L SP PSd Az Mr President Valerio Carrara was a man tied to his land to Val Brembana to his country Oltre Il Colle where he was mayor for ten years In the thirteen years of parliamentary activity he has never spared himself in doing the good of people with passion and in carrying forward the demands of the mountain and its great passion hunting The hunting had made him one of the most authoritative references of the hunting world in Parliament not surprisingly he was also provincial councillor of the Italian Federation of hunting At the same time as his years in the Senate he lived the role of mayor of Oltre Il Colle where he was elected for two terms until 2017 a position that made him stay close to the local people and administrators without forgetting its origins those of the mountain He was a lover of nature open spaces horses sports and in particular enduro a very strong tradition in the Bergamo valleys For its territory for the development of the Val Brembana for years it tried in vain to urge the reopening of the casino of San Pellegrino just to revive the tourism in the valley He leaves us a man from the mountain a man from his valley a man who has never lost his roots and who saw in politics the opportunity to give voice to the territory The entire League Group and especially the Bergamo senators join in the moment of the family 's pain I would therefore like to thank you Mr President for your kind words and I would also like to join in the words of all my fellow Members who have spoken before me I think Valerio will remain a very important man for Bergamo
Mr President I would like to thank Mr Morelli and Ms Bini for their help as well as the rapporteurs Mr Paroli and Mr Santillo and the President of the Commission for their work I would like to highlight something that is happening today in the world of infrastructure there are rumours that very soon perhaps even today the guidelines on infrastructure controls will be published which will prevent if confirmed the passage on infrastructure over 40 tonnes If so be careful because in the next few days we will have the blockade of the country and we will find ourselves quietly greeting the PNRR Therefore I ask you to pay the utmost attention on this topic and take advantage of a passage within the decree infrastructures to start to point out that if this happened we would really find ourselves with the country completely blocked because the 40 tons and perhaps the responsibility of the local authorities on the individual infrastructures would really be a heavy load also for what concerns our local and provincial administrators
Mr President first of all I would like to stress my thanks to Mr Bellanova who as always was present in the proceedings and to the rapporteur Senator Cioffi for the work he has done We are at the third reading the draft law on public contracts approved by this House on 9 March and then amended to the House of Deputies returns to the Senate First the House intervened on two provisions inserted by the Senate at first reading to protect small and medium sized enterprises In point a of paragraph 2 it has been specified that the opening of competition to the competitive comparison between the different operators must concern in particular in addition to small and medium sized enterprises also micro-enterprises In addition the guiding principle set out in point d inserted by this branch of Parliament in order to encourage the participation of micro and small enterprises has been supplemented by the provision of premium criteria for the aggregation of undertakings as well as the obligation to justify the decision not to divide into lots by the contracting station In point a it was also stated that when implementing the delegation account should also be taken of the specific nature of contracts in the special sectors with the aim of enhancing the specific nature of such contracts The Chamber then introduced the new governing criterion referred to in point b aimed at the revision of the competences of the DAC in the matter of public contracts in order to strengthen its functions of supervision in the field and of support to the contracting stations Also with regard to the competences of the DAC in point m it was also provided that the authority would prepare standard contracts after consulting the Council of Public Works regarding the contracts type of works and services of engineering and architecture Among the principles to be respected in contracts under threshold was also that of rotation in the procedures of choice of the contractor The simplification of procedures for the realisation of investments in green and digital technologies as well as in innovation and research as provided for in point f has been accompanied by procedures for the realization of investments in social innovation Among the conditions of an objective nature not foreseeable at the time of the formulation of the offer which determine the revision of the prices pursuant to point g the variation of the cost resulting from the renewal of the national collective agreements of employment applicable in relation to the object of the contract and the services to be followed also in a prevailing way has been expressly included In point h first it was provided that contracting stations should be given the right to participate in procurement procedures and concession procedures for economic operators whose main purpose is the social and professional integration of persons with disabilities or disadvantaged persons A reference to disadvantaged people has also been included with regard to equal opportunities under 3 Secondly the mandatory inclusion of social clauses to guarantee and not only to promote as the original text of the draft law stated the employment stability of employees Similarly in point v it has been provided that in the case of social services and catering in hospitals hospitals and schools as well as those with a high labour density invitations to tender notices and invitations must contain the provision of specific social clauses aimed at promoting the employment stability of the staff employed In the case of supplies from non-EU countries measures should be taken to ensure compliance with minimum environmental criteria workers rights including in order to ensure fair competition with economic operators in European countries The new governing criterion referred to in point l shall prohibit the free provision of professional activities except in exceptional cases and subject to appropriate reasons The House then reworded the guiding criterion on the simplification of the phase of approval of the projects in letter q making the redefinition of the design levels more binding in order to reduce them In point aa on the rationalisation simplification and extension of forms of public private partnership the forecast of standard contracts has also been included In the field of integrated procurement in point ee it has been clarified that the necessary qualification for the preparation of the projects remains firm as well as the obligation to indicate in the tender documents or invitations how the contracting company pays directly to the designer the proportion of the compensation corresponding to the design charges expressly indicated in the tender of the economic operator net of the auction reduction this was a great battle carried out by the Commission here in the Senate An explicit reference to the acceleration of the procedures was added to the governing criterion for the simplification of the procedures for the payment of the contract by the contracting stations introduced in the text during the examination of the Senate Finally with reference to the procedure for adopting the legislative decrees implementing the delegation paragraph 4 has been clarified that as usual the Chambers will express themselves on the relative schemes after the Council of State and the unified Conference have expressed themselves The Commission in its analysis has not made any further changes considering that the two previous readings have enabled a good balance to be achieved as the adoption of the measure under consideration by 30 June constitutes one of the PNRR 's objectives for 2022 PRESIDENT The debate is I call the rapporteur Senator Cioffi
Mr President I would just like to point out to this House that as far as the maximum reduction is concerned which has been the subject of Senator De Bertoldi 's intervention it has been made clear within the delegation law that there will be an identification of the hypotheses in which contracting stations can use automation in the assessment and typing of cases where they can only use the price or cost criterion with the possibility of excluding anonymous offers in any case and providing in any case that the costs of labour and safety must always be disembedded by the amounts subject to decrease I think that a clearer prediction of this cannot be written within a delegated law so it seems to me that the concerns of Senator De Bertoldi are protected from this point of view Even with regard to exclusion from calls for tender much work has been done within the Commission in the Senate still rationalising and simplifying the rules which must be clear and certain for the identification of the cases that constitute the wrongdoing Therefore from this point of view too I think that we can be satisfied with the way Parliament has worked and in this case the Senate I also remember that everything about the procurement code is necessary all the more so today that we are facing challenges as has been reiterated in some speeches We really hope that the bureaucratic passages can be simplified and brought back to a certain time as business demands Moreover this demand comes not only from companies but also from our administrations I am thinking above all of the smaller municipalities Certain times are needed with regard to bureaucracy without forgetting that the economic recovery of Italy certainly passes from the great interventions but also from the small interventions that will be on our territory I therefore believe that this is a great opportunity a great opportunity and I really think that what has been done in the Senate and in the House is a good job and I really hope as has been said before that these hopes will be realized in the implementing decrees
"Mr President we are dealing with the conversion into law of the Decree Law on urgent measures to counter the economic and humanitarian effects of the crisis in Ukraine In order to face this international crisis a series of provisions are introduced by the Decree Law in question to meet the exceptional requirements in particular with regard to the performance of production activities to contain energy prices on the Italian market and to face the situation of instability in the functioning of the national natural gas system resulting from the Russian Ukrainian conflict Although the work in the Commission has been very intensive tiring and full bodied more than 1,421 amendments have been produced by all the parliamentary groups and the League is satisfied although not entirely because more can be done The work of our Group has been strong and important on a number of themes We are a little disappointed by small signals that the Government could perhaps have given us about situations that seem small to us but they are great for the various sectors I am referring for example to the amendment which allocated very small funds to rehabilitation centres for disabled people with heated pools used for physiotherapy and rehabilitation in the water then there was our amendment against the cutting of the military which was rejected after a negative opinion from the Government The reduction expected from the next 1° July of another 1,000 units from the Safe Roads operation is a serious damage to our country As a League we will continue to fight for the Forces of Order and for the safety of the Italians In addition the government could accept our amendment on extra profits to banks We had strongly asked to expand the audience of the subjects called to pay the extraordinary contribution against the expensive bills A concrete act of social redistribution was needed increasing the taxation of extra-profits from 10 to 25 and extending it also to banks and financial intermediaries operating in the energy sector If our amendment had been approved and accepted by the Government it would have guaranteed revenues to the State and consequently the distribution of profits to millions of Italians but also to cover the burdens to remove the distorting effects contained in the norm that penalize several companies It would have been a gesture of social justice a fair and necessary measure to reduce the costs of expensive energy and to help families and businesses It is also true however that other small great signs have arrived thanks to the work done by the Lega Group with the rest of the majority and the insistence of our party amendments have been accepted which at this time of serious post Pandemic crisis really help our citizens I am referring in particular I thank Giorgio Bergesio and the Group to the payment of fines from milk quotas a very important measure In addition we can be satisfied with the approval of the amendment in defence of our companies with regard to the exports of scrap with which the number of subjects obliged to transmit the export information to the Ministry of Economic Development which can carry out a clear monitoring for all the companies that want to export including those foreign ones This is an initiative that serves to protect our productive realities from unfair market practices that would put in serious difficulty entire sectors from construction to steelmaking with heavy consequences for our companies and social and employment repercussions Another concrete response to entrepreneurs who still struggle to recover from the health and economic emergency and who forcefully ask us not to be left alone in the post Pandemic restart is the approval of the amendment that allows for example bars restaurants and public establishments in general already considered suitable to continue after payment to enjoy outdoor tables and chairs throughout the summer season without having to produce any new request and without the municipal authorities being able to deny it This will also serve to lighten the municipal administrations themselves as well as the development of our activities We are proud of these and many other results the result of negotiations with the majority of the Government on which I am sure we could not have affected by remaining in opposition Mr President I would like to conclude my speech on an issue which as a Puglia citizen interests me directly and which concerns me very much which concerns the former Ilva It is not possible I say this to the comrades of this wide ranging government path for the PD to support an initiative of the Movimento 5 Stars trying to vote on that amendment on the former Ilva in the Commission which fortunately has not passed with the opposite opinion from the Ministry of Economic Development only for pure demagogy as it appears clear from the press news of the last hours yesterday and today It is clear that the delays in reclamation operations it should be clarified in the areas of the former Ilva can be attributed to those who have the competence to do so i.e. to the administration of the Commission which we did not put The funds for this are there the money for the reclamations is there but the commissioners are not carrying out the project and everything goes very slowly The rule approved in the decree has been widely discussed with the Presidency of the Council and with all parties of this majority present in the direction booth The objective of the Government and Minister Giorgetti is to accelerate the process of decarbonisation which is necessary in the interest of the city of Taranto aimed at efficient productivity of a key sector of our economy especially in this historical period with the increase of prices and the lack of raw materials"
Mr President I would like to thank Mr Bellanova for his presence not only today but also during these days that we have been particularly involved in the Commission Before going into the substance of the measure I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the members of the 8th Commission who in a constructive and frank discussion have addressed the complex issue of delegation to the Government in the field of public contracts Above all I extend a special thanks to the two speakers Senator Pergreffi and Senator Cioffi who even before being elected representatives of the sovereign people are above all an expression of architecture and civil engineering so they are endowed with great competence and professionalism Our contribution to simplifying the rules governing public contracts aims to ensure clarity and support for our productive activities I have the great honour to be a signatory together with my colleagues from the League and the entire Commission of amendments that protect Made in Italy in public supplies guaranteeing a majority share of Italian products compared to those from other non-EU countries Indeed the opportunity to relaunch the European funds and the current crisis of our companies had made urgent action to limit the influx into the European markets of products from non-EU countries at low cost and therefore of poor material We have clarified and made more understandable to entrepreneurs the rules that constitute the professional wrongdoing and the reasons that could exclude companies from the bans With the particular sensitivity that characterizes us as League on the territories we have obtained the possibility to divide or to group the contracts in lots This will benefit both in terms of greater market access by small businesses and in terms of the protection of companies operating in a given territory thus enhancing those of proximity For another amendment there is also a success i.e. the mandatory constraint on the review of prices in particular situations This is a great result in order to compare costs to the real development of the market This is an important support for local businesses which will thus be in a position to cope with exceptional and unpredictable situations such as those we have unfortunately been living for months The revision of prices in fact during the execution of the contract proves necessary in order to maintain the mutual balance between the contractor and the performer and thus gives the possibility to the enterprises to make congruent offers safeguarding the principle of healthy and fair competition Moreover during the examination a new discipline of the use of the draw has passed which thanks to the League will have to be strongly limited and regulated because it is a mechanism that degrades the qualification acquired by the enterprises In addition we are also proud of an approved amendment which provides for insurance policies to be borne by contracting stations to cover professional risks in favour of staff employed by contracting stations which was not taken for granted Thus their costs will be borne by the contracting stations themselves Finally two agendas were also accepted by the League and three other important Commission agendas which as the Lega Group we have signed They provide by the Government the commitment to provide for a review of the tariffs of the companies certification body the so called SOA to enhance the experience of the technical director of the works to regulate the theme of fair compensation for professionals engaged in public contracts to timely implement an Italian digital platform of constructions and to provide for the simplification of anti-mafia checks I agree with the words spoken by my friend Senator Paroli just now because it is clear that Parliament despite the work that has been done in the Commission and despite the concrete results that have been achieved must return to being an active part of the legislation and must not derogate from other bodies the task for which we have been elected However I can say that we are proud to have brought these results home which are concrete the result of negotiations with the majority and with the government And it turns out the League could n't have gotten by the opposition
"CORTI L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Pucciarelli the Undersecretary and the rapporteur Senator Vattuone as well as to our Parent Company in the Defence Commission his friend and colleague Massimo Candura for the patience and mediation capacity he has found with all the members of the Defence Commission Dear colleagues the measure that we will shortly vote I hope unanimously is a source of great emotion for me not only because by fatality we are discussing it on the 150th anniversary of the birth of the Alpine Corps but also because it anticipates the 93rd event of the National Alpine Association ANA in Rimini by an exact month I believe that with the vote in favour of this House the more than 200,000 alpine people who are going to do so on 8 May will do so even more head to head and proud of the institutions For a senator and a mountaineer like me raised on bread and alpine this is an unforgettable day I have the great fortune not only to be a descendant of an alpine family but above all to be part of the great Alpine family which I have been very close to since the age of nine when my grandfather involved me in the social activities of the alpine group of my country Montefiorino I am so attached to this Corps that I still feel sorry for not being judged fit for military service As a partner ANA a friend of the Alps however I have never been burdened and proudly when possible cross referenced with my group While my appeal was still pending on the Senate I asked Modena deputy Golinelli whom I thank to present to the House this bill then approved there unanimously in June 2019 I must say that it was not easy to identify the two important words that grasped its meaning memory and sacrifice We talk about memory because it is a specialty of the Alpines with territorial recruitment which immediately became the pride of the mountain people and the valleyrs who fed it with their best youth The Alpines have not forgotten this when they returned home from military service and have always maintained that bond of friendship and fraternity with the comrades For this reason in almost every village and fraction of our Alpine and Apennine valleys stands an ANA headquarters where the former conscripts were able to continue to remain at the service of their community Then there is the word sacrifice which is the thing that the Alpines since their foundation have always known and respected without fear Those who live in the mountains and in the inland areas know well what it is even in the common life even today from agriculture to school from road to communications The alpine sacrifice has proved it in all the wars in which they participated but they have demonstrated it even more in all the activities of volunteering and civil protection in which they are worthy of admiration We now come to the date of the celebration on January 26 of each year the unfortunate date although it was that of a battle at Nikolajewka is the synthesis of what are the words memory and sacrifice that is the spirit of fraternity On January 26 1943 the now exhausted Alpine troops of the Tridentina division and the disbanded Alpines of the Julia and Cuneense divisions found themselves in front of the Russian barrier of Nikolajewka These troops had been surrounded and then sacrificed a month earlier on the banks of the Don to allow the withdrawal of what remained of the Armir but also of Germans Romanians and Hungarians overwhelmed by Operation Piccolo Saturn At the time of the retreat order the alpines still counted 52,000 actual men who though surrounded and without hope had held the positions assigned to them until that fateful January 17 1943 when they began their terrible advance backwards which lasted nine days with twenty five battles of breakout and rearguard By opening the way the Tridentina division thanks also to the sacrifice of the sister divisions Julia and Cuneense transformed the retreat into the most unstoppable and tragic advance in enemy territory that has ever been seen In inhuman conditions due to lack of food and shelter with very little ammunition without means of transport if not sleds attached to the faithful mules with temperatures of 40 degrees below zero the alpines saved their lives to themselves and to a mass of Italian German Romanian and Hungarian prisoners released and aggregated in the long column If these Alpines had no memory of their distant homes their families and their country they would not have found the necessary strength if they had not had a spirit of sacrifice the wounded would not have put themselves on their shoulders they would not have divided the little food left with all the sloppers who sat down to the long column and could not have shown themselves to the fatal clash of Nikolajewka which allowed 13,240 men to come out of the bag Mario Rigoni Stern wrote pages that I believe all of us have had the opportunity to appreciate in which we read the despair but at the same time also the humanity of that January 26 Alpini rescued by a companion officers who die at the head of their men waiters who stop to weep them they are just some of the episodes of that tragic battle of Nikolajevka which culminates in the scene of General Reverberi commander of the Tridentina who climbed on the last remaining semountant leads the crucial battle and personally guides the survivors to the assault Let me read the poem of Lieutenant Nelson Cenci of the 2nd Alpine Artillery Regiment Vicenza A sunrise that had hope in the soul of the sun For vast pastures of snow under a death plowing sky on your bumps the audacity to seek life was worn out several times Only at the end of the day with desperate cry epic host of ghosts passed through half a murmur of prayers Now the sun goes down on the top of the ridge bathing with light your dead and in a wind of clouds your lonely weeping to distant heavens flees No more harsh lands and mountain profiles in their glass eyes but long mute rows of men on ice trails The track is made of stars and moon crystals turn off on miserable unnamed crosses The tragic epic of the Alpine Corps however does not end that evening on January 26 1943 but only when the survivors always reach Shebekino on foot on January 31 On February 3 the day of San Biagio on the radio Benito Mussolini announces that only 10,000 Alpines have come out of the bag and February 8 the statement n. 630 of the Red Army declares that only the Alpine Corps must be considered unbeaten in the land of Russia On March 6 1943 the translations that brought the survivors of the Alpine Corps back to Italy began from Gomel on the 15th the last convoy left and on March 24 all were in the Homeland As the friend and colleague Senator Gasparri already recalled the numbers were inclement only 6,400 of the Tridentine 3,300 of the Julia and 1,300 of the Cuneense saved and came out of the bag The tragic retreat of Russia ended mockingly for the alpine people when they returned to their homeland Few know this but at the station in Merano where they expected to be received as heroes by the same bands that with great ceremony had greeted them the year before the departure the local authorities had the anti-aircraft alarm sounded because it was better that the population did not see the pitiful state of the veterans frozen mutilated wounded without shoes and with the uniforms to shreds This however is now history the one that the veterans told the new levers in the ANA locations of our valleys together with that art of arranging that a bit distinguishes us mountainers And in the same places where the last veterans of the Great War were venerated by the veterans of the Second we younger ones learned what the great alpine family was the one that never leaves anyone behind and takes off the sled a box of ammunition and loads a wounded man In these locations in addition to the unmissable books by Mario Rigoni Stern and Giulio Bedeschi there are always hundreds of photographs that testify to that tragic retreat Today alongside the men and women in service in the Alpine Corps the hundreds of thousands of black pens have been on leave for a century now making the National Alpine Association with its 350,000 members the largest gun association in the country a living and vital presence where the ANA offices are places of aggregation Even today with emotion I think of the inclusion sign that stands at the entrance of the headquarters of the group ANA of Montefiorino Suppose and aim this light that leads you here among us Whether bourgeois or alpine you will find bread and wine It is clear therefore that from the Alpine headquarters to that of Civil Protection the passage is short and this also explains the great participation that the Alpines have as volunteers in peacetime The Alpine spirit is that of the National Alpine Association which has a motto To remember and celebrate our dead we help the living I also remember that the National Alpine Association carries out volunteering and civil protection activities throughout the country I 'm gonna finish With great sacrifice and self denial they were the most present of the State to the great disasters of the post war period To name a few from the Messina earthquake to the Friuli earthquake from the Irpinia earthquake to those of Emilia L'Aquila and Central Italy from the Flood of Florence to that of Alexandria and Valtellina without forgetting the Vajont disaster And how to forget about the setting up of the Bergamo field hospital at record times to deal with the Covid epidemic However the Alps are also present with gestures of peace such as the construction of the Sorriso kindergarten of Rossosch already seat of the Command of the Alpine Corps in the land of Russia and the construction in Brescia of the structure donated to a social cooperative of activities in favour of people with severe motor disabilities Inside there is a plaque on which it is written On the 40th anniversary of the battle of Nikolajewka in the memory of those without hatred but without vileness fell fighting for the honor of the flag and the salvation of the brothers the alpine have built this school of crafts with love and joy because to those who less have had by fate it opens a more serene future Here these are in a time of peace the crosses to the value deserved by the alpines all synthesis of memory and sacrifice as well as the institution of this Day which I believe deserve in full title In declaring the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione I would like to thank the alpine of today and tomorrow for what they do and still do I would also like to remind and thank all the Alpines of every generation who have gone forward and in particular two of them the Alpine artillery of the Val Camonica Aldo Corti group my grandfather if that January 26 had not been among those 13,000 survivors I would not be here today and the chief alpine of the brigade Cadore Senator Paolo Saviane who so much cared about this provision I think in a few minutes our colleague will also be able to smile happy from up there Thank you and live the alpine"
Madam President Madam Vice Minister before entering into the substance of the measure I would once again like to thank the rapporteurs Senator Pergreffi and Senator Cioffi who have worked closely on the complex issue of delegation to the Government in the field of public contracts Our contribution as a League to simplify the discipline governing public contracts aims to ensure clarity and support for our productive activities The draft law under discussion then lists the principles and guiding criteria to be followed by the Government I should like to make a few brief comments on this avoiding gold plating or the process whereby a European Union directive is extended for transposition into the national laws of a Member State This is a matter for which the League of Government has spent a great deal to ensure that the protection of work security the fight against illegal work legality and therefore transparency remains firm We have also included a redefinition of the qualification of contracting stations and their staff We have given impetus to the participation of micro and small enterprises in procurement I continue to list the contribution of the League for the simplification of the discipline applicable to public contracts services and supplies of less than the thresholds of European importance the simplification of the procedures for the realization of investments in green and digital technologies the provision of a compulsory regime for the revision of prices on the occurrence of particular conditions not predictable as well as for cases of renewal of the national collective agreement the provision of the obligation for contracting stations to include in the calls for tenders specific social clauses in order to ensure the occupational stability of the staff employed and the application of national and territorial collective agreements in the field in order to promote equal opportunities and therefore the occupational inclusion for persons with disabilities I stress these measures because we have contributed to the inclusion of very important and relevant clauses for small businesses I am referring to the review of prices which has already been mentioned and therefore to the possibility of adjusting the price paid to companies in the event of exceptional and unforeseen events and also to the possibility of dividing contracts into lots as well as the simplification of payment procedures and the reduction of administrative burdens on companies and the speeding up of the procedures for payment of the contract fee to undertakings by contracting stations Even more however we have focused on the development of neighbouring companies based on premium criteria for the aggregation of enterprises On a proposal from the League a rule has been adopted that makes explicit the principle of the prescription provided for in the Code of Public Contracts on the protection and promotion of Made in Italy thus strengthening the dissuasive scope of the norm and inserting a sanction that discourages offers containing a majority share of products originating in third countries Always in a shared and proactive way we have obtained the conclusion of insurance policies for internal personnel in charge of design and at the expense of the administrations It should not be remembered moreover that thanks to our proposals a new discipline has passed of the recourse to the draw and that thanks to the League it will have to be strongly limited and regulated because it would be a mechanism that degrades the qualification acquired to the enterprises Thanks to our contribution there is the rule that with regard to the provision of minimum environmental criteria they must be respected differentiated by types and amounts of contracts also preparing a transitional period following the issuing of ministerial decrees with adequate time for the start of their application Let us not forget our battle which provides for the possibility for contracting stations to resort to automation in the evaluation of bids where no improvements are necessary to the project and in this case the lowest price criterion can be used Moreover among the principles of delegation the redefinition of an ad hoc regulation for collective catering is also fixed given the high social value represented by this sector It is true before Mr Mallegni mentioned the unusuality of the third passage to the Senate It does not happen very often also because ultimately the discussion of the provision in the House took place in a climate of general sharing of the line of government and did not want to weigh down the text already approved by the Senate The new parts introduced by the House mainly concern the social sector collective labour agreements disadvantaged people some insights into design and professionals and also the promotion of the aggregation of micro and small enterprises and the specificity of contracts in the special sectors Mr President let me add as a militant of the League for over thirty years since I was a boy that the League has always represented the productive class the class that has always created wealth The League has always distinguished itself to be the trade union of companies the trade union of professionals the trade union of VAT matches This was thirty years ago and this is still today And this is the proof Mr President times are difficult for our economy The well being of the territories passes through the creation of work work work and work For a really good recovery it is necessary to simplify the purchase procedures in order finally to realize the necessary infrastructures for the revival of the building activity both essential aspects for the recovery following the pandemic and the war unfortunately ongoing Colleagues the League is in the government for the good of businesses and its professionals If we were not there we could not complete ideas and requests that could give answers certainties and planning for the future of our fellow citizens That 's why we fight and stand tall
Mr President ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to thank the Vice Minister the two rapporteurs and the whole Commission including the minority for the work that has been carried out which has actually been very fruitful and which has been as smooth as it should be for a job of this magnitude because this measure stems from a really fundamental and important necessity because by now European norms did not allow us to go further with the old code we were in some cases in breach and therefore we had to go to remedy by defining a new code for which this delegation is given to the Government in order to compensate and repair the distortions that had now occurred In addition to this the PNRR provided for the definition of a new code because as it was written black on white this code caused several implementation difficulties it was seen that it was a code that did not work There is a need for rationalization reordering and simplification of the rules How many times in recent times have we said that things have worked out well After the tragedy of the bridge in Genoa there was almost a miracle from the point of view of businesses and works and it was a success of Italy because the bureaucracy for once had left room for common sense At this point however we cannot allow this experience this success simply to remain a parenthesis we must take an example from what has been done good and carry it forward In the contents it was therefore necessary to give a delegation to the Government to define a code more adherent to the European norms that did not provide for the strict norms quite absurd abstruse purely Italian in order to allow a recovery of competitiveness also of our companies at European level without having to serve a birth penalty We need a reduction in time a certainty of time to do this work We need to streamline procedures speed up responses to the world of work focus and focus our energies in order to actually succeed in the contract rather than waste time preparing for the contract It was necessary to introduce innovations that were intelligent and actually aimed at improving the situation in the world of work We needed for example to provide penalties and premiums penalties to stimulate better and rewards that could actually encourage those who work well It was necessary to introduce rules that would favour investments and green technologies or digital innovation sustainable development all measures included in this standard that works properly 15.32 Follows CAMPARI In the Commission work has been done in this direction which has also improved the text for example secondary discipline has been redesigned because not all contracts and works are equal so depending on the types of contract the rules have been made even more slender fit and simple A facility has been provided for example for access to work by micro-enterprises this is going to solve a problem that has been pointed out several times with the aim of rewarding the virtuous enterprises of the territory those small businesses that we know that work those at zero kilometer This through the impedance of subdivision into fictitious lots or the amalgamation of fictitious lots Therefore it has been given value to neighbouring enterprises Work has been done on limiting the draw also in this case aimed at enhancing quality because here too we have to go on what we know and that works Minimum environmental criteria have been defined this is right we are at a time when we have a new awareness of how important it really is to respect the environment but this must be done gradually and with adequate time to enable companies to align themselves with these needs Made in Italy has been defended through the inclusion of a premium for those who use mostly Italian products absolute guarantee of quality Very important clauses have been included also in this case particularly relevant to small businesses I am referring to the price review therefore the possibility of adjusting the price paid to companies in the event of exceptional and unforeseeable events A comprehensive work has been done to make procurement actually more manageable and objectively operational and functional so that a work is carried out in an appropriate just and correct manner I think that good work has been done and that the Government now has the opportunity to translate the Commission 's indication into an effective act However we are available for any need I believe that professionalism within the Commission is a resource to be used and I therefore only have to wish for a good job so that the Government can organize the implementing decrees at its best and expeditiously I recommend that all too often the work is stranded in hidden meanders of the Ministry and a truly effective new measure can soon be launched
"Mr President in agreement with the groups in the Commission which I thank we have decided to withdraw it and turn it into an agenda It is a particularly sensitive issue concerning Italian companies suffering from debts not honoured by the public administration Hoping that this further contribution of ours to the Commission 's work will be appreciated we are prepared to turn Amendment 1,200 into an agenda"
"Ruspandini FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen what we are about to vote on is a reform that Brothers of Italy has had in its hands for a long time The need to revise the procurement rules had become improcrastinable and over the years the stratification of the discipline has generated interpretative chaos as well as being a brake on the infrastructural development and in essence an obstacle to the full realization of competition between small and medium sized enterprises We had therefore welcomed the initiative of this delegation law putting tangible hopes on it a delegation which moreover responds and is part of the logic of simplification as declined in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan It would therefore have been a good opportunity to test our ability to synthesize and to put the needs of all those involved in public procurement into place Brothers of Italy had interpreted it in this spirit in the Commission considering it essential to welcome the suggestions of the public world and I would like to thank for this the local authorities who through professional associations were able to make a great contribution to the hearing At the same time we wanted to give space in our re-elaborations to the equally fundamental experiential background of the private sector the DAC the academic world and the judiciary because the different sensitivities at the various levels of public evidence should have made an essential contribution precisely with a view to simplification Well the work done by the Brothers of Italy in the management of the amending activity to this bill went exactly in this direction we analysed the contributions of all drawing the necessary consequences and formulating the most appropriate reflections However the great expectations we had taken up were disappointed by an attitude of the majority and above all of the Government which basically betrayed the very meaning of the delegation leading to a missed opportunity In fact the first obvious criticality of this delegation which runs the obligation to emphasize is that it leaves very wide space to the activity of the delegated legislator and it is clear that the provision should have been formulated in order to direct more fully the Government that today so enjoys substantially a delegation in white With our amending work we have tried to set limits to the delegated legislative power both with regard to certain principles which for example we have tried to specify and with regard to the modification of certain institutions We have made the most complete identification of the needs for deburocratization already included in the bill trying to introduce benchmarks and for example explicitly inserting the reference to principles inspired by the emerging decrees of 2020 and 2021 which are producing good results in terms of simplification This was followed by the practical declination of the principle with a reference to the desirable involvement of the National Anti-Corruption Authority in the simplification process so that it could become an active part of the public evidence process and that fairness transparency and legality were guaranteed where a simultaneous easing of procedures appears necessary We have tried to put in place provisions that really go in the direction of facilitating and participating in invitations to tender for small and medium sized enterprises For example amendment 1,200 which was then turned into an agenda would have ensured that companies with credit certificates with public administrations could not be excluded in the event of tax irregularities that were not definitively detected These are common sense contributions which go in the direction everyone expected The latter evidence which is a battle of civilization that would prevent the state from acting as a tyrant when demanding credits and being indulgent instead with itself at the time of paying was rejected by this majority in fact It is not a matter of little account nor a technical quibble because when public administrations do not pay at the end the first companies that suffer are those that constitute the nerve of the Italian economy the small and medium sized enterprises that do not have sufficient financial availability and risk to have because of the failures of the contracting stations the tax investigations that then exclude them from the successive races like a furious dog that bites the tail in addition to the damage also the mockery In the field of public procurement where small and medium sized enterprises are affected it is there that not only and not so much the major economic concentrations are rampant but also the great organised crime With this broad delegation gentlemen we do not understand the direction that the Government wants to take for the future to define the rules on procurement which we can only deduce from the nature of the amendments we have tabled and which you have rejected It is not the direction that we like nor the one that serves the Italian enterprise and that the public administrations need in order to be facilitated the job In conclusion Brothers of Italy pressed for the revision of the discipline in an organic way directing the delegated legislator and tightening it to defined principles in order to give oxygen to the enterprises agile instruments to the client and guarantee of transparency and correctness for the realization of constitutional principles of good performance and impartiality of the public administration It does not seem to us ladies and gentlemen that this has happened and although we trust that our intentions can be debated in the House and can find a hotel in the final drafting of the measure today we will reluctantly vote against it I say this because the climate I have breathed and we have lived with our colleagues in the Commission has been truly harmonious and I would like to thank them starting with the rapporteurs We have really worked together and I thank them for the certificates of esteem that we have also received here which are punctually returned However I believe and I say this on behalf of the whole Group of the Brothers of Italy that a great opportunity is being missed"
Mr President I take the floor on this extremely sensitive issue With the bill signed by Senator Balboni the Brothers of Italy Group demonstrates once again that it is a constructive opposition which we call patriotic because of its quality and responsibility That is why we are proposing today to extend the rules of criminal law for road murder and serious and serious injuries to motor boat drivers As we like to recall Parliament if put to the test and in a position to work knows how to give answers and that is why I want to publicly thank Senator Balboni for his sensitivity and for the work he has done aimed at perfecting the regulatory framework which needed this approach In the sea in fact for a number of worrying reasons that I am not here to list there is no security and you risk your life too many times As the rapporteur also said newspapers and newspapers report the many tragedies that occur especially in summer periods in lakes and seas and in which all too often children lose their lives There are so many reasons including carelessness The Coast Guard has no means of providing security for its citizens That is why a law that introduces the crime of nautical murder becomes indispensable and that regulates it with the same discipline as for the road murder In our examination of the draft law boaters at the helm of motor boats with the effect for example of alcohol or drugs which cause the death of a person or cause serious injuries are considered as the driver of the car who commits the same crime It seems to everyone not only to me I believe clearly insane and unacceptable that the person responsible for a death driving a car risks 18 years in jail while instead if he is driving a boat he risks a sentence that can be only six months There was a vulnus in our system that we took responsibility for trying to fill For this reason I thank the Brothers of Italy Group and Senator Balboni it needed a piece that could protect the lives of thousands and thousands of citizens It is a strong signal precisely because it is a rule that can act as a deterrent for an invitation to caution to anyone who is riding a boat I agree with the rapporteur 's words that these very high speed motorboats are increasingly being used by people without licences and also let us say the ability to use the same vehicle It is a bit wide from the point of view of permissiveness in the use of these powerful boats especially during the summer The bill before us I would like to stress this presents another very important aspect that is that raised by the lawyering of the criminal chambers which follows a proposal of law of our leader Ciriani aimed at alleviating the inflamed courts and giving the possibility to resolve small private conflicts in a bonaria way especially those concerning road accidents It is another sign of civilization that shows how the bill really goes in the right direction
"Ruspandini FdI Mr President I have a different view and I believe that many things could have been done senator only if this government had pulled the plug first I say this because there are so many contradictions in the measure that with the little time available to me I will not be able to list them We are even talking however about the extension of another twelve months for the conclusion of the experimentation of the road traffic of single person vehicles despite the last report of Istat on road accidents is really heavy from 2020 even the wounded pass to 1,980 the dead to nine a pedestrian died due to the clash with a scooter I am only saying this in order to introduce into the Chamber arguments which have not been discussed The Government of the Best still extends the road trial by a year but I did n't understand what you want to experience Net of this the National Observatory on local public transport policies is transformed thanks to the Government of the best into the National Observatory for the support of programming and monitoring of sustainable local public mobility This is therefore a substantial change The local public transport sector whose criticalities are mentioned even in the Government 's own document is in great trouble with an economic and management deficit estimated at about two billion euros excluding the expensive energy and fuel in progress which instead of increasing the budget available in the national fund is reduced by five million euros per year These are the best of the best policies The minister Giovannini instead of overcoming the current serious moment for example establishing as we have proposed a fund for fuel has found nothing better to do than to identify a university professor of first class placed in expectation for the entire duration of the assignment which as happened on the occasion of the identification of the extraordinary commissioners appointed by the same Ministry will watch over the works of the 15 complex public works with a set of projects that are worth more than three billion euros representing interventions of essential road and railway connections with a result that is under the eyes of all works completely firm still unfinished 379 works throughout the national territory for a remnant of expenditure of about 1,2 billion euros In this atmosphere from the end of the empire I do not want to open the parenthesis on Alitalia an example of how a crisis should not be managed The path so far followed by the Government for the announced scaling a probable next sale of this asset to foreigners is before everyone 's eyes I would like to remind you of another subject with which you have rinsed your mouth that of the High Speed in the South In fact it is not true that it is planned all over the South from Salerno to Reggio Calabria it will not be possible to speak of high speed but if all goes well you will be able to assist in many regions of the South to a speed that will be in line with the traditional services I am reluctantly obliged to denounce the fact that an amendment of mine has not been taken into account amendment referring to the exemption proposed by the toll for commuters on the A24 and A25 motorways already proposed by the Gruppo Fratelli d'Italia to the Chamber which was precisely trying to meet the communities of our most marginalized territories of Lazio and Abruzzo All this has gone to cavalry even with the laughter of so many colleagues in the Commission For a series of actions that we have instead appreciated and that go in the direction of the implementation of the structures and infrastructures of our nation our attitude of constructive patriotic opposition leads us to declare the abstention vote on the measure"
Ruspandini FdI Mr President before speaking in an explanation of vote I am obliged to make a note to Deputy Minister Bellanova always so timely I admired her in the Commission because when she replied to Senator Malan she wanted to confine the matter to a mere administrative act The careful study of Senator Malan goes instead in a completely different direction we would not like to see in ten years some Italian boy point his finger on this dramatic management of the Italian concessions The management of Motorways for Italy cries revenge ma'am We are careful because I think you are taking a responsibility not to intervene putting your head in the sand really dramatic Let 's come to us The amendments approved to the text by the Chamber are those we know we have read them they certainly favour companies they streamline some procedures certainly minimal especially those concerning contracting stations they introduce a series of cases that interest us such as that of the principle of rotation they promote the realization of investments in green and digital technologies certainly yes they go in the direction of innovation and research which also serves us but for us Brothers of Italy are not enough I say this because for years now almost like a broken record we repeat that we want to speed up the procurement procedures we discuss narrate we aspire and we hope a change that goes in the direction of a reform that really the operators of the sector waited for from this measure but all this always seems not to touch the real nodal points of the system Italy that must be reformed deeply Probably however a new government will have to do so a government with a shred of courage Even today we have realised in this House that everything has been cleared in less than half an hour I would like to remind you that the bill should affect thousands of companies thousands of contracting stations Above all it has positive or negative effects which will reverberate on millions of our fellow citizens who are waiting for the conclusion or the start of public works that have always been blocked by the cumbersomeness of a legislation that has always been presented as a resolution of all evils even here I have heard enthusiastic tones which objectively find it difficult to share That is why what we are about to vote on is a reform that the Brothers of Italy Group has been in the lead for a long time at least in its ratio and has an interest in deepening we have done it you have said it and we have repeated it in the Commissions and in the debate in this House We have certainly interpreted this opportunity as an attempt virtuous and important to try to solve the problem and to be a case of resonance of the suggestions of the world of the audience I would like to thank the local authorities for this who have been able to make a great contribution through professional associations at the hearing we have said so and we repeat it At the same time we have tried to interact on another fundamental experiential background in the private sector I am referring to the DAC the academic world and the judiciary All this work also done by the Brothers of Italy Group in the management of the amending activity also in the Chamber of Deputies has once again been lost We cannot forget therefore the work of our colleagues starting with the Senator Ciriani group leader who insisted on facilitating participation in tenders for small and medium sized enterprises I would like to repeat that our amendment would ensure that companies with credit certificates with public administrations could not be excluded in case of tax irregularities that were not definitively established we fought for this and you also promised that the file would be reopened which did not happen This last battle which is of all evidence a battle of civilization that would finally prevent the state from acting as a tyrant in the moment of demanding credits being instead indulgent with itself at the time of paying was rejected by the majority In the field of public procurement we have discussed a great deal in the Commission If I have time I would also like to say a few words about anti-corruption authority because depending on the government this imaginative mechanism which responds to logics that are sometimes quite laughable is interpreted in a different way During the Count 1 Government it had to be slightly modified in the powers and so it was in the Count 2 Government Now there is a delegation in white written in this way in fact it is a delegation in white because in the current situation with the Government Dragons 1 they give themselves superpowers to this imaginative mechanism I do not discuss the authority but the mechanism In conclusion what was pressing for the Brothers of Italy Group was to review the discipline organically directing the delegated legislator drawing on defined principles in order to give oxygen to the companies and agile tools to the client guarantee this yes of transparency and correctness for the realization of the constitutional principles of good performance and impartiality of the public administration It does not seem to us I repeat that all this has happened that is why albeit reluctantly we will still vote no today
Mr President it would take a long time to be able to discuss these issues but I will try to condense in a few minutes some concepts that have emerged not only from the discussion of this measure in the Commission but also from the so called regulatory cluttering that Parliament 's classrooms see having at their examination measures relating to the management of the pandemic emergency We come with this measure to manage still the state of emergency and consequently the tools that are connected to it therefore the green pass and the vaccination regime We understand very well that government action had to be confronted with a serious situation And although the numbers are positive today in the sense that the curve seems to be actually decreasing and we are going towards a resolution of what are the pandemic problems but we must not lower our guard My speech focuses more on the appeal of government action to our employers towards our citizens who very often do not understand the goodness of the rules that we go to approve when they are obviously good I quote the example of an Italian citizen who just these days has found herself accessing a public office and has seen herself put at the door simply because the municipal administration to which he addressed did not even want to look at the documentation of vaccination exemption This is a problem that has recently been solved having arrived yesterday the green pass through a code that replaces the Green Pass Great but why did n't you get there sooner This is what our Group our Members of Parliament is trying to bring to the attention of the Government an attention which must be paid at times when amendments are proposed which are not biased or simply aimed at gaining electoral consensus as others may think On the contrary we try to listen to the citizens For example the woman mentioned who is Italian and therefore our employer could not withdraw the identity card because someone within the government team evidently did not want to pay adequate attention We are aware because we are convinced of the Government that this attention will come back to us and that therefore this type of problem can also be solved We also hope that some distortions such as those within the world of sport can be resolved I have tabled amendments with my group as have other groups on the capacity of stadiums and which is particularly important to me the possibility of having sports practice even for those under 12 years of age who have been vaccinated so that they have chosen to vaccinate but that during the fifteen days of the super green pass they have not been able to access sports activities I have been told that in the Commission this amendment has not been substantially transposed by everyone The reflection behind the amendment clearly responds to common sense if a boy has decided with the consent of his parents of course to vaccinate why not allow him to carry out sports activity If we go to say at all our meetings that sport does well that it helps health and accompanies us towards a recovery not only psychological but also physical why not also give these kids the opportunity to exercise legitimately and in the full capacity of their sports intended as personal social and sports promotion These are the attentions we ask the government These are the attentions that we must take forward regardless of whether or not we are in favour of the vaccine These are matters that I sincerely do n't care about I am interested in the fact that citizens can live peacefully surely and fully their status as citizens This is a reminder to the Government I do it myself and I believe that it can be done as a parliamentary House I really ask that this attention be taken by the Undersecretary to the relevant ministries and in particular to Minister Hope so that he can understand that certain proposals are not propaganda and political but simply proposals of common sense
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is a bit of a debate today about the reform of the judiciary and the functioning of the Supreme Council of the judiciary signed by former Minister Bonafede because during the Conte II Government this path has been blocked With this delegation we have or better we had the opportunity to put a stake and a firm point in the path of democratic reform of this country Let 's start with the reform of the judiciary Why do we need to reform the judiciary Clearly if something is wrong it must be reformed There is still someone who in opposition to certain reforms claims that things are going well and that we simply need to make some of them plain We say on the other hand that things are not going well at all There are obvious mistakes delays and distortions in the world of justice There are passages that go against the law and we as the homeland of law have a duty to eliminate errors delays and distortions We have approved the reform of the criminal process and the reform of the civil process because Europe asked us to align ourselves with the requests of the PNRR but also I have already said this and I repeat this because we were not and are not able to withstand the inefficiency of the justice machine as it stands today What is the morale of these reform steps that we have faced so far We have adopted reforms this is clear and I believe that we have come close to the goal but we have missed one last yard We have missed it in the criminal process we have missed it in the civil process and I believe we also miss it in this reform Logics of balance government and balance of powers not necessarily constitutional have led to reforms or reforms I do not question the commitment and the will of Mr Cartabia unfortunately he is not here today but there will be tomorrow which must be remembered he has brought to this House a series of measures which his predecessor and then President of the Count Council have failed to bring about and we must nevertheless acknowledge this However we cannot even keep quiet about the fact that we were and still are at a time when we could and I add more had to be done Here we move on to the other fundamental point of this measure which is the analysis of the MSC and the rules that make this body work I would like to point out that those who use the argument that those who wish to question the present rules of the MSM question the principle of independence of the judiciary are clearly aware that they are lying because nobody neither I nor my Group has ever questioned this kind of principle Too many times in an instrumental way we have seen that even if we raise this issue it is said that we are against the independence of the judiciary and therefore against the judiciary justice and law It is absolutely not true these are instrumental polemics that we refer to the sender We saw ourselves in the sedan because we simply wanted to discuss and deepen the problem but we do not question as I said before the autonomy in judging magistrates However I would like to remind you that magistrates are people like us and that as such they have talents and defects as everyone has lives and difficulties But who decides to be a magistrate let us remember that it is decided to be a magistrate has a bigger task that is to administer justice and decide the lives of people Justice is in fact administered in the name of the people and the law is the same for all these are phrases that we all know and are principles that we should all have consolidated in our pre-political baggage I remember however a professor of institutions of Roman law who in the first year of law at the first lessons told us that everyone knows that the law is not the same for everyone This is the point of tension that we must be able to deepen with these reforms and in order to ensure that justice is the same for all of us we must also affect a body such as the MSM which as I recall is a constitutionally important body and has the task of maintaining the level of the magistrates in a disciplined manner Discipline let us remember this word The strange events we have seen read and heard in the books and on the news have raised infinite doubts and reflections on the proper functioning of the MSC but we cannot do a Commission of Inquiry because when we wanted to raise this issue it was said that it could not be done So what do we do to reform the MSC Here too we take an important path we begin a legislative speech we approach the goal but also in this case we stop just a few steps I remind everyone that the MSC is a body of constitutional importance and is not ultra-constitutional Someone said that we cannot change certain rules because they are constitutional and as a jurist I say that he is completely right However I am going from a lawyer to a politician and I wonder why we have not gone to a more profound impact on this reform We have seen that if there is political will we can change everything in a short time Here is the key to everything if there is the will In conclusion Mr President I fear that for someone in here the will is not there perhaps out of laziness perhaps for convenience or perhaps for convenience What 's the moral I do not want to appear irreverent towards this Parliament but the student has applied himself but he could do more The people thank and how do they do it No longer going to vote no longer wanting to speak because as Senator Morra said nothing changes And we are all responsible for this disaffection Therefore when the instrument of direct democracy which was a flag of a considerable political part represented here is mocked even when we tried and got the people to vote on certain issues on which otherwise it could not be expressed I remember rightly that the 500,000 signatures were there I remember it for all therefore ridiculing the instrument referendary is ridiculing the people that people who with direct democracy wanted to carry on and recognize Instead by doing so even those who speak in this House denigrating the instrument of direct democracy as is the repealing referendum go against their own principles but this is a matter that the voters will decide I shall conclude Mr President Let us remember the priorities which are the unjust prisoners the rights recognized but denied in practice If we still have some dignity let 's change and let 's do it now"
PELLEGRINI Emanuele L SP PSd Az Mr President it is with a misplaced sense of inadequacy that I am speaking today because the facts that are happening not far from us obviously cannot but be the focus of our attention I would also like to make a few points in the few minutes I have to present our Group 's vote on sport in the Constitution to some aspects which in my opinion are useful for the reflection of all of us The value of sport why put it in the Constitution Why put the word sport into the constitution or rather the phrase sporting activity which has been correctly stated in this legal text as it is broad and absolutely exhaustive of the value of sport We do this because we all think that sport is a fundamental value of civil life and that as such it has the full dignity of being contained within the Constitutional Charter which is the foundation of our democracy and the legislative realization of the social relations that we must recognize every day in our daily lives We insert sports activity into the Constitution because it represents essentiality sport as an acclaimed example of human valorization Sports activity as indicated in the norm that we are going to approve today is the basis of educational and social development and the promotion of psychophysical well being I quote for brevity something that is very close to my heart and that I know is very dear to the Undersecretary Vezzali whom I thank for his presence and for having attended the process of this bill Sport is one of the key moments for people who have various types of disability or who have diseases that unfortunately can in many cases be degenerative I am thinking for example of Parkinson 's disease I personally had the opportunity to meet people who are suffering from this degenerative disease and who however thanks to sport have not only delayed its effects but have even achieved exceptional sporting results of absolute first order It is precisely by thinking of these people of examples we could make countless of them that we must find one of the fundamental reasons why sport must be recognised within the Constitution Sport as I said before is to be understood in the widest possible sense and I address myself to the Undersecretary Vezzali who knows how much I care about a broad conception I am thinking of Olympic sports of which you have given great proof Undersecretary but I am also thinking of amateur sports or sports practiced by people with disabilities the recent Paralympics are an example I think about sports for the elderly for everyone I add an aspect that the Undersecretary has transmitted to us but that all our sportsmen transmit to us sport is emotion it is a fundamental step because it represents the extrinsicity of the human being We 're not just sports results we 're not just numbers we 're emotions And now more than ever considering what is happening in Ukraine we must also remember this passage being a man does not simply mean being politicians lawyers or engineers it means being emotions I believe that sport has always witnessed this in history We can cite countless examples of people who have marked history I like to remember an example all Italian who did not like to speak much but acted with his sports actions and the titles achieved I am referring to the very Italian Gino Bartali whom we know well and who in Italian history has contributed in various ways to build that something that he did not like to say Let us remember that it has helped save hundreds of lives of Jews who risked being deported so to be killed but he did n't like to advertise it because he always said that good is done but it 's not said and certain medals hang on the soul and not on the jacket I believe that this is a fundamental example of what it means to be truly sporty As I said there have been many sportsmen in history and in order to relate to what is happening to the war events that unfortunately are close in the course of history we have witnessed too many times that sport has had to suffer the effects of the misunderstanding that we human beings often fail to overcome I am thinking for example of the various boycotts during the Cold War or during the various political crises I am thinking of the sporting sanctions that have been enacted over and over again against certain states including Russia for example for various behaviors let us think of the current totally unjustified aggression From the examples of history we have to learn that sometimes sport bringing emotion also brings logic into people 's heads I believe that the emotion of a Prime Minister who today told us what is going on in his country can make us understand what is going on maybe even in the attacking country We can never and I stress this a hundred times justify war this must be clear but we must have the ability to understand Perhaps also thanks to sport which precisely allows us to be together to live together and to understand each other we will be able to understand how we have reached this point and how we can get out of this crisis which I hope will end as soon as possible With this very emotional and I hope little rhetorical spirit I announce the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group to the bill
PELLEGRINI Emanuele L SP PSd Az Mr President I will try to be brief I had prepared a speech cloth but after listening to Senator Renzi I will probably have to make some detours For today 's vote we must start with a preliminary part In other words we must understand as senators of the Republic that the question of species concerning Senator Renzi in reality should not concern Senator Renzi must concern something much wider It is precisely the constitutional appeal that I appreciated in your speech We are here to protect this Constitution I can therefore appreciate the content and passages of your speech Above all it must be clear in the heart of each of us that this premise does not look at the specific case or the preconceptions or prejudices that probably some of us some of us within this Senate may have towards the individual person or the individual parliamentarians We must have it clear in our heads because it is the only way we can get a serious vote I believe however that this premise must be remembered today as we probably should have done in other votes that have seen the Senate express itself The reference to President Berlusconi as Senator Modena has done is obvious but I cannot fail to recall the example of Senator Salvini Even then in fact we have seen how the name and surname of a senator can change the vote of an Assembly It 's ugly to say but unfortunately it is and we 've seen it before That was the premise Let us now talk about Article 68 of the Constitution All colleagues have recalled the principles underlying Article 68 of the Constitution They are principles of guaranteeing the powers of the Chambers and of the judicial authority which seek to eliminate mutual interference This is stated by the Constitution and not by a Member of the Republic or a Parliamentary Group that is the rule that states it I would also like to remind you that this constitutional rule which is the foundation of the legal order protects not the individual Member and this is probably something we should remind someone who has exploited it but the Parliamentary Assembly and this is a much wider interest than that of the individual Member of Parliament We maintain the functionality of Parliament the integrity of its composition and decision making autonomy If we delete one of these three it makes no sense to sit in this House anymore We must support this rule because it is the basis for democratic freedom We represent democratic freedom here and the House represents it because we are an expression of a vote of a people the people voted for us they sent us here and we must represent it However I repeat that in order to represent it to exercise its legislative function worthily and freely we must always respect the Constitution but we must all do so we first but also all the powers of the State starting with the main ones If we really want to comply fully with the constitutional rule we must remember that its implementation must be full and respectful of all powers On this I listened to Senator Parrini say that we must not throw the issue of course synthesize into the usual debate between politics and the judiciary I am among those who continue to argue that the freedom and independence of the judiciary must be protected but also the freedom and independence of politics must be protected because if we do not guarantee them we do not guarantee the balance of the State Let us remember that our Constitution is based on precise balances and that it has been written after a bad period of our history from which we have learned many things We must therefore maintain those balances It is not enough to continue to seek easy consensus with anti-politics as someone still insists on doing We need true politics the one that has characterized our history and also the movement to which I belong because we have always looked at our base we have always listened to people This has always characterized us and must continue to characterize us We cannot allow the surrender or reinterpretation of constitutional rules to make politics more childish because it is easier to tell Politics is a very difficult art and precisely for this reason we must be particularly careful and careful when taking such decisions Senator Renzi could be told a lot Some of his expressions I honestly tell him I did not particularly appreciate them But democracy is of course beautiful for this very reason we cannot agree on everything and we must not agree on everything But let us always remember the words that have been said such as for example that the veil of the proxy is worth more than a sentence Let 's always remember this even when there may be some wild attacks because a warning of guarantee is enough to put a person on the cross I quote only for contemporaneity the fact that today has arrived the filing to the president of the Lombardy Fontana Region which was crucified for a warranty notice Let us always remember it when there will be other passages of Junta because obviously there will be passages of Junta Let us try to reason on the merits of things and constitutional rules because if we do not respect them politics goes away to get fried excuse the term and we agree with those who do anti-politics On the contrary here we must make the real policy and return to the beautiful episodes of politics such as those that were there just now when we unanimously approved a bill with absolutely meritorious content Let us try to find that content of true politics and avoid using the votes of Junta as has been done in the past Let us remember this for the future let it remain in the acts and let there be memory of this thing In recalling all this in order to ensure that all those who have spoken these words today remember them also tomorrow I announce the Lega Salvini Premier Group 's vote in favour of the rapporteur 's report with the premises that I have made it is not a vote in favour of Senator Renzi but it is a vote in favour of respecting the constitutional rules and democratic freedom of this country
Mr President I rise to explain the G101 agenda I believe that this swindle of the day comes from an act of political responsibility In the face of the decision of the French appeal court which concerns the refusal to extradite a whole series of people who have committed very serious crimes it is the political responsibility of this Parliament and the Government to take a position obviously within the powers entrusted to them With this agenda we ask the Government to commit itself to doing everything diplomatically useful and necessary so that the action of the Government also of the French Government because we know that however the proxy has a political derivation can lead to a decision to accept the request for extradition Extradition that is not only sacrosanct from the legal point of view but I believe weighing the words I say ethically duty free by all those institutions that must assist the relatives of the victims and all those who have suffered suffering because of the very serious acts of crime that we cannot forget just because it has been so many years This is a form of respect we owe to the victims and relatives of the victims To say that a defendant a convicted person because he is such is in difficult health conditions does not mean that he cannot suffer the right judgment and the right penalty Let 's remember that those who carry out the profession of lawyer are taught that every lawyer must assist his client in order to be defended in the best possible way but also in order to receive the right penalty On the one hand therefore we have a moment of political responsibility which takes shape in this agenda which aims to respect the legality decisions and convictions that these subjects have already suffered in our country in respect of the deaths suffering and blood shed in those terrible years This is also an act of international political maturity We cannot talk about the European Union in fact of European integration if we do not respect the principles contained in this Treaty of international cooperation also with regard to the surrender of the people who have committed these very serious crimes We cannot therefore think that this agenda will be allowed to go this way simply as a letter on paper This is a political act that must be weighed internationally Therefore we ask the Government to promote these actions of course from a diplomatic point of view because we know very well that French judicial action is an autonomous action By assuming the responsibility for what I say I repeat that we cannot think that within a sentence of a judicial body even if of a country absolutely civil as France can be the refusal to extradition can be justified simply because the terms the numbers of articles of the laws that are intended to apply are not indicated This is because we know very well that judges must judge according to law and that it is the task of judges to know the law and therefore to apply it That is what we are asking for on the agenda We simply call for compliance with international rules standards and relations but above all what is more important respect for people killed by people I cannot even define people because they are only criminals
PELLEGRINI Emanuele L SP PSd Az Mr President I believe that the vote in favour of the motions for our examination which concern the Government 's commitment to support and forcefully carry out the Italian headquarters for the Authority against money laundering and the financing of terrorism brings with it an important political fact It certainly gives weight to our country within a European balance that is not always as balanced as it should be As has already been mentioned our country does not have as much importance on the European offices of authority as it should have And we believe that this is an important step in bringing back the weight of our state to the European balance It has been said that one of the elements that supports Italy 's candidacy as the host country is the fact that we have the best legislation I do not know if we have the best legislation but we certainly have a culture that leads us to have a very important sensitivity And this will have to be one of the elements to which the Government will have to resort in structuring all those acts and commitments that at European level will have to lead to a result As has already been said we have already lived in the past when Italy has been sidelined with respect to the political importance it should have had I therefore believe that it will be a time as I say for revenge at European level As we said yesterday particularly during the debate on the bilateral treaty between Italy and France I believe that this will also be an important international moment In our motion at the first signature of Senator Candiani we also included another important element because it is our historical and relevant battle for our country also that of the patent court If it is true that for the Anti-money laundering Authority we have a strict and important legislation it is equally true that we must value the positive data we have within our country such as the fact that in Italy there are a number of patents and trademarks registered and marketed very high that certainly has no equal at European level That is why within our motion we wanted to include another element in order to enhance even more the Italian presence in the European balance However we do not just want to talk about negative things as I said before The anti-money laundering authority because we have the best regulation and we have the mafia phenomenon We also have extremely positive things which are cultural goods In fact always in our motion we asked the Government for a further commitment to bring to Italy the seat of the European Executive Agency for Education and Culture it is another important element We value let 's ask the government everything positive has our country We must stop throwing crosses and curses at each other let 's talk about positive things and think for the best These are important moments The Government the Undersecretary and the Minister will certainly be able to work in this direction and will always have the support of Parliament because we will bring added values this without considering the positive values represented by the induced of course bringing such important authorities on our territory means offering opportunities for work development and creating new and more important professionalism which can then also look to the European and international world We have always said to look outside our borders to learn where we can but let us never forget that in our DNA within our country and our people we have values that we have the right and the duty to spread in the world Let 's not forget that I would like to thank the Government for the commitment that it will certainly want to make and thank Parliament for the support that it will certainly want to give to the motions under consideration
Mr President I take advantage apparently out of the question to express my bitterness for losing the opportunity first in the budget law and now in the context of the conversion of the unified measure with the Government 's amendment for not being able to take care of those who cared recognizing at least a refreshment to the families of doctors who especially during the first part of the pandemic when they lacked everything from the pandemic plan to the personal protective devices and little was known of how to deal with the virus with a spirit of self denial have tried to limit sometimes at the expense of their own life the pandemic effects for their patients I am very sorry that the sub- amendment although it was shared by all the Groups including and I thank you for that opposition for unknown reasons has been downgraded to non-priority while in its time for example funds have been found for shelters that save wild animals a very meritorious issue but from my point of view of priority very much after that of the refreshment of those who saved human lives We have lost two battles but we cannot afford to lose the war even if we know that nothing will return to the affection of their families those who have lost their lives But in their memory we will not disregard anything indeed we will try to re-produce it in every place moving from words to deeds well before March 18 the first anniversary of the established National Day in memory of the victims of the coronary virus epidemic so as not to leave it meaningless because believe me sometimes the medical class is underestimated compared to what it actually does for the common good As we enter the evolutionary perspective of the measure under discussion it teaches us that we must be forward looking because unforeseen events especially in the health field are a variable to be taken into account even more than in other areas And we can no longer afford to chase the reality having to approach with method the prevention and recovery of delays in care to honour the truth already intolerable well before the pandemic in a framework of systemic vision of proactive prevention and of governance of individual and collective risks because otherwise we will face an announced hecatombe with incisive dispositions to make effective the predictive analysis and the surveillance systems indicated but still unimplemented In the same way we must act effectively with very persuasive mechanisms on the monitoring of resources controls and responsibility of the entire chain which up to now is not allowed to trace with the exception at least partial of the measures provided for in the decree support-b which makes us believe that our confidence to the Government although with some criticality of the way and even if it has gone a little long was and is well placed Do n't disappoint us with the refreshment of doctors we also make sense of the President 's words It is a decidedly challenging perspective in terms of order review to guarantee the effective implementation of mission 6 of the PNRR with an innovative government of health and new rules of engagement of the distributors including doctors of general medicine also regarding the proactive integration between hospital and territorial medicine going to reduce the incidence of the risks of pathologies not only infectious with an accredited network and contract of care continuity for levels of intensity and timeliness of care the Government on this despite the appreciable efforts should have a little more marked impact in evaluation and controls of appropriateness and security in a framework of full institutional responsibility The same should also apply to conscious adherence to vaccination prophylaxis because the increased confidence of citizens in the state should indirectly overcome many of the concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines as I will never stop pointing out we are among those who believe that we must convince not to force and one of the strongest arguments to convince those who hesitate and are opposed to the vaccine is that the State takes full responsibility for any adverse effects From our point of view a great step forward has been taken also with regard to the application impact of the measures provided for in the decree law in conversion with Article 20 of the decree- b since it has finally revealed the concept that an obligation cannot be imposed even in a surreptitious form without assuming the responsibility for the possible consequences from January 27 thanks to the thrust of the League all this is norm Acting in the prevention and promotion of the health of the person the family and the community through conscious adherence is therefore another battle that we must know how to fight and win together the way of our future by combining protection of health and fundamental freedoms according to ethics and responsibilities
Mr President I understand that there is war and that we must deal primarily with refugees and the devastating consequences on the economy but I would like to point out that there has already been war here an epidemic war with the effects that we all know And there are those who in this war fought for us and fell to give us the chance to return to normal I do n't want to think that they are selfish shopkeepers because it was proposed by the League to make sure that it is not recognized now without if and without but to the families of doctors who died in the first phase of the Covid a proper refreshment As far as we are concerned it is not important that we call it the Cantù amendment for me we can also call it the Belzebu amendment provided that we approve it In fact our bill no 1061 of February 2019 was inspired by the measures taken and adopted to overcome the shortage of doctors and the consequent reduction of waiting lists No one has made it a matter of primacy the important thing is to do and do well In the same way for the new rules of engagement of retailers including doctors of general medicine the so called DM 71 provides for a series of important measures already proposed in the bill n. 2153 for the reorganization of the emergency emergency pre-hospital and hospital of March last year Let the Ministry of Health take due account of the elaborations of the League for the strengthening of territorial care in turn integrated with the continuity of assistance that we have already proposed in our draft laws So for refreshment to the families of the deceased doctors provided it is approved now without further referrals and delays This brings us back to the House despite the contrary opinion in the Commission of Health Ministries and for equal opportunities and family at least as I have been told Show that it is not true in view of the promised confidence in the amendment fully replacing the measure under discussion We do n't need the cockard but we did n't think the government needed it either Call it whatever you want as long as you do without further postponement because just a year ago we agreed that the day of remembrance would be established and that the government would undertake to find the necessary funds to honor them dignifiedly in addition to providing measures for the remaining categories of health and social health workers directly involved and for those who have suffered major permanent impairments to the psychophysical integrity not subject to protection All this finalizing the necessary resources correctly and congruly since as we have had the opportunity to remark in every place such cannot be considered those allocated to date by the Government with the appreciable first step made in article 31 of Decree Law No. 17 of 2022 I would not like a superstructure to be created in order to recognise the measure which could absorb part of what is allocated which is already insufficient in its own right in order to maintain itself It 's what you do that defines what you are we prove that you do it and excuse me if I insist that we do it right
Mr President we are pleased that our proposals also contribute to increasing the awareness that PNRR funds cannot be unwisely spent especially in health care by finalising resources so that we never have to repeat ourselves again and never again find ourselves in the state of unpreparedness and vulnerability in which we were at the beginning of the pandemic Therefore it is strategically important to implement a national health prevention system not only from environmental and climate risks which must be taken into account as stated in Article 27 of the conversion measure but it is essential to bear in mind the need to make a system also for the strengthening and improvement of active and passive surveillance activities with One Health character recognition of determinants and risks and assessment of the impact of interventions prioritising the activities of preparation and enhancement of the capacities of the National Health Service for the identification prevention and response of respiratory diseases with high communicability and pathogenicity as well as prevention and contrast to the occurrence and spread of zoonoses This is why we have for some time insisted and little has been achieved on the preparation of the National Pandemic Plan for Proactive Prevention and Government of the Risks of communicable diseases with endemic and pandemic relevance and zoonotic character and for a vaccination prophylaxis really effective and safe without waste We are faced with a crucial moment in our political and social history which requires us to reaffirm with strength and determination in the current scenarios of war not only the ethics of responsibility but rather to anticipate rather than suffer according to the ethics of prevention as the fundamental principle of institutional action for individual and collective well being governing the evolution of the pandemic with all the tools and measures technically available This model could also be of reference at European level proposing rather than suffering the decisions of Europe affecting with the same authority demonstrated in the economic field also in order to orient health policies finalizing innovation research and resources both for effective and safe vaccines in time and prevention and for the fight against zoonoses whose social and occupational consequences if we continue to approach them deterministally and uncontrolledly risk being no less devastating than the ultraliberal and uncontrolled approaches of the technocrats of the ECB technocrats who have thought of normalizing Europe 's monetary policy reducing Member States sovereign debt purchases and raising interest rates generating a unicum where the remedy is worse than evil after four months of war amplifying an inflationary push already in place indeed predictable and prepared for at least a year whose responsibilities are plastically obvious This is the value of prevention in all sectors responsible for technology at the service of policy not unlike a possible pandemic resurgence on which we must now determine ourselves legislatively indicating the development of prevention and preparation measures to consolidate the return to normality All this calls to political responsibility the Government and the Executive of Brussels and to technical scientific responsibility the agencies and the government offices in charge sanctioning a pact of collaboration with all the structures and offices of public human animal and environmental health as indicated in our amendments for the realization of the essential levels of assistance prevention and protection from the risks of communicable diseases with endemic and pandemic and zoonotic relevance The principles must be strengthened including among the objectives the setting up of strict active and passive surveillance measures with One Health character and the provision that the system will contribute for the profiles of competence to the definition and implementation of the National Pandemic Plan for Proactive Prevention and Risk Governance entrusting to the Ministry of Health the implementation detail with a chronoprogram sure to complement what is not provided for in the decree of the Minister of 9 June We all have to prove that we 've learned much more from the last two years than I read somewhere and that it sounded like this You forced us to be strong I hate you Covid for you to be cursed Our strength our true strength is to act to act in prevention so that we do not have to curse
Mr President I am very proud to be able to help represent what may be the most significant innovations in the health of the future contained in Chapter V on health We have already had the opportunity to stress on many occasions that we need more stringent controls so that the national universalist health service can meet the needs of the coming decades ensuring health and protection responses to fragility with appropriateness quality and safety Many of the treatment settings have changed and there are many opportunities offered by predictive medicine artificial intelligence and personalized medicine with diagnosis and targeted and early treatments treatments that have proven the validity hoped to the point that we can say it has also done a good round of buoying on the side of oncology care with innovative drugs and advanced therapies New opportunities that will be made possible under conditions of equal accessibility thanks to the reduction of waste affecting the mechanisms of programming and regulation of supply according to principles of transparency traceability to health data ecosystem valorization of capacities and effective excellence It is true that the treatment will be increasingly expensive and therefore a system of evaluation monitoring and control of the uses and results of the services provided will be increasingly necessary which thanks to the implementation of the registry of the persons assisted finally at national level will make possible the implementation of the electronic health file after more than ten years of hesitations and uncertainties This is a truly historical innovation that the former Article 13 of the draft law which has now become Article 16 of the text proposed by the Commission proposes to systematize linking it to the essential importance of contractual obligations and of which the Government must be given the solemn recognition of having co-thought and transposed the proposals of the legislative I believe with sufficient possibility of success aware that it is a first step and that it will be further refined both on the side of public private and social health equality and on other possible uses of the health card including avoiding the repetitiveness of the recipes whoever is the authorized prescriber or any future green pass since the vaccination data must all be uploaded in the anagraph in real time The new rules in fact will allow to enhance the prevention and marginalization of prescriptive and dispensing inappropriateness This will enable us to address with sustainable spending issues that would otherwise be unbearable for the overall burden of emerging needs and the costs of research and innovation This in addition to generating savings will prevent innumerable waste of time from the assisted citizens After many hours of work we have arrived at a rewording of Article 13 as I said before referring to Article 16 of the measure under discussion which goes in this direction going to update and evolve the rules of accreditation first and then contractualization including supplementary and complementary health for what it actually serves and applies This work promoted by the League but supported by all political forces including opposition which I thank as proof that when the interests of future generations are at stake the opposition is also constructive we can really support the entire legislature alone because the pandemic has taught us how indispensable it is to have a health care that works
Mr President the agenda we are debating is a very important step forward in combining research and innovation in oncology with prevention and care and at the same time in filling the delays accumulated in the last two and a half years of pandemics in the interventions in election and screening with the related costs before all the important commitments required of the government at national oncology with what is essential to its realization that is the economic and financial security of the regions which must ensure appropriate and timely interventions in terms of responding to the needs of citizens at a time of extreme vulnerability of people and families The commitment on which we incite the Government is consequence of what had already been promoted by us in April and accepted in the context of the conversion of Decree Law No 24 with the unanimous approval of the agenda of the same topic last May still unimagined since so far the deficit that has been generated in the various Regions during the pandemic estimated at over five billion although not all spent with shared outcomes but certainly the emerging situation has not given the possibility to the Regions to do otherwise Therefore contrary to other occasions the justification for the request for sterilization of the related costs is absorbent and cannot be separated from the reclamation and therefore from the recognition of adequate resources Last but not least there is the impact of the higher energy costs of healthcare companies we are all experiencing it with the expensive bills which is generating inflation that has not been so violent since the late 1980s I hope that you will all agree and that you will all share and vote accordingly not only the majority but including opposition of which we have had great responsibility in sharing in the Commission the insights into the risks assessed in the possible technical prescription of return plans Last note not self celebrative I would like to draw the attention of all of you to our first draft law to reduce the VAT rate for goods and services for non-self sufficiency and fragility to 5 in order to promote the homelessness of patients supporting people and families in a logic of mutual help and self responsibility which feeds on the responsibility of the State in finding the resources necessary for the protection of LEAs and vulnerabilities not only oncology As well as I conclude Mr President we are rightly debating approving the reduction of excise duties on fuels over a certain level of costs Believe me the support of fragility is no less important
Mr President we are going to examine at third reading a measure which with regard to Article 15 has an inherent criticality already noted by one of the most important trade associations because it is not treated in the same way as the public and private distributors in the new system of evaluation monitoring and control of health and social health benefits Since this vulnus was not passed during the examination in the Chamber removing in the title the words private after structures and private after distributors as we repeatedly requested in the majority meetings and as well technically highlighted in the dossier studies in Chamber and Senate acts Since this is a mere material error we propose to remedy it irrationally with an interpretative agenda or with other measure deemed appropriate promoted by the Government as it is absolutely essential to foreshadow a scenario that takes into account the obvious disparity in the treatment of the different distributors in contrast to European regulations since rules of quality safety and appropriateness applicable to all structures according to principles of objective traceability responsibility and transparency I hope that you will welcome this latest call thereby avoiding future distortions of application and unnecessary recourses
Mr President I am sorry to have to remind you once again that prevention and control must be a precondition to avoid the cyclical repetition of problems which give a concentration of interdependence between health both human and animal and economics Not only that but everything must be dealt with in a supranational dimension as our bill no 1660 of two years ago had imagined We hoped that in the PNRR as well as in other circumstances it would serve as an inspiration and that at least in connection with the order in implementation of the motion adopted unanimously in June last year as the Government will surely remember there would be evidence of this No follow up can be found This is another missed opportunity to strengthen veterinary prevention and to relaunch public and private veterinary health Public and private health must be accompanied by the prediction of the corporate veterinarian as a promoter of the culture of the government of the risks and the reduction of the use of unnecessary drugs for example antibiotics which has recorded thanks to the category an important decrease in the inappropriateness estimated at over 30 percent even if the way to get rid of the antimicrobial resistance is still long We must imagine that healthy animal husbandry which is also based on the principles of animal welfare will have an impact on the quality of products intended for human consumption which inevitably affects our individual and collective health closing the circle with the growth of the gross domestic product We must overcome the logic of intervening only with omelets made investing adequately in human and instrumental resources to ensure structural conditions to deal with the emergence of animal diseases and above all to prevent them This is not the first time that we are in the presence of swine fever every time the bill is very salty Let us make sure that the measure in conversion is accompanied by the decision to finally give way to the legislative resolution that we have promoted and that like 12 a The Commission in the light of the examination of the amendment phase of the decree law under discussion has seen the convergence in the drafting of a single text aimed at reforming veterinary public health abandoning the ideologies that have certainly contributed so far to delaying the adoption of an organisational model of prevention evaluation and control capable of becoming a possible reference at European level It is a model specifically dedicated to the government of endemic and pandemic risks of zoonous origin capable of enhancing all producers not only Italians who are equipped with higher standards of prevention biosafety quality and traceability gives legitimacy to its recognition as common rules of guarantee in the implementation of the new European legislation on animal health for the welfare of the consumer changing the paradigm of the protection of Italian agro food with a system of evaluation and control able to demonstrate on the field the superiority of our products not only on the organoleptic level which is recognized us but also in terms of effective protection and promotion of human health and of the fight against communicable diseases and not given our way of addressing and solving related problems according to objective and measurable indicators avoiding any self referentiality in proving conformity to optimal parameters of prevention biosafety and health
"PIROVANO L SP PSd Az Mr President on Amendment 2,500 7 there is a logical question We have made a law that requires children to wear FFP2 masks both on public transport and at school in case of contacts and whatever else but FFP2 for children does not exist We are simply asking that a table be made as has been established with the approval of another amendment in the Commission with the producers of masks so that thanks to the cross-cutting work of the Commission they can be consulted as they have asked for over and over again I remember among other things that we always asked them to produce masks when we were in emergency This table would be useful to find out if FFP2 can be good for children and how they should be made But if we ask manufacturers and importers to have a low price in pharmacies for FFP2 we cannot find in the pharmacies of masks that are not FFP2 sold to mothers and dads and that cost more than 75 cents and up to a few euros We cannot understand why there is no willingness to solve this problem two years after the beginning of the pandemic This amendment seemed to us to be a common sense amendment because it is known that FFP2 for children does not exist but there are only FFP2 small ones So we maintain this amendment and we are happy that the Italian producers who helped us in the emergency were finally involved when the masks were not there It 's probably something that should have been done years ago and not now"
"PIROVANO L SP PSd Az Mr President how much is human life worth You can measure it in gold teeth to make bars you can measure it in hair to make mattresses you can measure it in ashes to make fertilizers These are the things we see with our own eyes when we go to the concentration camps Two years ago on 27 January 2020 I spoke in this House on the occasion of Memory Day to present the motion and at the same time the relevant bill A few days later on February 22 2020 the Covid arrived in Bergamo and I as mayor was absent from the Assembly for a long time to manage the emergency The bill remained frozen in the middle of the pandemic but on the way I realized that it had become even more important for what happened in these two years How much is a human life worth 1,500 lire for a Jewish child 3,000 lire for a woman 5,000 for a man that 's the amount that those in our country denounced the Jews to send them to the concentration camps At Auschwitz four huge gas chambers which were able to kill in the best days for them up to 6,000 people were the pride of Rudolf Hess An economy the German economy which prospered not only on forced labour in the camps but also on the very death of the Jews Jews who were betrayed by the government that was to protect them How much is a human life worth How many GDP points are we willing to lose to save lives According to some economists a man 's value is calculated on the basis of his country 's GDP In Italy a human life is worth 4.7 million dollars at Bermuda 15,5 in Burundi only 45,000 It seems that this tendency to quantify the value of life on the basis of the ability to produce income derives from slavery from the plantations of South Carolina in 1740 Disabled people were also an economic burden for the Nazis and they also found death in concentration camps For two years I have been wondering how much a human life is worth two years in which the phenomena of hate incitement have increased in a worrying way also towards the Jews For someone still today in the gas chambers they showered for someone the shoah is an invention for someone they died but not just like that and not so many for someone in the Bergamo military truck there were empty coffins It seems that in every historical epoch the logic of negationism is to reverse cause with effect because according to the negationists of the shoah the Allies needed the myth of the Holocaust to justify the occupation of Germany in 1945 I say this just to give an example but there would be many more Similarly limiting individual freedom to prevent the whole country from suffering like my people has been translated into a phrase of the kind with the Covid 's excuse this law has been made In fact denying a people what caused deep suffering is something inhuman that increases pain amplifies it and does not allow to heal wounds Denialism however is not only ignorance but above all fear because it is a classic defence mechanism psychological denial the fear that man can really be capable of such atrocities which is better to deny But man is really capable of it Is it afraid that if it were true if one day someone woke up and said he wanted to exterminate all those with brown hair a person with brown hair how could he fight against those who want to destroy it Simply remembering that courage is what changes the destiny of a people because evil men have always been there and will always be there because a madman can wake up one day and be followed by others who perhaps for political economic or personal interests give him rope without even realizing where he is going of what tragedy he is creating In every age we are always busy doing something else having more and more things or having more and more likes while memory is the only thing we have to make history plot an experience of thousands of years and it is impossible for each of us to keep it if it is not handed down by generations Young people will be our salvation perhaps even some of those who have been or who will travel to the concentration camps because it is enough that only one understands that it has really happened and can happen again However before giving them wings to fly as this Parliament should do by law making with our Government they must reach the depths of the abyss of the human soul and see clearly what can happen and what they might have to defend in the future from what they might have to defend their loved ones Today I learned by chance that this very day Virginia Gattegno a survivor of Auschwitz was missing was born in Rome in 1923 She was ninety eight years old her family was exterminated only her sister Lea survived This woman who left us on this very day lived in Venice where she had moved after the war and where she was a teacher having dedicated her whole life to teaching children who had an exceptional teacher I would like to read his poem because she was also a poet entitled Forget Auschwitz I wish my daughters had a happy life I would like a God to wait for me at the end of my life but above all I would like to forget Auschwitz but I can't I can't Instead we must not forget and we must ensure that when there is no longer even the last of the survivors someone carries on the memory not only in the books but with the testimonies and with the trips on the spot During this terrible pandemic I had the enormous fortune to personally meet Senator Segre with whom we collaborate in the Commission of which I have the honour of being Vice President I do n't like to look at people for the role they have for the officiality and for the whole construction that is done around a human being But as such Senator Segre is an example to me of how you can stay happy with a huge pain inside how you can stay smiling and make humor with a great intelligence This means that evil becomes a warning the evil that someone has suffered and the pain that someone has experienced and that you dedicate your life a part of your life to ensure that others do not feel what you have felt I would like to thank Mrs Saponara the whole 7th Commission and the undersecretary of Floridia Although the examination of this bill has been interrupted because of the Covid it is resumed quickly and I am proud to declare the vote in favour on behalf of my Group"
Mr President the measure before us should have been a genuine strategy for the economy of our nation especially to protect two people businesses and citizens This decree law should have looked yes to our generation but above all to the future ones which will find in their hands instead a bad legacy left by this Government You are very unbelievable and the demonstration lies above all in the issues you are dealing with which in your opinion are the priorities We are talking about the mandatory POS with penalties for those who do not adapt the lottery of receipts the obligation of electronic invoicing for those who even fall under the flat rate scheme Instead of working to solve the problems of citizens and businesses the last Council of Ministers decides well to postpone to a date which we do not know therefore not well defined the energy interventions Well I think you can't do worse than that Italian companies as we all know Brothers of Italy does not say are in great trouble 30 percent have reduced their production and within very few according to all the associations of category the damage will be incalculable Apart from all the measures you are taking even in a very forced way from our point of view practicality and a strategy continue to be lacking and we will never stop saying so In the measure that we are about to vote on the worst thing is that nothing is simplified the serious obstacle to innovation and also to investment continues which we should somehow attract Today that is those who come to invest in Italy find a mountain to climb and this acts as a disincentive Of course we of Brothers of Italy are not and will never be for a consumption of wild soil but we cannot remain hostage We must say that there has been great scientific progress in recent years including with regard to innovative materials and this could enable us to govern the process of energy transition in our territories and also in our cities We know perfectly well that there is no zero impact What is lacking in this measure is clear namely a reference to fuels which nowadays certainly represent one of the highest costs that both companies and citizens have to face So this is certainly a problem and the government has done little or even nothing to date Let us not forget that inflation rose to 6.7 percent in March The transport sector which is certainly a very important sector with regard to our country especially the rubber sector plays a primary role and is also a key sector with regard to the employment front so the objective would be to immediately reduce the excise duty of 40 as we have repeatedly proposed in all the various Commissions We must also intervene on VAT and not create disparities as many industry associations denounce An entire chain risks being brought to its knees because of this Government which has created a real competition between fuels It is clear that this situation has become unsustainable both for operators in the sector and especially for users The process of ecological transition of which so much is spoken and as I prefer to define it of ecological conversion because in fact they are all conversions is irreversible and crucial and must lead Italy towards the definitive abandonment of fossil sources and adopt more sustainable energy sources as I said before Mr President we know perfectly well that nothing has a zero impact but we must also get used to the idea that we can no longer procrastinate and that we also need sensible and courageous choices In this measure as I said before I see no simplification at all Unfortunately this decree law creates additional bureaucracy and above all confusion That same bureaucracy perhaps represents the worst limit for achieving the decarbonisation objectives so much desired These limits of course will never allow us continuing with this step to achieve what our country needs namely energy independence The real nightmare especially in recent years is the construction of RES plants renewable energy sources but the lack of streamlined procedures discourages investments in our country Let 's not forget that Germany has started running also launching an important plan to install 20 gigawatts per year for the next three years which will accelerate to increase to 40 gigawatts until 2035 Same thing France is doing What about Italy Nothing and this is definitely your demerit The aim is to avoid losing the great opportunities that are provided to us as we have always said in this House by the PNRR We must remind all of us that it will be our children and also grandchildren who will repay the debt Therefore it should also be implemented in a strategic way What is lacking today is not only strategy but also foresight You have not approved any solution regarding the promotion of self production and self consumption of energy for households and businesses The energy efficiency of buildings must be encouraged Let us not forget that a large part of the public administration offices is old and obsolete And I want to denounce in this House also the waste of heating in public facilities of which no one is talking and which represent a real slap to all those families that today are struggling to reach the end of the month and who do not know how to pay energy bills No mention of the Made in Italy and the incentives to re-launch the national production of the sector and also of the induced We have completely forgotten the territories that have been affected by the earthquake More could and had to be done for the implementation of centralized systems for production and distribution in the community The laws should include some measures but they have not done so for a long time and this is certainly a big problem When the left was a social left he said that there was an obvious problem of development model He does n't say anything anymore The need to supply gas especially during this period certainly exists but we cannot and must not make the same mistake that we have made with Russia and that Brothers of Italy has always remarked Self sufficiency is certainly important to us and it is clear that going to Qatar today rather than to Algeria serves Self sufficiency however involves a serious battle and nothing is said about this in the provision before our examination This decree law does not even mention the energy transition plan In conclusion Mr President we are also genuinely concerned about the superficiality with which such a sensitive matter is being dealt with This is a situation as I said before which is certainly unsustainable and cannot and must not be put on the subject of Italian energy shortages on individual citizens and on individual families because this would bring our businesses to their knees The Italians look at you they hear you Definitely without strategy this country will have nothing This is an empty decree- law which as I said before lacks strategy and foresight But the Italians are there they hear you and they will surely take them into account
Minister with this question the Brothers of Italy Group once again asks for clarity on the strategic vision of the Government if it exists with regard to the issue of energy It is clear to everyone that the Ukrainian Russian conflict and Europe 's strong dependence on Russian gas have imposed on the Presidents of the European Union a change of strategy on energy policy also in order to reduce dependence on Russia All this is made even more evident by the enormous increase in energy costs in Italy with serious social and employment repercussions both for families and for businesses The Government has launched a dialogue with several foreign states in order to conclude new agreements aimed at increasing the supply of gas from relatively safer countries also because it is news today there has been a 40 reduction in supply However the Italian Government does not seem to want to continue along the path of national energy independence According to recent data the need for natural gas in Italy is about 70 billion cubic meters and of these only 4.5 less than 6 is extracted in Italy that as we all know is also rich in methane deposits but are unused precisely because of limits and prohibitions deriving from the moratorium of the blockade to drilling and extractions and also as regards bureaucracy The recognition of natural gas as an energy source towards the ecological transition would certainly be a historic opportunity for our national deposits Yet just a few days ago Minister MEPs of the 5 Star Movement and the Democratic Party opposed the Commission 's proposal to include gas in the taxonomic list of renewable energy sources For this reason we are asking you Minister at the same time what your opinion is supported in European terms by Members representing certain parties of your majority on this subject and especially if the Government intends to increase national gas production by renewing authorisations
Minister in the light of your answers we continue to be perplexed because promises are not enough we have been waiting for you for too many months now but real and concrete legislative measures are needed to remove the ideological stop to the extractions We know that Italy is heavily dependent on the import of gas as you said before but thanks to its resources dependence could be reduced You see Minister families and businesses are paying a very high price so that many companies risk closure and failure thus creating further unemployment Instead we must note that this Government moves in perfect continuity I would say also in perfect harmony with the precedents because it is clearly slave to an ideological drift as we saw in the vote a few days ago even if you did not want to say something more it was obvious because the PD and the Movimento 5 Stars voted against This is definitely not good You have also claimed the name of the Government of the Best but day after day we realize that instead you are the Government of the Bestists Therefore it must be removed Minister the illogical stop to the new extractions that lead precisely to the upper Adriatic And then you did not say anything Minister about an absurd situation that of Croatia which takes advantage of our immobility and manages to do everything We are not satisfied with your answer because Minister the difference between us and the rest of the world is in our opinion the priority given to defending the interests of Italians So we will continue this battle because if the answers are given in this way we will clearly never be satisfied
"Mr President today the Senate Assembly is adopting a measure which precisely for its own part the competition policy should have been of central importance on the other hand we are once again debating a weak but above all questionable measure which is the result of a frayed majority The draft law under consideration should ensure greater competition and open up the sectors of distribution and energy efficiency and local public services to competitiveness precisely through economic actions The passage to the Senate however left only bitter in the mouth for the wasted opportunities also and especially for the discontent that all this has generated Unfortunately the government does wrong things and we no longer have news of the great reforms such as that of the tax indeed precisely on the fiscal delegation we continue to fear the umpteenth death on the Italians through the reform of the land register the usual asset that will be imposed by the Left which unfortunately seems to be the main shareholder of this majority The only thing this Government has managed to achieve is the expropriation of 30,000 Italian companies to give our bathing establishments to foreign multinationals If that 's what our premier Mario Draghi 's great authority was for then we have a big problem A government that calls itself the best and should be such had to allow Italy with the measure under discussion to heal delays in many ways unbreakable and to ensure the renewal of infrastructure transport and water supply These were the urgent things to do Would it not have been an opportunity for example to abolish the income of citizenship now become the panacea of all the evils of South Italy However I would like to return to the subject of bathing concessions which I mentioned earlier What the majority has achieved in this respect is a ridiculous and in some respects also shameful agreement There is still the issue of compensation even at the very risk that this will not be recognised by the European Commission This means leaving the current dealers totally unprotected which will be largely expropriated from their companies in favour of foreign multinationals We want to denounce all this also because the Government has already extensively and clearly demonstrated how you feel about the subject presenting an amendment that transposes the forcing of the Council of State against the legislative power of Parliament even telling the Italians and this is not true that without the auctions on the bathing concessions would have been lacking 19 billion of financing of the PNRR From such a government and from the implementing decrees that it is called to issue we expect nothing more than the definitive bang against tens of thousands of enterprises that represent let us not forget a fundamental piece of our tourism sector At one time the proletarian expropriation was in fashion for the benefit of the State now it is the State that expropriates private individuals for the benefit of other larger private individuals and for some even stronger aspects It 's an absolute shame This government helps those who do not work with the income of citizenship and instead beat those who invest and make pacts with the state It is precisely today 's news that in some areas of our country nine out of ten people have rejected a job offer and prefer to remain unemployed and keep the subsidy Today has been written a not nice page for all those who work Against this disaster Brothers of Italy will continue to fight in every seat We have stressed on several occasions the need to provide for the recognition of the actual commercial value of companies net of the investments made over the years Moreover there is a need to guarantee the right of pre-emption of the current dealers which is fundamental and indispensable to protect 30,000 families who let us not forget have devoted their entire lives to the conduct of these activities for decades A transitional period is also essential for the mapping of beaches The absurd thing is the contradiction inconceivable for Brothers of Italy that arises from the fact that the motorway and hydroelectric concessions and the private public services are not put into competition while at the same time it is urgent for the Government to hit 30,000 small Italian tourist companies in order to favor the foreign multinationals As I said before we need to ban motorway and hydroelectric concessions and not hit 30,000 families that also create a pipeline All this stems from the fact that the majority is split inside and fails to synthesize To conclude it is essential to return to the vote and we will continue to repeat it to the end since it is up to the Italians to decide who to be governed by The sooner that happens the better In the meantime we continue to say no to the sale of our beaches and Brothers of Italy will monitor the decrees of implementation for the good of the citizens Now we can only express our regret especially for the missed opportunity by this Government to exploit the opportunities offered by the measure under consideration Every day more you prove inadequate to govern Italy"
NASTERS FdI Mr President according to UN estimates every year plastic waste at sea is around 8 million tonnes Of course waste is only the tip of the iceberg The sea is literally invaded by plastics which then go to degrade and damage fish fauna The objective of this bill which we have talked a lot about in the Commissions for almost two years now is to contribute to the recovery of the ecosystem and to the promotion of the circular economy and clearly to the recovery of accidentally caught waste as has been said before for the cleaning of the sea Finally one of the important aspects is the awareness raising of the community with the dissemination of behavioural models aimed at preventing the phenomenon of waste abandonment Let us not forget that Italy is two thirds wet from the sea so who better than us should have at heart the emergency of marine waste Brothers of Italy like it very much when the projects are ambitious They fascinate us much less when these projects which in theory could be ambitious do not make the most of their potential This has certainly been a handicap of the bill to our examination so to define it today saves the sea is a discreet exercise of political communication Certainly however it does not represent reality and above all the truth We could call this as I have often said in the Commission a clean sea We precisely because we were aware of the importance of this measure had tabled several amendments To speed up the process some of the amendments had been withdrawn Brothers of Italy had tabled this amendment precisely to improve all the contradictions and there are within the bill By the way I would like to mention one important point given the presence of Mr Undersecretary as well In the budget law the application of plastic tax was postponed to 2023 It should be understood in the meantime what is the government 's orientation plastic yes or plastic no We must not always reason in a punitive logic through taxation because this certainly does not help I would also like to say to my colleagues that the legislation in place creates a great paradox namely that fishermen have to pay for the disposal of waste at sea We on the other hand had prepared an amendment in the Commission together with my colleague Mr Iannone to establish an incentive especially for fish farmers to facilitate the recovery of waste at sea We had proposed the figure of 40 euros for every quintal of waste money recovered but we were not heard This is because when serious solutions are proposed they are clearly rejected Instead of strengthening controls on those who discharge illegally at sea as always put costs on general taxation An alternative system had to be found to cover the costs of managing waste recovered at sea Why should cleanliness of the sea not fall within the strategic objective of the PNRR In any case it is said that it is necessary to raise awareness and that it is necessary to educate What is said in this bill is that we must inform users and also the population Let 's do it then but seriously If we really want to defend the issue of the environment we must also be a little brave and above all forward looking presidents in legislative measures We hoped that this would be an opportunity to solve the problems of waste for example those abandoned on the beaches or on the coasts which are then sucked into the sea but that was not the case There is systematic talk of finding synergy and also a union with the productive world for the relaunch of environmental issues We were deluded that it was the good time but it did n't For all these reasons our vote will be a vote of abstention because there has been a lack of foresight but above all a strategy to be able to actually help with this bill so many people who needed it
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen senators and representatives of the Government we are today called upon to approve the draft law on the development and competitiveness of organic farming agri-food and aquaculture The organic farming sector is constantly growing and Italy represents the third European country with over 2 million hectares cultivated by 80,000 farms It is a cultivation that grows year by year and represents 16 of the agricultural area used in our country Organic products are very popular and it is a growing market increased by consumption that increases every year In Italy the organic product market has a turnover of 3.6 billion annually and the decrease of imports from third countries allows us to give a greater value to Italian products whose demand on the other hand grows abroad Thanks to the great growth in both consumption and production organic farming is now able to generate new jobs and above all to expand youth entrepreneurship In fact 20 of young farmers are approaching organic farming which is considered as a concrete possibility to expand their economic activities particularly in hill and foothill areas where intensive agriculture is not very sustainable as is the case in flat land This allows to enhance the typicality of local and regional products as happened in Trentino Alto Adige where alongside the numerous agricultural crops organic districts have been promoted understood as local production systems integrated with agricultural vocation characterized by a significant presence of organic production In addition the methods of breeding and processing typical of the place have been protected The rule we are debating today can therefore add value to our agriculture by supporting our high quality products which represent the modern response to the local traditions that come from the roots of our culture and the identity of our territories and it is a law that our farmers have been asking us for years The forecast of the supply chain table Article 16 for organic products will help to promote and organise an efficient market for organic products and ensure the conclusion of so called supply chain contracts Organic farming is considered to be a privileged production technique for achieving all the environmental objectives envisaged This is in a very specific context in which the European Union with the green new deal the Farm to fork and with the protection of biodiversity has set a clear horizon and commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions protecting biodiversity and creating a less environmentally friendly food production system The European Union also plans to invest over EUR 40 million annually to promote the organic farming method and sees this type of crop as an instrument to enhance and protect the protection of biodiversity for a more sustainable agriculture The action plan envisages supporting consumption increasing organic production throughout Europe and introducing a new regulation to simplify procedures revisit controls and strengthen them for organic products coming from third countries The above is part of a more general framework of European agricultural and environmental policies aimed at reducing the use of plant protection products by 50 and the loss of soil nutrients by 50 improving their quality PRESIDENT The debate is closed Come on and finish Thank you Mr Pizzol L SP PSd Az The draft law on the subject today underlines that organic production is a comprehensive system for the management of the farm and the protection of food production a method based on the interaction between best environmental practices aimed at safeguarding natural resources and sustainable development These production methods are based on prepared and specific disciplinary methods applied in compliance with the provisions and regulations of the European Union and national rules on organic farming with the obligation to provide all information on the origin quality and traceability of organic products Thus there will be greater guarantees of third parties in the subjects authorized to control"
"Madam President ladies and gentlemen Government this measure has the task of combating the obvious demographic crisis of Italians and tidying up the various rules to support parenthood In my opinion it is very important to find solutions to the problems faced by working women in reconciling the desire for motherhood with work and the need to secure certain income in order to guarantee the new life what it needs If they do not have economic security Italian couples suppress the desire for parenthood because they fear that they cannot manage it or that they cannot manage the child when they do not have the grandparents to whom they can entrust him if he gets sick Let 's think of a self employed woman forced to close the store for example Currently there are no kindergartens although they are provided for by the PNRR they are not enough now One of the problems lies also in the ISEE parameters adopted for the payment of the single cheque which penalise too much those who create income and contribute to Italian GDP I think for example that a monthly single allowance of EUR 50 is too small for dependent children at ISEE equal to or greater than EUR 40,000 In other European countries which have our own problem of birth they give about 200 a month regardless of income This seems to me to be a fairer and more suitable measure for stimulating births It certainly does not encourage the sum of 50 euros per month three times lower than old family allowances given the high costs that couples would have to meet with a young child Far from speaking for those who are deprived of income or have insufficient income to be able to afford a substantial number of children as unfortunately happens in the many families of immigrants present in Italy and constantly arriving At a time like this when our pensioners do not know how to pay the bills and they also give up the indispensable such as non-refundable medicines or heating it seems to me too much to give measures to welfare everyone indistinguishably also because for each child you grant a cheque of at least 175 euros for the lower bands Plato in the fourth century before Christ admonished the Athenians by telling them that when a citizen accepts that whoever happens to them in the house can acquire the same rights as those who built it and were born there when the leaders tolerate all this in order to gain vows and consents in the name of freedom that devours and corrupts every rule so democracy dies for abuse of itself and before blood dies in ridicule It seems to me that in Italy there is now this way of acting It is right to be unselfish but without exaggerating I think that the universal single cheque as we have come to determine is too costly a measure to put on the shoulders of our future generations In fact at this rate forced to support the children of all I doubt there could be future generations able to pay the public debt I think that the Italian parliamentarians must first solve the problems of their fellow citizens because there will be no future generations if we condemn that of now to keep the children of all If at a time of generosity we have given too much now I think it is time to take a step back without prejudice to the aid to all the mothers and children who come from Ukraine In addition to removing the ISEE I believe that the dependent child allowance should be linked to all workers regardless of whether they are in compliance with the payment of contributions as it was before the single allowance We are the only country that has these rich measures of indiscriminate welfare and the one with the largest public debt In other European countries subsidies are given to non-EU foreigners only if they are political refugees or have obtained international protection Since reading some articles of the draft delegation I have had the feeling that I am faced with too ambitious and costly projects Where are the resources to do all these beautiful things while we are so insensitive to the many fellow citizens who do not know how to get to the end of the month I think it 's essential to be on the floor"
Madam President fellow Senators Government following a bill of popular initiative today we amend Article 119 of the Constitution adding a paragraph by which the Italian Republic recognises the peculiarity of the islands and promotes the measures necessary to remove the disadvantages resulting from insularity This is not a constitutional reform of a merely compensation nature In fact it will allow to look at the large and small islands as a heritage to be valued not only from the tourist point of view but also in its cultural linguistic and biodiversity peculiarities therefore in everything that constitutes an element of richness and diversity of our country The integration of this constitutional principle and the subsequent legislative instruments will allow us to have the means to bridge the gap or at least part of it that separates things and people of the major and minor islands of our country from the rest of the Italian citizens We think of Sicily and Sardinia and of the serious difficulties of connections with the mainland with increased costs of the transport of people goods and services that guarantee the territorial continuity There are also problems in the water supply housing conditions and waste disposal not to mention the weight of health emergencies or fires where the speed of intervention determines its effectiveness Even Venice where I live with the many islands and islets addresses many of the problems mentioned There are indeed so many difficulties in the daily lives of the inhabitants such as to penalise them Last but not least there is the time factor which with transports expands considerably in the fulfillment of the normal daily chores that are done on land in half time There are often other types of discomfort in island territories such as higher rates of ageing of the resident population as fewer economic opportunities encourage young people to move to the mainland This results in reduced employment rates and lower labour force skills as well as unemployment and depopulation which are also stimulated by infrastructure shortages and high transport costs The Italian Republic is finally called to recognize the peculiarity of the islands and their intrinsic disadvantage and promotes the necessary measures to remove the disadvantages associated with this condition thus demonstrating the need for the whole national community to recognize this condition and ensure any necessary action to guarantee the inhabitants of the islands equal opportunities and equal rights of citizenship This is a necessary step towards all those born and raised in the islands stressing that the changes made in the Senate aimed at preventing the term insularity from being considered in the Constitution exclusively as a source of disadvantage and linked to mere economic and financial difficulties For this reason the reference has been inserted to the recognition of the peculiarities of the islands expression with a broad and inclusive meaning of the promotion of specificity which also underlies a cultural historical and naturalistic valorization of these territories I believe that the inhabitants of our islands will be able in the future to appreciate the constitutional changes that we are about to adopt today
BRUZZONE L SP PSd Az Mr President the last time I dealt with this issue I said that I hoped that I would not have to do it anymore I let a lot of accidents happen but today I am forced to take up a really bad topic yet another dead person yet another person who is no longer there A few days ago shortly after midnight along the state road 693 of San Nicandro Garganico an agricultural entrepreneur from Lesina Gargano lost his life because on his way he found animals that were not supposed to be there It was the second time about a year before he had demolished the car but he got away with it in this park of Gargano where perhaps there is a lack of proper wildlife management being a park and things of this kind happen as in many other parts of Italy I would like to remind everyone else of that He 's gone He 's dead A couple of boars got hurt A few evenings ago our colleague Senator Briziarelli risked the same end it came out by miracle a boar got hurt We are on the side of Gino Turco a dead entrepreneur who is no longer there and on the side of Senator Briziarelli We 're not on the side of the boars A strange phenomenon is happening in this country Science tells us and asks us to intervene from the legislative point of view in an urgent and fast way to bring the situation back to normal scientific studies speak of a boar per square kilometre but on the Apennines we are at 14 15 boars per square kilometre I see someone 's face is tired probably not completely politically clean I say this starting from what happened this morning when in 13th In view of the problem of swine fever there has been a political agreement between the LEU the 5 Star Movement and the Democratic Party to establish that this problem must be dealt with by ecological and non-bloody methods I ask that there be a great deal of reflection on this As a Genoese citizen I would also ask that the problem of the presence of animals and wild boars in large urban centres be addressed We went to the vote on this issue and the political group I mentioned earlier rejected this proposal I say this as a Genoese in the days and hours in which herds of wild boar are wandering in the monumental cemetery of Staglieno
BRUZZONE L SP PSd Az Mr President I know that I am monotonous yet again speaking in this House on the problem of excessive wildlife particularly wild boars In the course of all the reports I have had in this House I have almost had the opportunity to say that children will soon be eating Unfortunately we got there and it's not a simple joke the other night in Castellaneta Marina in the province of Taranto a teenager while playing a ball game in the square as we use to do was attacked by a wild boar with one arm and one hand It could have been much worse if the boar had continued in the other parts of the body The boy was emergency surgery at the Bari Hospital and today we do not know if he will return to have a normal use of the arm and hand I am sorry to have to say these things and have to be angry for the umpteenth time there have been too many rejections even formal ones compared to proposals that have been made by us in this House to change the rule that would allow the number of boars in our country to be reduced to those who are willing to do this civil service today i.e. who is in possession of the license to be able to shoot them down However it can not be done because the stubbornness of someone who reigns in a part of this House has prevented it Even a few weeks ago an important exponent of the Movimento 5 Stars in this House claimed that hunting is barbaric Today I say that barbarism is the boar that you eat the child and shame is being on the side of the boar rather than on the side of the child I see however that we still want to go on like this It is therefore urgent to lay down and bury this extremist animalism to amend Law 157 of 1992 to allow us to do what I said before Here I say it and I would not want anyone to have the opportunity to misread my words this boar has anticipated the occupation of another What will happen in the near future unfortunately in our country because of the excessive presence of wolves an exaggerated number compared to what our country could contain It is not the rally of a hunter who has no interest as the category of hunters does not to go and shoot wolves
BRUZZONE L SP PSd Az Mr President I rise to interrupt a nasty and unpleasant silence On 7 and 8 May the Alpine assembly took place in Rimini Over the next few days a great deal of fuss was raised particularly in the left wing newspapers which were also urged by politics with complaints for harassment and it seemed that they had combined who knows what Then a few weeks later the prosecutor asks for the dismissal and the president of the National Alpine Association threatens legal actions I wanted to wait but today we are now a few weeks away from what happened and we have now realized that the one raised then by the left was not a mess but it was only left handed mud against the Alpine Corps against thousands of men who have made a huge contribution to the history of our country men who have voluntarily helped entire populations in difficult times earthquakes floods always present still present today in almost all the festivals of our countries and who will continue to do so with heart and altruism Well after a few weeks that no one from the left had the courage and the honor to apologize to the Alps for what they said and what they had written in those days today we denounce this shame gone unnoticed Not only do we want to be at the side of the Alps but we want to thank them for what they have done and for what they will do and at this particular moment we would like to precisely because there are the elections in this new Babylon that is being built on the left that they too understood that the Alps are a useful subject in our country that must be appreciated and encouraged for what they do and that they must also be helped for what they have done and for the difficulties they encounter We say dear friends that in this country we need some more alpine and some less left wing parasites Long live the alpine
"BRUZZONE L SP PSd Az Mr President we are about to vote on a measure which is as important as it is urgent which has been waiting for a few months now since 7 January when the first positive case was found in a carcass found slightly outside a regional natural park that of the Capanne di Marcarolo in the province of Alexandria where this virus was supposedly born and developed However despite the lack and also the lack of the government decree immediate interventions at the territorial level mostly focused on monitoring to understand what happened around that positive case I must thank here a few thousand volunteers nominally authorized one by one by the two regions involved For example as far as my region is concerned there are 1,618 volunteers mostly hunters who have joined together perhaps for the first time all the other outdoor users walkers bikers and all the others in a search for the infected carcasses A volunteering aimed at the general interest of society and also of the economy for the reasons that have been well said in practically all the interventions that have been carried out today African swine fever is dangerous for domestic pig farms and for turnover Piedmont has about 1.35 million heads of pigs Lombardy 6 million Emilia which is nearby as many The Regions particularly Piemonte and Liguria immediately became active but Lombardy Emilia and Tuscany have also done so together with the Ministries of Health and Agriculture and the problem has been addressed To date indeed to last evening the updated data is 490 carcasses found on the territory by these volunteers of which 74 positive to African swine fever all in the province of Genoa and Alexandria In the general misfortune there was a positive fact that the virus was found and developed within artificial boundaries namely two highways the A7 and the A26 enclosed in the North by the junction between the two highways Only in the Ovadese do we have six cases that have crossed the barrier of the highways which have a fence which occasionally gets knocked down because there have also been accidents with wild boars on those highways but it is difficult to pass two carriageways with two fences Two positive cases went through the Arquata Scrivia area This figure determines the urgency of containment operations especially from the points where the motorway barriers have been crossed The urgency stems from the fact that today we are going to vote on this measure with a hope that it will become as soon as possible the law of the State which will be published in the Official Journal In these weeks probably already on Friday the two Regions will produce the Plan provided by the decree for the contrast to the PSA with the possibility finally to derogate also from some outdoor activities Think that this area where you can't walk and you can't do anything includes about a million inhabitants How many dogs of affection and for other activities held by a million inhabitants who since January are forced to walk only on the asphalt and cannot go on the dirt road That is the further reason for the urgency What are the difficulties of a part of the red area that of the Riviera di Ponente for example that from Arenzano ends at the border with the municipality of Savona to Albissola Marina where nothing can be done except to go on the asphalt or to the limit on the beach or if you have the courage even at sea And we are faced with a period when tourism after having suffered the problems of the Covid should start again as well as the hinterland with the area of the two parks that are penalized President We shall vote firmly and vigorously in favour of this measure and I would like to thank my fellow rapporteurs Mr Bergesio and Mr Biti the Presidents of the Commissions 9a and 12a and the Government However I must make a few considerations because I am not used to acting or holding back within the limits of regularity That is what Mr Taricco said before the right presence of the boar in those areas as in many others should be one head square kilometre as ISPRA says There we are at 14 15 garments per square kilometre and this figure will increase shortly for the reproduction that is in progress Let me say one thing with my heart we have spoken on this subject several times and we are convinced that we were not mad when we said that we had to intervene to allow for a greater reduction of wild boars We do n't think we were crazy when we talked about damage to agriculture or the need to reduce the number of road accidents On the occasion all the dead that have been there should also be remembered I was n't crazy when even naively I wondered what would happen with all these animals if an epidemic broke out I called it that then I said these words in the Chamber a peacemaker will happen Nothing to do and five times now for the sixth time the Senate and the House could not bring to completion the necessary amendment of Law No 157 of 1992 which could have prevented the overpopulation of these animals No way Why Maybe we can't make it clear that the moment has come when we have to abandon the imaginative vision of the boar to protect that still today someone has The ecological methods have not worked so far and unfortunately do not work I would like to thank that part of the Democratic Party which has set aside this idea which has also appeared in the Commission 's work In the Commission we have even heard together with the proposal to eradicate PSA without cutting down a boar that of killing only the sick first we catch them we take their blood tests and then we decide whether or not they should be killed In the face of these things it is necessary to return with your feet on the ground We must understand ladies and gentlemen that the chicken breast is not born in a supermarket in a plastic box Says a Genoese it is not nice for anyone to see wild boars rumble and dig among the graves of the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno in Genoa it is not a good thing I truly say this with my heart for once to those who still hold things so anachronistic and distant from reality think of trying to descend from this five star cloud because it is necessary to stand on the ground Every once in a while everyone likes to be in the clouds but when you 're in front of serious things like this come back dear colleagues on earth 15:43 BRUZZONE followed I do not want to make any particular mention but sometimes the experience the reality the ability to deal with problems must fall on the needs of the territory and on what they have taught us To make you understand what agro silvo pastoral territory and rural activities mean you may have been told that the cow gives you milk but the cow does not give us milk and if you believed it you were wrong As a child they taught me that if you want milk you have to get up at 4:00 in the morning take the bucket and the car seat go there and get your shoes dirty and your hands dirty because the milk does n't come looking for you in the supermarket So if we 're gonna try to eradicate swine fever we 're gonna have to give up some of those philosophies Someone will have to continue as in recent weeks to get their shoes and hands dirty I thank all those who have done so and will do so on the territory I thank everyone for the measure that we are approving because its contents will continue to give us the opportunity to do so"
BRUZZONE L SP PSd Az Mr President I should like briefly to refer to the television broadcast Sapiens One Planet which aired on Rai 3 last Saturday 11 June On that occasion the conductor used the public television stage to highlight untrue arguments among other things without an contradictory one to discredit and offend a significant part of his listeners who regularly pay the television canon I am talking about a category or two that of farmers and that of hunters It has been said and here the great shame that in this state the people of hunters cut down on average every year 464 million animals equal to 773 animals per hunter If on Rai 3 you tell these lies in the first place you deserve not only to be denounced in this House but also to be cited at least civilly with a claim for damages in many Italian courts In our country is estimated the presence of 2 million wild boars and this gentleman says that 464 million animals are killed Farmers will answer perhaps So you can do some justice Even more serious and the complaint is that soon after on social media the host said that that of farmers and hunters is a minority of little importance in this country We are also for the freedom of minorities bearing in mind that hunters and farmers are not a minority in this country We 're for freedom and everyone does what they want If someone starting with the conductor of Sapiens One planet believes that he is vegan do so because we are for freedom We also help the conductor to make vegan They make free vegans but they do n't fuck with the others PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator Bruzzone I invite you to measure your words I 'll put it behind the board
"MAFFONI FdI Mr President Minister Bonetti ladies and gentlemen I am speaking here today first of all with some data on which we should all bitterly reflect 1.3 children per woman is the average today in Italy with a first child who is on average at the age of thirty one The demographic dynamic of 2021 continues to be negative and the natural balance of the population is always strongly negative as of December 31 2021 I report some Istat data the population resident in Italy amounted to almost 59 million units 250,000 less than the same date of 2020 This is certainly due to the dramatic excess of mortality caused by the Covid to the strong contraction of migratory movements but even more to the decrease of births which coming below the threshold of 400,000 has recorded a new historical minimum by the unity of Italy The non-enviable record which does not reach 400,000 units and the high number of deaths more than 700,000 continue to aggravate a negative natural dynamic that characterizes our country for several years However and here we must focus ladies and gentlemen this is not a European and Western theme we cannot hide behind these figures behind the screen of modern society which focuses on economic growth at the expense of demographic and social growth Of course it is noted that for decades our modern society has been less focused on the needs of the family But some European data lead us to think that the demographic crisis in Italy is more serious than in other countries If in our borders we have said that a woman does not reach the average of 1.3 children in countries like Germany and France we approach the two units for each woman France in particular is characterised by fertility rates which have always been much higher than in the rest of the European Union In 2009 this index was equal to two children per woman and despite a decrease the average number of children per mother remains high Why is this happening Why is this figure recorded in France while in Italy we are witnessing a continuous contraction of births Where does this problem come from if not from the shy policies that have been adopted in recent years on such a sensitive subject I want to be clear from the outset Senator colleagues and fellow Senators in declaring that Brothers of Italy has always and unequivocally fought for everything that can be of support to the growth of the birth rate in this country Brothers of Italy was available and always will be to sit at tables that can help the family which as Pope John XXIII said is the first essential cell of human society We have been available and will always be in implementing policies that inspired by other nations are able to offer free educational services or to promote cooperation between the private and the public in implementing policies to support the growth of the birth We have always been in favour of implementing policies of leave for paternity and motherhood that are more significant than those that are now recognised both in terms of numbers and in terms of economics Our battle Minister Bonetti is to offer unique checks for dependent children to all and not just to some From our point of view in fact the right to have a child must not see distinctions of social class or geographical areas However ladies and gentlemen despite the closeness to this issue and the sensitivity with which we want to address it we are obliged to announce our abstention on this measure This is a grievous abstention but not because we are opposed to some of the decisions taken by the draft law in question but because we believed and we still believe this that something more could be done and must be done Minister we were expecting more courage from you on this issue We expected more reliable times in which to study and build this measure we expected more resources and funds to counter a hemorrhage of births which in the future could have devastating consequences for our society and for our country The Brothers of Italy Group as already announced in the Chamber of Deputies has been voted against a series of changes that is right such as the promotion of part time as a choice for mothers There has been a vote against aid to enterprises for the recruitment of new mothers or young women or against the gratuitousness of childcare which we find essential for both the child and the family Minister we expected something more about the recalculation of the ISEE which is an essential instrument for the application of aid to young families We expected more courage on paternity leave or early retirement for working mothers with three children Finally we expected some intervention for international adoptions which are unfortunately today a road that can now be travelled by a few who want to assure small often unlucky a better future That is why Minister our vote today will be abstention We do not want to be complicit in any way in a measure that does not find the answers we were looking for just as we do not want to be complicit in a series of decisions that do not have the strength to implement the policies that our country needs today We certainly recognize Mr Bonetti especially you and many of your colleagues in the majority that we have tried to improve this measure We recognise with the usual intellectual honesty that distinguishes us that there have been some significant agendas in the Commission and we have been assured that we will re-evaluate the criteria for the ISEE parameters However Mr President in conclusion the Brothers of Italy Group on a sensitive issue such as this we had very different expectations We of the Brothers of Italy Group have always been at the side of the family and of all those who fight for it with strength and determination That is why Minister Bonetti I say to you and to all the Members of the Assembly that on this theme Brothers of Italy as well as it will not do discounts from the opposition desks will never escape from constructive tables where we can fight to carry out noble battles such as those aimed at the contrast of the birthday or at the side of the family The interest of the Italians and the Nation is for us primary and certainly will not be lacking today or in the future"
Mr President ladies and gentlemen senators government representatives there is no doubt that many categories of workers have paid a huge price for the pandemic aggravated by ineffective government choices and many times without a sound scientific basis This morning too we discussed it during the examination of the other measure The debate on this issue is more topical than ever since unlike other European countries and in full respect of the indications coming from scientific communities which no one questions we are currently subject to restrictions that no government imposes abroad It is also clear ladies and gentlemen that one of the categories that has suffered most in recent months has been workers and workers of the show for whom we are probably here to decide a measure that is so necessary but characterized by a guilty delay In addition to the lack of concrete aid from the State during the recent pandemic there is also a constant lack of protection for workers belonging to a sector that it should be said is a decisive part of our cultural heritage It is enough to look at the data to understand that one in five workers no longer works in the entertainment sector compared to a few months ago they are mainly workers and workers who dealt with the organization and set up an invisible but nevertheless fundamental phase of any entertainment and recreational activity To be honest the lack of protection is in fact well before the pandemic because for years the last successive governments have decided to abandon the workers and workers of this precious sector This is of course not good for those who lend their work nor for those who are willing to invest in this sector Until there are concrete safeguards unfortunately it is natural to think that there will be an even greater exodus from this area or further difficulties which could lead to a fall in wages and salaries with a final fall in the sensitive issues of safety at work The issue of safety at work is a fundamental one I also say this because I am Vice President of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into working conditions exploitation and safety in public and private workplaces The lack of discipline in this field favours only precarious working conditions and although the controls prior to Expo 2015 have generated a significant decrease in the so called white deaths in the sector now the data are becoming alarming again In addition ladies and gentlemen we are at the dawn of a season of very important events the first after the spread of the pandemic therefore we must be ready to secure the hundreds and thousands of workers in this sector In short that Italy lives also of culture is known so we of Brothers of Italy struggle to understand how the Governments driven by the 5 Star Movement first and the so called Government of the best then even though with a vast majority have neglected these problems until today Taking up the punctual words of our President Giorgia Meloni we are here to make a serious and constructive opposition I would also like to stress that we are not the party of the no as someone wants to paint us However on this very important issue too our demands especially our proposals and our amendments have remained as always unheard of It is therefore with regret for the umpteenth missed opportunity that we of Brothers of Italy will abstain on the measure under consideration
Mr President today the House is called upon to finally adopt at second reading draft law No 2415 of parliamentary initiative which aims to abolish the prohibition of simultaneous enrolment in several university courses and higher education This is an anachronistic ban contained in the single text of the laws on higher education referred to in the Royal Decree of 31 August 1933 n. 1592 which until now has deprived our students of opportunities instead recognized to students from other countries in particular European The draft law takes care of the needs to promote a specialized training of a cross-cutting character that is able to combine the deepening university with an increasing flexibility of skills and knowledge The measure comes to the House at the end of the examination by the 7th standing Commission The discussion of the bill held in conjunction with the Senate Act No. 1352 on the initiative of the National Economic and Labour Council was initiated on 8 February 2022 The Commission concluded its examination on 22 March with the conferral of the mandate to the rapporteur to report positively to the Assembly on draft law No 2415 previously taken as the basic text in the text approved by the Chamber with a contextual proposal to absorb the recalled initiative of CNEL With regard to the contents of the measure which consists of six articles it allows the simultaneous enrollment of two university courses Article 1 or two courses of study in the institutions of high artistic musical and choreutica AFAM or two courses of study at the universities and institutions AFAM Article 2 To this end the draft law provides for the repeal of the aforementioned prohibition of simultaneous enrolment in several higher education courses contained in the second paragraph of Article 142 of Royal Decree No 1592 of 1933 The draft law also provides for the right to study students who are enrolled at the same time as two courses of study and aims to encourage participation in the courses of study of working students Article 3 The implementation of the new provisions is entrusted to separate decrees of the Minister of University and Research Article 4 Finally the measure provides for the transmission to the Chambers of a report on the state of implementation of the law and an assessment of its impact Article 5 More in detail Article 1 provides that each student may enrol at the same time in two different degree courses master 's degree courses or master 's degree courses even at several universities schools or higher institutions with special arrangements provided that the lessons concern either degree classes or master 's degree classes or separate master 's courses a master 's degree or master 's degree course and a master 's degree course a PhD or specialization course with the exception of medical specialization courses a PhD or Master 's degree course and a medical specialization course Article 2 provides in relation to the faculty of simultaneous enrollment to two courses of academic diploma of first second level or master 's degree also in several institutions of high artistic musical and choreographic training without prejudice to the prohibition of simultaneous enrollment to the same course of study at two institutions of the AFAM to an academic diploma course and a master 's degree course or doctoral degree of research or specialization to a doctoral course of research or refinement or master 's degree and to a specialization course referred to in the same article 2 of Law No 508 of 1999 to university study courses and study courses at the institutions of the AFAM within the limit of two inscriptions According to Article 3 a student who is enrolled in two courses at the same time can benefit from the tools and services in support of the right to study for a single registration elected by the student himself in the presence of the conditions required by the legislation However the article is without prejudice to the total or partial exemption from the payment of the annual all inclusive contribution for both registrations even in this case in the presence of the required requirements In addition the article instructs the university and institutions of the AFAM to draw up an annual programme to promote and promote the participation of students working in the courses and training activities following the achievement of the title Article 4 regulates the modalities and criteria to allow double registration at the same time entrusting it with a decree of the Minister of University and Research In addition with separate ministerial decrees it is possible inter alia to facilitate students in their simultaneous enrolment in two university education courses taking into account university courses requiring compulsory attendance in order to facilitate the achievement of dual or joint final qualifications on the basis of conventions between two universities schools or higher institutions of special order or between two institutions of the AFAM or by universities and institutions of the AFAM These decrees shall be adopted within 60 days of the date of entry into force of the law after consulting the National University Council the National Council of University Students and depending on whether it is a university or AFAM institution the Conference of the Rectors of Italian Universities or the National Council for High Art and Musical Education Article 5 lays down rules on the monitoring and assessment of the impact of the law providing that within four months of the end of the third academic year following that in progress on the date of entry into force of the law the Minister of University and Research present to the Chambers a report on the state of implementation of the law and an assessment of the impact of the law Finally Article 6 contains the financial invariance clause
"PITTONI L SP PSd Az Mr President this measure introduces new measures for the implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan focusing in particular on the importance of digital transition and the use of new IT tools in different areas of society We all agree that it is important to respect the commitments made but it must also be clear that it is not enough to include new rules in a decree law in order to bring about a sustainable change for citizens and administrations It is not possible to reason only on target it is necessary that the regulatory interventions have fallen in reality that they are aimed at simplifying and improving the daily life of Italians also through a greater efficiency of the public administration The measure covers many areas An intervention that seemed fundamental to us to propose and support is that which immediately authorizes the recruitment of 500 students agents of the State Police to increase the services of prevention and control of the territory especially in the current context of serious social emergency It is essential to ensure the presence of law enforcement forces in order to prevent and combat criminal activities and possible terrorist initiatives as well as border control and control also connected to the development of the Jubilee of the Catholic Church in 2025 In the decree law we encourage digital payments to fight evasion and we have introduced mechanisms also to prevent possible fraud related to electronic payment instruments used in the lottery of receipts We have in fact inserted an explicit and punctual clarification on the legal constraint that imposes in order to participate regularly in the lottery the obligatory overlap between the tax code used to generate the lottery code and the tax code associated with the owner of the electronic payment instrument or of the funds held on the credit or bank or postal debt relationships used for the purchase The measure also provides for measures on infrastructure and cultural heritage as well as novelties for tourism justice the environment and there is a large chapter on the school but much remains to be done it will have to be done soon mainly to support the less large local authorities who are dealing with structural problems related mainly to the shortage of staff who risk seeing discoveries positions in the organic plant with infungable functions On this the administrations of the small municipalities did not find the answers they were looking for in the decree law and it is the task of this Government and this majority to provide it with urgency In the Commission we have improved the text with the extension of the possibility for public administrations to use all those who are concerned to meet the requirements for the implementation of the PNRR We have also approved our proposal for an extension to ensure that the municipalities concerned can include the process involved in the implementation of interventions on public goods for the benefit of the community The timing provided for in the basic text did not take into account the small municipalities up to 1,000 inhabitants let 's talk about 1,996 municipalities recipients of funding with a shortage of staff which were also overloaded for commitments and obligations related to the PNRR We express satisfaction with the acceptance of our fundamental request as Mr Pazzaglini said for the compensation to the municipalities affected by the 2016 earthquake of the Tari 's lack of revenue on the properties still unattainable We mean this when we think of concrete aid that can be benefited through the PNRR Let 's get to the school A success was undoubtedly the spirit of team patiently built in these months with authentic general evidence in the amending phase of the last decrees which allowed to receive unexpected results The compactness in carrying out at least the shared battles consolidated on this occasion allowed Parliament to re-appropriate at least part of the legislative function making the rapporteur of the Cangini measure say that more advanced school rules are being adopted than those laid down by the Government Thanks to the extraordinary compactness of the majority and the firmness of the Presidents of the Education and Constitutional Affairs Commissions we have obtained that the resources of the teaching card will not be touched Teacher training will be financed by an ad hoc fund until 2024 The government has committed itself to finding additional resources since the next budget law Of course denatality is a fact as is a fact however that Italy spends less on education than European partners we have pointed out it strongly obtaining that the savings due to the reduction in the number of students remain in the school sector Lights and shadows obviously remain on the ordinamental front where sharing is less easy there is openness even if it will be necessary to monitor the application criteria the training paths enabling to teach to which are interested in addition to those who teach in the state school second section of the provincial rankings for supplements in the peers where the shortage of qualified teachers makes themselves felt particularly and in the vocational training centers FP the teachers of so called caged role to whom the possibility of obtaining the qualification for teaching for a different class of competition and or for a different degree of education has so far been removed while possessing the title of suitable studies The achievement of the qualification is an essential condition to participate in the occupational mobility provided for by the national collective agreement of category CCNL And do not forget the doctors of research to which the experiential value of their journey must be recognized reaffirming at the same time the importance of attending and overcoming a specific training course dedicated to teaching in secondary school The question of the transitional phase for overcoming the historical precariousness cannot be considered closed On the contrary there is a contradiction between the European demand for greater attention in the selection of teachers and internal pressures with the imposition of a time frame out of reality to resolve the problem by exhuming the pre-selection in practice a competition to access another competition and cross tests certainly fast and economic but absolutely not able to evaluate attitude ability maturity and knowledge of the Italian language of teachers All this only to comply with the commitment to recruit new teachers by 2024 The recruitments if there is political will even with all the attention have never been a problem of times The doubt is that the use of mechanisms such as pre-selection and cross tests moreover already excluded from future competitions has in reality the objective not to facilitate but on the contrary to cut off the historical precariousness which even in the last decade has been charged to shore up the system The current cross competitions have in fact halved when not even reduced to a third the percentage of teachers who usually pass the test and certainly not because of lack of quality of competitors We will therefore fight for the extension of the transitional phase so as to remove any justification for the use of these instruments Going back to positive measures we have obtained access to specialization courses on support even without qualification for those who have three years of specific experience I remember that over a third of the teaching staff are not specialized There is the restoration in competitions of the merit rankings of the fit to cover the posts that subsequently become vacant and available We particularly cared together with the return of the interim allocation interprovincial important especially for mothers with small children a question that on other tables seems finally to start to solution There is the exemption of the school manager 's collaborators for emergency schools Finally there is the extraordinary competition for Catholic religious insecure persons with at least thirty six months of service in state schools The rankings following the extraordinary procedure will be used each year until their total exhaustion The time limits for submitting applications the procedures for carrying out the didactic methodological oral test and the evaluation of the same and the qualifications for the preparation of the rankings will be laid down by the Ministry of Education For these reasons I announce the favorable vote of the League Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione"
DORIA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen in the wake of the constructive criticism drawn up today by our Parent Company and yesterday by my previous friend Bagnai and colleagues I am speaking in an explanation of vote on the conversion into law of the reopening decree- law in order to finally celebrate the end of the state of emergency It is not a controversy for me but to be honest in my dual capacity as a doctor and a Member of Parliament I would like to stress that today we are converting a decree law into law that I could call decoction because it bears within it a series of rules that have already expired To allow you to follow the logical link of my reasoning I will quote the most salient articles and you will allow me some comments By carefully reading the measure one might wonder whether today the state of emergency has really ceased and whether it has ceased for a real favorable evolution of the pandemic framework or only for enchantment of the legislator distracted by other more pressing emergencies But our Minister of Health and the President in Office of the Council are respectable men and would never produce a document attesting to the cessation of the state of emergency if that were not the case Yet reading the text carefully one might wonder if changing the order of factors the product does not change recalling the famous phrase of Tancredi in Gattopardo where if we want everything to remain as it is everything needs to change Based on the assumption that the state of emergency has ceased to date from 31 March 2022 Article 1 which I read directly provides that civil protection orders may be adopted at the reasoned request of the competent administrations with limited effectiveness until 31 December 2022 in order to adapt to the evolution of the state of the pandemic by Covid 19 the measures of contrast in the organizational operational and logistic field already enacted during the state of emergency With the end of the state of emergency which cannot be extended beyond two years the figure of the Commissioner also lapses In this regard I would like to thank General Son for the professionalism and dedication with which he has been able to carry out the assigned task from excellent soldier and expert of logistics He has given us a new course in the fight against the pandemic making us forget the tragic primrose and infamous wheelchairs But let us return to the text at some very smoky points Article 2 provides in paragraphs 1 to 8 for the establishment of a unit for the completion of the vaccination campaign and for the adoption of others which are not better specified measures to combat the pandemic The structure operates until 31 December 2022 replacing the Extraordinary Commissioner since the Director of the new unit is assigned the same old powers as the Extraordinary Commissioner It is also provided that from 1 January 2023 the Ministry of Health will be responsible for the active and passive functions and relationships which in turn will enjoy the same powers as the Special Commissioner providing for an ever better definition of the organizational structure of the Dicastery and the authorization to hire from 1 October 2022 a quota of dedicated personnel The Minister of Health as well as the President in Office of the Council are respectable men and we would therefore do them an unforgivable wrong if we advanced the doubt that this rule was intended to mitigate the prohibition in fact of an extension of the state of emergency not foreseen Even in paragraph 8 bis of Article 2 it has perhaps been exaggerated to foresee the administration at the pharmacies of both SARS CoV 2 vaccines and flu vaccines in adult subjects with burdens on the caregivers by pharmacists appropriately trained and trained for the purpose by the Higher Institute of Health As a doctor I must stress that vaccination is a medical act and as such should be carried out under the direct control of the health care provider in order to manage possible complications at the time of injection such as anafilactic shock or wandering seizures Without wishing to diminish the role of the pharmacist it might have been worth extending the audience of qualified subjects involving nurses in the first place but also dental practitioners or why not veterinary doctors since especially the latter already have considerable skills and skills in treating all mammals except our species Article 5 is of great interest to everyone and regulates the obligation to wear FFP2 masks on means of transport This obligation is extended to 15 June 2022 for the most common means of transport as the law says and is confirmed until 30 April 2022 then already expired and decoction for access to vehicles such as cable cars cable cars and chairlifts It is spontaneous to wonder what is meant by more common referring to public transport and how different types of transport differ from the subject of the norm In fact we do not know that the cable cars operate only during the winter period nor that the virus has the ability to discriminate between those who travel by bus or on a cable car But the Minister of Health and the President in Office of the Council who are respectable men would never have enacted a decree law without scientific bases but we find it difficult to find it in the Order of the Ministry of Health of 28 April 2022 So some questions arise spontaneously why is there no obligation for the mask throughout Europe Are Italians more realistic than the king Is scientific literature agreed on the real filtering effectiveness of the mask compared to the infinitesimal size of SARS CoV 2 virus Paragraph 1 of Article 5 confirms the obligation to wear the type FFP2 devices until 30 April 2022 therefore already expired also for the shows and sporting events that take place outdoors and until 15 June 2022 for the same events that take place indoors For a long time it has been documented how the possibility of infection in the open air is minimal therefore it is difficult to find a rational one at their use Equally irrational and not supported by scientific data is the obligation to use masks during the lesson time part of students and teachers of the first and second grade primary and secondary schools as indicated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 9 Applause goes to Matteo Salvini who on Monday launched an appeal to change this unnecessarily oppressive rule which infests on children and young people already strongly tested by the pandemic events which have compromised any form of socialization with the well known psychosocial repercussions that this has brought and still entails Article 6 paragraph 1 extends until 31 December 2022 the current measures regulating the temporary exits of guests from residential health and social health facilities allowed only to guests with the Covid 19 green certifications which can be obtained following vaccination certified healing or after a negative rapid antigen test carried out in the last 48 hours or a molecular test in the last seventy two Nothing has changed since the time when the state of emergency existed but the Minister of Health and the President of the Council are respectable men and would never have enacted a decree law to cease the state of emergency if this had not actually been concluded Despite this some doubt in the light of these articles still remains Article 7 a specifies the duration of validity of the green certificate following a vaccination cycle Here there is a real diatribe on the scientificity of the vaccination obligation as set out in Italy where there are thousands of cases attested to symptomatic reinfection even serious in subjects who had completed the vaccination cycle even with the third dose not to mention the so called novax which by choice and conviction did not want to undergo vaccination going to suffer the suspension from the work and its remuneration except to see today recognized their reasons by the regional administrative courts and obtaining the payment of emoluments and attorneys with obvious damage to the treasury as well as in contempt of the right to work sanctioned by the Constitution I have only mentioned a few of the articles in the re-opening decree law that we are about to convert into law to stimulate a certain critical spirit which has been appearing in this House for some time now Then in the eternal conflict between reason and feeling interest and uprightness it can be seen that sometimes although we can go to heaven in a carriage we choose to go to hell on foot I would therefore like to conclude the speech by stressing that despite the concerns raised the work of the Minister of Health and the President of the Council who are respectable people in the full awareness of being going through the dark times of a tragic global crisis the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione intends to give this Government once again a thoughtful confidence declaring the vote in favour of this measure
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen today is a very important day because the measure concerning the inclusion of the principle of insularity in the Constitution is back in the Chamber and it is therefore the Sicilian and Sardinian Members who have always lived the insularity and also suffered If on the one hand the insularity and its remoteness from the continent as we use to say was in my opinion an opportunity for Sardinia to be a laboratory of genetics that selected genomes that gave our land the epithet of the centenarians recognized all over the world on the other hand today this condition of insularity is lived as a disadvantage and a ball at the foot of the economic development of Sardinian society It is also enough to read today 's newspapers which highlight the problem of maritime and air transport caused by the uncertainty of carriers engaged in a territorial continuity sui generis which has nothing to do with that of other European regions as well as the high price increases for both passengers and goods this is a decisive factor in limiting and preventing the long awaited growth There are clear responsibilities that must be sought in a stepmother attitude by the Italian State and the European institutions which continue to trample on the rights of a people as well as its special autonomy as a Region unlike many others even Italian Today does not want to be the moment of recriminations but the moment of awareness and the fight for the recognition of inalienable rights For completeness I mention only two still unresolved points that must represent our battle horses for the next political struggles and that will allow our islands to compete in equal arms with the other regions of Europe the inclusion of Sardinia and Sicily in the list of poor European regions and the recognition for Sardinia of the linguistic minority that is the Sardinian language spoken by more than one million Italians and with it of the parliamentary representation by default as happens for other realities such as the Val d'Aosta or the Trentino Alto Adige not succubi of the only barrier of 3 percent When the European Economic Community was set up in writing the Treaties those who preceded us thought well of protecting the regions which for geographical reasons of insularity could be disadvantaged compared to the continental ones and for which there were derogations both for State aid and for the rules of maritime and air transport allowing for a certain deregulation Too bad that while for many European countries we have been able to list the regions that we might call uncomfortable the Azores for Portugal Corsica and also the overseas territories for France the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands for Spain the Faroe Islands for Denmark Italy has not indicated any region Therefore we in Sardinia for example live that state of perennial disadvantage compared to our neighbour Corsica which translates into a less productive capacity and social well being and which pushes our fellow countrymen to seek it by emigrate The political rise of President Draghi has illuded us that his international prestige could be put at the service of our cause but perhaps representing with our 1,600,000 inhabitants the size of two large Roman districts we do not represent a sufficient critical mass and worthy of respect Today however it wants to be a good day to allow us to add a new piece to improve our Constitution and try to make it fairer and more supportive We are convinced that we will support this measure Thank you and Fortza Paris"
Madam President this gradual return to normality is important even if I still speak with the mask today but I understand that we are almost there too
RIPAMONTI rapporteur I 'm confident Mr Collina gave a fair description of the course of this measure which is coming to this House today I would instead like to start with sincere and heartfelt thanks first of all to the Government represented I say this for the part that has not participated actively in our work then the Minister D'Incà especially by Deputy Minister Pichetto Fratin and by the Undersecretary Bini who in recent months alongside each other have given a great boost to an important job perhaps underestimated that Parliament and this majority have carried out for a measure that someone has defined as the most important of the whole legislature It should not be forgotten how important this bill is for the continuation of our path within the PNRR Allow me to thank my group leader Massimiliano Romeo for the confidence he has shown me in allowing me to follow this measure within my Commission and President Girotto whom I particularly thank for the balance he has always shown over the past few months trying to find a path that combined two political forces a little distant such as the League and the PD in the representation of the rapporteurs but also all the majority forces He has always done so with great balance so I thank him I would also like to thank my Parent Company in the Commission Roberto Marti who has been enormously useful to me and all my colleagues from the 10th The Commission together with colleagues in the House who have spoken from time to time has shown a great sense of responsibility depending on the article we are talking about and has never shirked away from the Commission 's work I would like to thank Dr Di Caesar very much I want to do so too without whom it was difficult honestly to come out of this mechanism perhaps a little new at least for me it certainly is of a measure made with two thousand hands between the House and the Senate Thank you so much The last thanks and then move on to some consideration I address it to my co-rapporteur because in the end we have shown that sometimes you can also be distant from the point of view of the balance of politics but you can be much closer when the substance prevails So thanks to Senator Collina for the great work and thanks to all the Leaders here I see Senator De Petris Senator Malpezzi Senator Castellone Senator Faraone In the end they brought us back when it was time to do so to concreteness This bill is fundamental for the PNRR as Senator Collina has very well reminded us and in the report that we are going to deliver to Parliament it is very well described how important it is and how much work has been done a huge amount of work carried out together with the House and I assure you that it has not been very simple because political positions are different and sometimes within the political group itself there are different opinions I speak for my own not for others in order to avoid controversy I believe there has been a non-coherent narrative or rather in recent times a message has emerged not so consistent with the true work of the whole Parliament the whole Senate and the House but above all not consistent with the efforts of the two rapporteurs and representatives of the Government who have very much applied themselves to this measure perhaps leading it in the end to a single subject that of the last days relating to bathing concessions On the other hand within this bill there is a world that has been set up and that has been put in a position to obtain the necessary and binding funds provided for in the contracts we have signed with Europe And alive God for once we sign the contracts and respect them We have solved of the important points like the hydropower the tied part to the portualità the tied part to the derivation of the gas and the tied part to the in house changing also a little that perhaps was a wrong approach regarding a great topic like that of the house to the great ability of the territories to make system between them Therefore we tried to protect this aspect while remaining within the perimeter of the competition that was called up I do not extend my speech too long because the general debate will involve many speeches and I do not want to take away from colleagues who will intervene in the strength and desire to claim within this bill their belongings Therefore I just congratulate everyone and say that in my opinion this bill was an important demonstration of how we can work and work well reserving for reply because otherwise it would not be me some pebbles to remove
Mr President I have listened carefully to all the speeches that have been made in these more than three hours of general discussion I believe that there have been pertinent and exact interventions on the spirit of this bill All my colleagues have highlighted the work that has been done by the Commission the Government and the rapporteurs so I will not dwell on this in replying but I will make a general reasoning As I said before perhaps removing a few pebbles from my shoe but I think it is legitimate to do so even after the much work done I did not like the acceleration that at some point someone wanted to give to the approval of this bill I did not like it in the way in fact and this is because I have lived it I have experienced this measure strongly the more than 100 hearings the countless round tables with stakeholders and countless comparisons with the social partners and with all the majority forces I therefore found it inappropriate to speed up what we were asked for exclusively in the method because the awareness that work should be done that it should be done quickly but above all that it should be done well we had made it quite clear Mr President No one has ever escaped and no one has ever thought not even for a second of not bringing down the work of four months Then I do not mean how much work we have done and how much has been lost in the reasoning of bringing together in this provision Chamber and Senate to prevent there being alterations of involvement I repeat that I did not like the method I have a clear conscience from this point of view so I feel good about myself I feel like I have to and I 'm somehow convinced that I 'm taking the ball back to the other side of the field Despite all the work that has been done on the hydroelectric on the services on the derivations of gas on the whole part of health care and on everything that colleagues have said this measure seems to be only linked to the seaside world In short I cannot help but talk about it myself from this point of view partly because I am the son of a land that has given so much in terms of receptive activities and bathing Someone said that we all have a little responsibility it is absolutely true as Senator Faith said before and whoever is without sin throws the first stone No one here can throw a stone We 've all put in some of ours I claim Senator Misiani with great force beyond the fact that I appreciated his speech Law No 145 of 2018 I claim it with great force because it was a law that for two years Europe has never contested That is a fact he has never contested it It happened then that politics did not have the strength to finish the job When I said before we made a commitment to Europe and to this bill we kept it I wanted to mean that every now and then when we claim to make delegated decrees we should really do them and I put them all in because it concerned the first and second Count Government Then comes the judiciary which marks a point there again Senator Faith is right the chatter is at zero because a decision of the Council of State has arrived which was very clear Some people like it some people do n't like it some people say it 's not applicable it 's a matter of responsibility because some people have a store with a written above we 're responsible for what we do someone else has a store with a written on it we do n't have any responsibility I do not say that it is illegitimate I say that it is easier to say that on certain aspects and on certain topics it is necessary to do otherwise therefore no to Bolkestein therefore the expropriation therefore you have made an agreement to the bottom of the table therefore you have been dishonest to the country and so on This chatter is at zero because there is a Council of State and the responsibility that every Member of Parliament must assume at this stage is to ensure that those who have such a judgment on their backs are not abusive where they have been working for a hundred years It can never be because if someone comes and seizes that beach then the game is closed At the time we had these three fixed points compensation ensuring that there was a reasonable time even through the hope that the ANCI had put in place when it asked for more time to do things the rewards I cannot dwell on compensation because I can assure you that I too have a clear conscience and I believe that Mr Collina has it with me because at some point in the debate the issue was either residual value or value value and we were firm in words the climate that was created at that time was no longer sustainable We could n't do it Then I say that perhaps at this stage it is better for the Government to deal with it but I would ask for a great effort and a great test of confidence in those who are currently on our beaches set up a conciliation table immediately one minute after the adoption of this bill to start writing together the rules and criteria for compensation because that is where we give great strength to what this Parliament with great difficulty has done I will not dwell on the rewards because they are written very well within the bill small businesses family societies and those with experience are rewarded We also managed as my colleague Collina would say to get away something that was badly written the expression that also included those who had an experience in public goods who wanted to be able to put in even those who have experience in water pipes for example We said it was difficult to give a reward in this sense Well we have done so and we have done much more I shall conclude by making a reflection that may not even be my responsibility in fact but comes from one of the first speeches I heard from the opposition which drew to this very famous unity of the center right Well I accept the challenge but the unity of the center right would have wanted to see it within the Dragon Government to allow the center right to have a wider negotiating force This has not happened and I can not excuse you for this I can't excuse you You have a written sign that is not your responsibility It 's legitimate You will monetize but probably from this point of view the call to the center right was basically out of place
Madam President I do not have much more to add to what Senator Collina said with whom I have played the rapporteur of this bill I am only pleased to have completed a commitment that the Government had made to Parliament and Europe for the PNRR Today we establish this concept and it is a very positive result for all of us
RIPAMONTI L SP PSd Az Madam President this is my first explanation of vote in four and a half years I am doing it at the end of my term and it is a strange and a little anomalous I must say that I am also a little excited that in order to avoid making bad figures at the end I am now announcing my Group 's vote in favour of this measure I would like to take this opportunity once again after having done so at first reading to thank the Commission Mr Girotto who wisely conducted its work Mr Pichetto Fratin who with as much wisdom and also with firmness had the opportunity and the ability to keep us at bay the Undersecretary Bini who with patience kept the barefoot who had put their hands to this measure at bay Finally I would like to thank but not least my co-rapporteur Senator Collina with whom we are honored to have brought to conclusion the provision in the Senate in a not simple and even unusual way As Senator Collina recalled during his report in fact the measure will not see the light with the vote of confidence but through a great process of confrontation within the Groups on a fundamental issue as well as directly for the PNRR which is that of competition The adoption of this draft law is a fundamental act for this legislature and the PNRR tranche As I am in the pre-election period I have a reflection in the following terms The term responsibility is evoked very often even during the crisis of government there were difficulties and everyone said that we had to be responsible and that we had to translate this responsibility into measures so if Parliament had by chance decided to put an end to a moment of community and to go towards the elections because we would have run the risk of not approving the measures Some would say that it was a bit of a path like that of the game Ciapa not the responsibility is yours that you make it fall no it 's mine no it 's that other one's What has happened has happened at last the voters will have the opportunity to make their contribution and decide the next government It is certain that the responsibility of this Parliament has never been challenged because today we are approving the draft competition law We therefore also reject the whole narration that Parliament is made of washing That 's not true we 've taken on our responsibility we 'll continue to work all week we 'll come to the Senate when it 's time to do it because there 's still so much to do Therefore beyond the fact that the elections were held on 25 September this Parliament continues to work and I am very proud to be a member of it Changes have been made in relation to the text approved by the Senate at first reading amendments we hold on to and on which we have worked As my colleague Errani mentioned earlier we have done a great job on the part to me very dear linked to the 'in house of the audience we have reversed the concept for which it was said that everything that is in house is not wrong and that everything that is private is not fair In some way we protect all our communities of mayors and administrators who together have found the synthesis even when they were not together from the political point of view yet have had the ability to form societies that manage our territories well During the examination in the Chamber the fundamental theme was that of taxis which was deleted and I believe that a good job was done He has n't brought a country to its knees and I 'd like to use a term without being accused of saying the wrong things The draft competition law has tried a little to force the hand on some issues including taxis and I must say that without Damocles sword of a ruling of the Council of State on the back Parliament has found its synthesis and made an absolutely conscious choice that is to exclude an issue that from the beginning from the first meetings we held at Palazzo Chigi all the Groups no one excluded had posed as problematic I have to say that there has been an issue that has created some embarrassment in the world of credit mediation and real estate agencies that of incompatibility between the two systems which has never been in question Some time ago a change was made that fortunately in the Chamber through the amendments to the draft competition law submitted by Forza Italia the League and other groups was put in place so incompatibility has failed I also thank all those associations that took charge of being spokesperson first of all the Italian Federation of Professional Real Estate Agents FIAIP which created the conditions for there to be a minimum of responsibility and awareness I do not want to use all the time also because the session is almost over and so I would end with a topic that is very dear to me that of bathing I know that this is an issue that has not been touched on in this branch of Parliament but perhaps a minimum of narrative or rather narrative which brings everything back to a proper dimension must be done There was a law No. 145 of 2018 done well and negotiated with Europe which had the need like today 's competition law to be grounded with the implementing decrees The Count I Government has fallen we do not enter into the merit of why it has fallen although history has said that perhaps it was good to do so and the Count II Government has not closed the implementing decrees So I would have the pleasure to hear once in a while even on the political side that is dearest to me that of center right not only an accusation against those who today as I will say later have secured a section but also against those who have not put down Law No. 145 of 2018 which has a name and a surname and is called Dario Franceschini who was Minister of Tourism I do n't know if the perfect storm was created because then things happened in a rather abnormal way almost as if there were a great director behind it Dario Franceschini did not put down the implementing decrees Europe was mocked rightly because we said things and we did others and at that point when politics does not do things someone else always comes and does them Thus came a decision of the Council of State that said be patient what you have done is not good I disapply Law No 145 and by 31 June 2023 you must go to public evidence Right or wrong political or non-political high or low lean or fat is irrelevant this was the Maginot line we were supposed to be in It is about the sense of responsibility because whether you govern like it or not and leave us blood when you govern in situations like those in which we governed you have to be responsible The sense of responsibility leads you to recognize to the full the cards and rules with which you are playing at that time and the decision of the Council of State is there When someone says I do n't care because we do n't have to go there but we have to go and do this or that I Paolo Ripamonti who grew up on the beach who have friends who do this job and I have people who write to me every day and who insult me a little every day telling me that finally since there are elections on September 25 the package is over I say I am proud to have voted on an amendment that has secured them To posterity the arduous sentence because until proven otherwise until 2024 since the mayors find the strength to do what they had asked so we are not ready to make the auctions we are not ready to make the evidence and ask for an extension in some way are in safety because there are the compensations and there are the rewards These are all things that someone does n't want to see but beyond that because we will be great and win the election and because the coalition will form and at that moment we will all be there and we will all be responsible we will do a great job and all together looking in our eyes we will say this can be done and this can not be done And God we 're all gonna make a decision together
Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government I rise to speak on this decree- law which was fired at 2 p.m. this night by the Commission on the merits which I also thank for having hosted me since the measure contained issues that I was interested in from Liguria and Savona I must thank Deputy Minister Morelli and the Government because they have put the attention on a theme dear to me and to the whole of my Province inserting it within this decree infrastructure that is that of the cable cars of Savona This applause has come from years and years of discussion on the subject I would like to mention first of all that also for the part tied to the railway therefore to the Genoa Campasso project have finally been invested through a fund 98 million euros so I strongly thank the Deputy Minister for this project that is functional from the environmental social and economic point of view and also from the point of view of the ecological and energetic transition Today the Commissioner has all the tools to do so he has 60 days to put all the planning criteria in place and so we are well on track For what concerns the cable car the great news is that within the decree law which has a national breath there is a small part that concerns only one territory but this as I have remembered more than once is a very important infrastructure which has suffered a very serious damage a few years ago because of a landslide that has invested the pylons that support it Today we have put ourselves in a position to have everything that was necessary so that this important infrastructure which it must not be forgotten gives a living to sixty families and which today has become ecologically modern because it eliminates all the road transport from the city can be built We had tabled an amendment which was the son of a great territorial consultation and the great news is that the territory when it finds a minimum of synthesis manages to do things well and to generate proposals even when the people who confront it have different extractions and also politically distant In this case local authorities trade unions employers and even those interested in having a concession tomorrow have come together and produced this amendment The amendment has not seen the light in its entirety but I would like to thank you Mr Vice Minister for this small step we have taken with the rewording in fact once again states if necessary the strategic importance of this infrastructure It is only a small step but I hope and I say this in the pre-election campaign that the next government which I hope is centre right will not miss the opportunity to complete an infrastructure which from the point of view of planning and investment is absolutely necessary I will end by thanking everyone including the entire 8th Commission my Parent Company Senator Simona Pergreffi and Senators Maurizio Campari Gianfranco Rufa and Stefano Corti who have never stopped supporting a small part of our territory which is very important to me
Mr President I should like to thank the rapporteurs Senators Ripamonti and Collina for the great work they have done over the last few months and together with them all the members of the 10th Commission and the various committees which have followed each other and have made their contribution to improving the competition measure Deputy Minister Pichetto and Undersecretary Bini who are always available for a constant and constructive dialogue with the parliamentarians a measure that is improved after the work carried out in the Senate Having seen the work of the last few months I cannot fail to reflect on the separation of powers in our system and in particular on the role of Parliament which is increasingly limited to merely ratifying decisions taken by the Government which should instead be the executive body of decisions taken in parliamentary bodies Certainly the pandemic before and the war now did not help but it had become customary also in the previous legislatures to see an occupation of spaces by the various governments on purely legislative competences on issues that must be dealt with in the parliamentary classrooms by those who are elected by the Italian citizens and represent them If Parliament finds improvements to the text proposed by the Commission we should all work in the same direction The measure in our examination is fundamental to the obtaining of the funds of the PNRR and also to avoid that infringement procedures are initiated against our country It is absolutely necessary however to understand where the balance lies between the interests of Europe and those of Italy because sometimes they are conflicting and a simple flattening on Europeanistic positions does not mean doing the interests of our fellow citizens Ladies and gentlemen we are frank and aware without a reform of the public administration for the simplification of procedures and the deburocratization we will not go anywhere a public administration often oriented towards maintaining its status quo which relieves and dumps on citizens all kinds of burdens and responsibilities almost forgetting that those who choose to work in this area should have as I do the interest of citizens rather than become the office complications simple business Without this reform the valuable work done with this bill will also be watered down In addition to the subject of bathing concessions which has been raised more to the news local public services energy waste transport and health care are among the measures addressed The Members who preceded me and those who will follow will enter into detail and substance of the various issues Personally however I propose a reflection on the companies in house to remember how often the municipalities have often constituted these companies because the market did not offer solutions and it is not or was not economical Just think of the services that connect morphologically difficult territories to reach Parliament 's work has also taken account of these aspects The last thought goes to the great work done on the issues of health where we have tried to find a balance starting from the fundamental need to ensure effective appropriate and safe treatment routes especially in cases of particularly serious and disabling diseases Monitoring and control of all facilities providing health services is essential to ensure the quality of services fair access and eliminate opacity where health services are provided with public finance charges A very important work has been carried out on equivalent drugs to make them readily available while respecting intellectual property rights Research must continue fully in the interests of all Finally starting with the conclusion the Italian blood collection system is an example of excellence worldwide and with the changes introduced the concept of free and voluntary donation is confirmed In these months an important and complex work has been produced in the interest of Italians
"FREGOLENT L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government first of all we should also like to thank Senator Binetti and all the members of the Health Commission for the unitary agenda we are preparing to vote on The themes have been extensively illustrated in the various interventions that have followed and I would like to focus on paediatric tumors sharing a reflection that starts from the love of a parent for his child an unconditional love which cannot be explained but can only be lived You know him when you 're lucky enough to see that baby in your arms for the first time and stays forever That is why it is said that there is no more painful thing for a parent than to lose a child Here is the anomaly the increase of cancers in paediatric and adolescent age The Italian association registers tumors estimates that in the five years 2016 2020 in Italy 7,000 cancers have been diagnosed among children and 4,000 among adolescents between the fifteen and nineteen years in line with the previous five years When you meet one of those parents who have transformed such pain into the mission of a life to help other young lives the question that comes spontaneously is what are the priorities of this country How important is our daily running in the face of the suffering of certain people But most importantly are we doing everything we can on health and research issues We as a group believe not We are convinced that more and better could be done if we were all honest in recognising priorities and working with strict rules to marginalize inappropriateness because every mismanaged resource is a failure to respond to one of our fellow citizens Some of the things we ask for are so basic that it surprises us to have to repeat them In particular I am referring to the correct and uniform treatment of the paediatric oncology patient promoting at territorial level the multidisciplinary approach and teamwork with the presence of several specialists and with the aim of ensuring and improving the psychophysical well being of the patient and his family A survey conducted in Italy by the Soleterre ONLUS Foundation and the Trauma Research Unit of the Catholic University of Milan from November 2019 to September 2021 on adolescents between the ages of twelve and twenty three years at the pediatric oncoematology unit of the Policlinico San Matteo di Pavia showed clinically significant anxiety and depression How could it be otherwise It is already difficult when such oncologic diseases affect as adults let us imagine when one is in the prime of the years The psychological assistance of paediatric patients and their families in the medical oncology departments carried out by qualified graduates in psychology is crucial It is necessary and fundamental however that our country through the action of the Government undertakes to support scientific research The rare disease law is a first step but we need to do more for the development of new therapies allocate funds for innovative paediatric cancer drugs activate experimental treatment protocols and develop clinical trials through a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach In addition it is necessary to provide for the allocation of funds for the economic support of low income households taking into account the costs to be incurred in the case of admissions to care centres away from their residence This last aspect inevitably leads us to the issue of fairness in access to care no one should have a greater or lesser chance of curing himself on the basis of where he is born Parliament therefore has the task of identifying certain rules of accountability and proper use of resources to ensure that all regions offer efficient responses to their fellow citizens without lowering the bar of effectiveness of responses and claiming that the whole chain from the executive summit to the I shall conclude Mr President It must be demanded that the whole chain from the executive summit to the individual socio health worker OSS works in all regions towards a single objective that of guaranteeing the health of each of us For all these reasons I announce the vote in favour of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione on this agenda"
Mr President ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to thank Senator Bergesio and Senator Biti for the work they have done together with all the members of the Commission their respective Presidents and Minister Patuanelli for their attention to the important measure we are considering today The members of the Commission have worked actively and constructively recognizing the serious risk that we are taking As is well known since January 7 last the presence of African swine fever of wild boar in the neighbouring Provinces of Genoa and Alexandria has been detected on the Italian territory We are aware of the details of the disease which have already been discussed in detail by the previous rapporteurs and colleagues The cases found were concentrated in the area between the two motorways A25 and A7 but recently we are witnessing the finding of positive carcasses beyond this perimeter sign that the highways do not represent an obstacle to the movement of wild boars with consequent spread of the disease This requires a reflection on the need to approve the measure in question quickly so that the resources reach the regions in good time just think that we are already in April These are urgent measures aimed at preventing the movement of wild boar by next summer Soon in fact the season of the parts will begin with a doubling of the number of wild boars and consequently starting next June the infection could undergo a significant acceleration determined by the new born That is why the measure we are debating is urgent It is therefore essential to strengthen the fences already present on the roads that delimit the infected area as well as to build ex novo where possible physical barriers that secure the boundaries of the restricted area The fences are certainly the most effective tool to proceed with the containment of wild boars and for this reason have been destined 10 million euros although we are aware that the orographic conformation of the territory will not make it easy to place them There is therefore a real possibility that the virus may spread among wild boars in a much larger area including both particularly rugged mountainous areas of difficult accessibility and with a high intensity of this population and urban areas where wild boars live accustomed to man 's proximity Removable fences and temporary structures must be carried out by the regions concerned by way of derogation from the provisions of the building regulations and those on environmental impact assessment and in the presence of landscape constraints by means of a simplified procedure This step is also fundamental in order to keep the times to the maximum for their realization the times are in fact the crucial factor One of the objectives for which the Commissions have worked has been the eradication of the disease although it is aware that this is an arduous goal which requires seriousness and method in the approach Synergy between the various administrations involved and stakeholders including farmers and hunters will be needed with the depopulation of wild boars In this context leadership and coordination by regions and public veterinary services will be essential The other objective was to protect the Italian pig supply chain and export considering that several countries such as Japan and China but also Taiwan Thailand Mexico Peru Ecuador the Philippines and South Africa have immediately undertaken a protectionist policy and in this sense have closed their market to meat and all pigmeat products The Association of Meats and Cold cuts Assica and the Union national food supply chains meat and eggs UnaItalia estimate in addition to the damages suffered directly by the breeders in the infected areas and in the surrounding areas a damage extended to the meat and cold cuts sector of at least 20 million euros per month only for the failure to export It is therefore not a hunting of wild boars which however if affected by disease would not live in any case but the survival of an entire agri -food sector that is fundamental for our economy and for hundreds of companies and workers who ask us to do quickly The League will continue to work to protect the activities of those living in the red zone and who during this period of the year see different work activities excluded access to parks and various activities related to tourism and hospitality currently in great difficulty In this respect we also had an amendment which we tabled and which unfortunately did not find any room for acceptance This is certainly a measure of common sense and even if criticism arrives because this is the country where it is easier to criticize regardless of building we are interested in intervening and intervening soon so that it is not too late and the costs do not become ten times as much Our response ladies and gentlemen must necessarily be as compact and rapid as possible
"BOSSI Simone L SP PSd Az Mr President we have been following the work of COFE closely both as a party and as a political Commission of the European Union for a long time I therefore think it would be useful to remind this House that this whole series of debates and discussions was initiated at the initiative of the citizens of the Union to enable everyone in Europe to share their ideas and help shape our future through Europe The final result of this great work which involved 52,433 participants on the platform and gave rise to 6,481 online events organized by producing as many as 17,770 proposed ideas collected will be presented next 29 and 30 April precisely in Strasbourg In a few days then we will have a lot of material to discuss discuss and work on for a better future for Europe That is why I naturally ask the House first and then myself whether it would be useful to talk about it today Colleagues I am always very respectful of the work of the Commission and I see in this passage an unnecessary forcing we are bypassing in my opinion somewhat disrespectfully the work that has been started for a long time through a deal assigned to my Commission that of the policies of the European Union bringing to this House today an agenda without taking into account what has been done by our Commission On this desire to put the flag on in the face of all this anxiety of performance I can only make some reflections and I will forgive our figures indicated by the Senate but personally I believe that this strange if not bizarre way of working serves more to some parties of government in order to enhance and give visibility to some senators more than a real necessity in order to face in merit the European future Allow me this to do in the interests of fairness precisely to the Commission and to the work we are doing as the Commission But let us return to the Conference on the future of Europe There has been no lack of criticism on the method rather than on the substance of this amount of work criticism has gone from the way in which European citizens are consulted which on several occasions have complained about the lack of transparency on the promulgation of ideas and the lack of reliability of the effective participation of online events There has indeed been little publicity from the European institutions about the Conference and for this reason in my opinion although the numbers I have read before may seem high there has indeed been little participation a sign of the total sense of remoteness and mistrust on the part of European citizens towards the European institutions themselves It is not just a different Europe that needs different Europeans It could have been an excellent experiment of democracy and transparency in the European Union and a good opportunity but it did not succeed perfectly perhaps also because of the pandemic that has certainly complicated the progress of the work The ideas and contributions collected on the multilingual digital platform covered nine main topics climate change and the environment health stronger economy social justice and employment the European Union in the world values and rights the rule of law and security digital transformation European democracy migration education culture youth and sport Among all these points economic recovery is one of the themes that has recorded the highest participation on the platform given the recent difficulties caused by the pandemic crisis and geopolitical tensions We as League in the various resolutions and motions tabled during this parliamentary term have always stated in writing that it is essential for us to start a debate in order to outline a rethink of the convergence parameters established by the Maastricht Treaty and at the same time to provide for the exclusion of productive investments and those for the security of the territory infrastructure investments and those for the growth of the population concerning the environment from the calculation of the parameters useful to the balance of the budget from the deficit ratio GDP in order to allow also the countries that must pursue the restructuring of the debt to revive the economy by investing in strategic sectors Another topic that we were very fond of was migration many views that emerged in the debate in the Conference call for stronger bilateral partnerships between individual Member States and African countries in order to address migration related issues Concerns have been raised about the risks caused by the extra-European migration flows of European civilisation and political stability Several participants also focused on the use of illegal migration as a weapon I think it is important here to remember the example of Turkey or Belarus It 's important not to forget We as League have repeatedly put down key proposals to rethink the management of immigration in Europe It is essential to combat trafficking in human beings in every possible way It is essential to put at the top of the various migration and security reforms a key principle discouraging departures It is also useful to support the creation in the countries of transit and to belong to special centres where immigrants can be started in order to verify immediately the possible existence of the requirements required to be admitted to the granting of the right of asylum and to commit at European level to the effective compliance with the Return Directive and readmission agreements concluded also at Community level supporting their implementation At the environmental level with the green deal the European Union committed itself to achieving the climate neutrality objective in 2050 and the new European Climate Law which entered into force in July 2021 is precisely the instrument that transforms this political commitment into a binding obligation It is necessary to provide adequate resources to prevent the European plan from turning exclusively into financing to lose the transition in the most polluting countries and an excessive burden instead for other countries in particular for the industrial sector of Italy In terms of energy nuclear energy has been included by the European Commission in taxonomy recognising it as a sustainable technology for achieving environmental objectives The International Energy Agency not the League has highlighted that in order to achieve the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 it will be necessary to increase the share of nuclear energy at global level In this respect it is useful to open a serious debate as soon as possible and no longer ideological Even if this is not contained in the voting system we can not ignore it 11:40 a.m. followed by Bossi Simone Today more than ever these are issues that lead us to a review of the times of the ecological transition in fact after what is happening we believe that it is more than necessary to address them Italy is one of the most difficult countries for the recent crisis in Ukraine and this has highlighted the need to have a secure stable and independent national energy system also supporting the recovery of the technological gap and advanced know how on nuclear latest generation through collaborations cooperation activities exchanges of scientific personnel international and European projects strengthening the institutions that operate in nuclear safety and radiation protection Finally Madam President we can say that the Conference itself was a very good idea but we probably do not think that the experiment has succeeded very well Predicting bottom up participation involving citizens local communities civil society in the process of rethinking and reforming the Union must be the basis for our approach to the European Union of the future It is important on the one hand to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the European institutions giving greater importance to Parliament the only body elected by direct universal suffrage and at the same time to promote greater transparency of the other bodies from the Commission to the various formations of the Council of the European Union I am thinking in particular of the Economic and Financial Council Ecofin an essential institution that decides political and economic strategies of a Member State This and greater bottom up participation that is not one off are ideas of those who really want to improve the European institution For all these reasons we will vote on the majority agenda which partly goes in this direction aware that there are still many issues to be included and discussed at European level"
Minister I would not like to be repetitive because on this subject which is dear to me I made a speech at the end of the sitting a few days ago and something has moved at least in part of our country from the mountain to the plain However the communities affected are still many and there is still a great need for water Today the agricultural world is aware of what is happening and perhaps farmers are the only ones who are really aware of it Unfortunately politics is not unfortunately politics is still coming late If it does n't rain it 's no one 's fault for Christ 's sake and I emphasize it and repeat it But if rainwater as much or as little as it is is always wasted and it has been for decades not since yesterday it is certainly the responsibility of all those who have not wanted to see a bit more of their noses If we turn on the TV and radio every day we hear the usual things the climate is changing the glaciers are melting there is global warming In the midst of all these phrases the only really important thing we do is pretend not to hear them fresh water is a precious asset it is the only good that can give us life today and we are wasting it every day What do we do to safeguard water We have 20 in the North and 40 to 60 in the South Central waste of drinking water due to deterioration of the water supply and nobody does or says anything We only notice the problem when the water is n't there Is it possible that none of the thousands of experts we have in Italy and we really have many experts in everything have ever thought of making a water collection system in the invaders at the lowest point that is the Po Valley They make them in the mountains and we do n't do them downstream And then we complain that the water does n't come from the mountains This is insane Minister I will tell you more at a particular moment like this those few far sighted projects that exist of collection invades realized in the plain that we have done in the fifties and sixties we do not even use them I quote an example that I have before my eyes near my house that I know very well in my territory there is the famous or infamous navigable canal a work never finished started and remained there in the middle of the countryside We 're talking about 13 kilometers of water on concrete shores a 40 metre wide and 4 metre high canal In this phase of severe water crisis in my territory has not been used Do you know why Minister The bureaucracy did not allow use in emergency What was the use of spending thousands of public money on works that are not used in the moment of need You see Minister I am addressing you because you are here although we understand that we are talking about a problem that we have been carrying for years and that persists I do not think we can tell farmers today we did not have any water we do not give you any money and if we give it to you you have to be content with what we are giving you It 's not just uncomfortable it 's also annoying We urgently need a refreshment of all I repeat all the losses of the agricultural world and not as we did with the Covid giving money a lot to everyone throwing billions We need a serious compensation fund I hope it will come as soon as possible because it must be agreed with the trade associations and based on three basic criteria product estimates damage quantification short term and long term repercussions On these three fundamental pillars then we go to compensate for all those activities that have the right to do so not one more and not one less This makes a serious country this makes a serious political class Today 's damage in Italy is estimated at 4.5 billion of these alone in Lombardy we speak of 2.2 billion loss We are talking about 20 percent of companies that have harvested zero The estimate is almost over 20 percent of the total loss and 40 percent of the other farms which is between 35 and 45 percent of the first sowing crop loss If we are aware of the damage that farmers and agriculture are experiencing we may be able to understand what will happen to us shortly And today it is absolutely necessary to help that agriculture and that agricultural world to get out of this drought related crisis If you will allow me Minister with the PNRR we cannot miss the great opportunity to renew our country to the challenges in step with the times not throwing away money in useless projects but investing them in projects that really serve our country
Mr President Mr Draghi I have listened carefully to your words The European Council of 24 and 25 March will address the Russian Ukrainian crisis as one of the topics on the agenda Everyone in this House is well aware that in this sad affair there is an attacking country and an assaulted country However I think it is good to remember that the conflict in Ukraine certainly has historical and profound roots The crisis initially political and later military began with the demonstrations in Kiev in November 2013 a crisis that has brought to light in a striking way one of the many international fault lines that have developed most in the countries belonging to the former Soviet Union The Ukrainian example before our eyes today is perhaps the most symbolically significant and geographically most impactful for the interests of European scenarios in all its drama However the warnings of this crisis had already emerged over the last twenty years throughout the Soviet bloc Therefore in the eye of a careful observer it is important to keep in mind that the Ukrainian scenario risks not being an isolated phenomenon nor even being the last We all know in this House and not only in this House but of course we do not that this crisis could for example spread rapidly into the Asian scenario President Draghi I am sincere and tell you that this seemingly quiet climate does not reassure me but I believe that it is the same for you and your Government Given that the Senate Assembly unanimously wants a ceasefire between the parties I believe that it is right to point out that among the main commitments of the majority resolution assessed and written carefully in the Commissions moreover before the intervention of Ukrainian President Zelensky yesterday there is precisely an indication to the Government to continue in this objective However it should be understood how the European Union can play a diplomatic role and whether the European Union can have the opportunity to play this role With all honesty the Union has not been able to interpret this role of mediation at the moment We have seen a number of unitary attempts by the French President who have not had the outcome hoped for But if Europe really can and wants to play this role it would be extremely useful to understand what the so called red lines for Brussels are at last I believe that an important table such as the European Council to which you will be present is useful in trying to make this summary If as it seems Ukraine 's neutrality with regard to NATO membership is an essential part of Russia and Kiev has also opened up to this condition we must think of a security system capable of defending Ukraine in the short to medium term In this game the European Union must show its will firmly not least in order to be able to effectively speed up the potential negotiation process and stop this useless massacre of lives of civilians that we would never have expected to see in 2022 least after a world pandemic But tomorrow 's European Council will also have the issue of the strategic compass the instrument that contains the European Union 's security and defence programmes Reading the first published document the plan seems extremely ambitious and I do not know whether this is good or bad What jumps at first sight is that it has been clearly accelerated by the new front opened by the Russian invasion in Ukraine and I do not think it is just my impression If you will allow me Mr President in Office of the Council on the issue of the strategic compass and the autonomy of European defence I have a couple of comments that I would like to leave to you and to the House The first point is that although in every document both national and European we hurry to say the opposite the risk of a future overlap between European defence and NATO is already more than clear Let us remember that it is from a European embryo the 1948 Brussels Treaty that the future Atlantic Pact of 1949 then the Atlantic Alliance also arises from the European will to involve the United States in the collective defence of the continent Therefore there is talk of European defence made up of thousands of men and countries in cooperation and not in conflict with NATO It is precisely the robustness of this statement that is not so clear at all as structural anticipations are not clear The second point again on the strategic compass is that we risk making the same mistake again with the birth of the European Union that of starting from the roof and not from the foundations A common defence presupposes a common strategic thought and this at the moment simply does not exist An example of what I am saying is that we saw it at the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis the European Court of Justice rejecting the appeal made by Hungary and Poland has in fact established that Brussels can retain the funding of Member States that violate the rule of law a decision that allows the Commission therefore to potentially suspend payments to Warsaw and Budapest Let us stop and reason on the strategic scope of this European modus operandi a decision that takes place in the midst of the escalation between Russia and Ukraine just when Europe should show itself as a united front and I remind all of you that Poland and Hungary are part of that line from the Baltic to the Black Sea and that it should eventually absorb a potential Russian conventional attack on Europe If the intention of the European Commission at this historic moment is therefore to sanction countries such as Poland and Hungary to which much of the European defence has been entrusted it is objectively difficult to speak of strategic autonomy given the illogical nature of this behaviour Finally with regard to the economic response to the crisis the data are beginning to stabilize and we are confident that this international tension will have a strong impact on our economy Some financial institutions report 1.5 percentage points less than the estimates in the Eurozone and this translates into two percentage points for Italy estimates that are confirmed by the indiscretions we read every day on the national press bodies I say therefore President Draghi let us not be in the same situation as the pandemic originally experienced when we felt that we would face the crisis with a few billion detours Let us get out of a very serious two year economic recession let us be ready to protect our economic system We try to understand how our country can find some opportunities in the medium term especially in the policies of diversification of energy supply The opportunity is provided by the possibility of moving the European political and energy centre of gravity southwards after we have witnessed with the two Nord Stream projects the concentration on the East West energy axis Italy can return to aspire to represent the energy hub of the South North axis by developing relations with the wider Mediterranean front The Foreign Minister 's missions to Algiers as well as the attempts to cooperate with the Mediterranean countries Spain Portugal and Greece which we have witnessed in recent days are good In conclusion I understand that the Government has decided how the Country Italy and Italians must take sides assuming great responsibilities and possibly great repercussions Well Mr Draghi if this is the path the Government intends to take towards peace do so by involving Parliament more closely in every decision because the continuing development of the situation must see us united with a clear mandate to ensure that this responsibility taken at international level must provide first and foremost for the protection of our citizens our businesses and future generations The burden of today 's choices must not and must not fall on those who have already suffered on a people who have been leaving for two very hard years in economic social and health terms Let us take on without hesitation the responsibility to act to protect the families businesses and the spending capacity of our population
BOSSI Simone L SP PSd Az Mr President unfortunately today after just one month of irrigation the situation in Lower Lombardy is before everyone 's eyes It is a situation that I call not serious but dramatic The agricultural world is aware of what is happening and perhaps the only one who realizes it Of course if it does n't rain it 's no one 's fault for God 's sake but it 's not to blame or to find a culprit that I decided to do this surgery I have decided to take the floor today because I am making myself and the House the fear of a whole supply chain the agricultural one that if it does not produce today tomorrow will have nothing to put on our tables Faced with images of dry fields and bare production I wonder why if the agricultural world does not want to give up and is not giving up politics has already given up It is not enough to take refuge behind the compensation measures contained in the decrees that will be issued Northern farmers are still calling loudly speaking for mountain basins to let go of water to save at least that part of production and cultivation that can still be saved today Let 's not talk about 20 years of irrigation and water We 're talking about a few weeks We 're talking about about 20 days of water The day before yesterday I met the farmers from Coldiretti who took me to those camps I saw their frantic eyes in front of the dried crops I have seen in their eyes resignation for the abandonment by the institutions Speaking to them I have decided to speak and to speak in this House Mine is an appeal to the Ministry the Minister and the Presidents of the Region because still a part of the harvest could be saved intervening not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow but today and immediately Eighty percent of the crops of mulched corn and hay fodder are missing at the appeal Stable meadows are permanently compromised and in addition to economic loss we also lose an important biodiversity heritage There will also be serious repercussions for the feeding of herds of cattle and some farms will be forced to reduce the number of animals unable to guarantee their food It is therefore necessary to immediately release all the water invaded in the alpine basins which on June 26 amounts to 182 million cubic metres I say this because there are rules that establish the priority agricultural use of water compared to other uses agricultural drinking domestic and energy use Without food the energy will be of little use We absolutely cannot afford to delay the release of the alpine basins is the largest voice of national GDP

PETRENGA FdI Mr President today we are debating the adoption of an important bill which should not be underestimated even if Article 3 of the Code of Cultural Heritage already provides when it is declared a good of cultural interest that the wording of a national monument is implicit In any case as long as we take care of the valorization of our cultural heritage it is always pleasurable Brothers of Italy has submitted several proposals which are in the acts of the Senate to enhance our heritage to which no response has yet been given despite repeated reminders Coming to today 's bill we accept with pleasure the recognition given because the Arch of Traiano is a monument recognized over the centuries which has attracted so much attention from experts scholars and illustrious visitors so much so that in 1750 King Charles of Bourbon visiting the city of Benevento in front of the Arch of Traiano remained ecstatic to the point of commissioning a canvas to Antonio Ioli an important 18th century viewer to make a painting today preserved in the Royal Palace of Caserta Over the years the Arch of Traiano has undergone several bombings and earthquakes and has always been restored even if with techniques of the time before there was no Charter of Restoration and only consolidation operations were carried out The various restoration works that affected the Arch of Traiano were carried out by the Superintendence to the monuments of Naples and subsequently by the Superintendence of Caserta The Superintendence of Caserta carried out a significant restoration thanks to a project approved with Lotto funds in two phases the first concerned consolidation while the second the restoration of sculptural decorations On that occasion a scaffolding was built to allow the visit to the Arc also with the restoration work in progress In agreement with the municipality was also set up in the nearby Church of Sant 'Ilario an exhibition with panels and audiovisual media that was very successful Therefore it has never been neglected also because the duty of the citizen and the agencies in charge is to enhance and preserve the inherited goods which we have the task of protecting in order to pass them on It is important yes to preserve and protect but after this stage the most important step must come namely the enhancement In the measure I read without commitment of expenditure My point is not to be controversial It is a matter of working with the resources already allocated to the agencies in charge but the Ministry knows very well that the agencies of protection are now in the luminicino There are no funds and therefore more substantial spending commitments are needed to enhance and create promotional pathways I am thinking for example of twinnings with other territories where similar arches are located of the inclusion in international tourist itineraries and of the involvement of individuals to make the Arch of Trajan a great attractor If this were to be achieved we would really have taken a step forward in favour of the territory where the monument insists which is subject to constraints The Superintendence for example has repeatedly invited the mayor to reduce traffic volumes in the street where the monument insists to prevent smog from damaging it There are limits therefore but we must also create advantages making productive for the benefit of the territory the cultural good which must be a call and become the so called great attractor I hope that from tomorrow after the adoption of this measure this path will begin Brothers of Italy is willing to cooperate and I hope that I can see this project realized As far as we are concerned today 's measure must be a starting point and not a point of arrival I therefore announce the vote in favour of the Brothers of Italy Group
