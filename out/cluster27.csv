#MaríaDeLaCabezaRuizSolás,"Thank you President I can't remember what it feels like to be able to walk move your arms talk eat drink and breathe I just remember and I value that I 'm still alive I can see hear feel and just because of those simple things I 'm happy Thank you Jordi Sabate for your example of life and for representing so many who like you demonstrate every day that you are indispensable to a society that often forgets the things that really matter And it 's just that today thanks to you we 're partying in Congress Today thanks to you we make a small parenthesis between so much suffering and so much bad news to celebrate life Today we have the opportunity to take a step forward so that assisted suicide is not the only thing that those who govern us can offer to the sick of ALS to alleviate their suffering and that of their families Everything is thanks to you Jordi thanks to you and to the signatures that you collected and that have made it possible for us today to discuss this bill to guarantee the right to a life worthy of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis How sorry I am that you can't be here with us today as you wished How many barriers we still have to break down A dignified life How well these two words sound together especially after having passed in this very House a shameful law of euthanasia that despises the dignity of the lives of those suffering from a disease offering them death as the only alternative It is paradoxical that today we are witnessing how the very people who argue their support for this terrible law in the name of individual freedom are now talking about helping people with ALS live instead of helping them die The truth is that we would like to think that it is because at least they have understood that one cannot exercise his freedom to die when the only alternative offered to him is death Today we would like to think today we would like to be delighted with the possibility of dreaming that the decision to present at last this law has not been circumstantial that it is a decision of silence a decision that involves a change of mentality a change that has placed the life and dignity of the people in the center and that therefore they have now understood that resources cannot be spared to those who have the courage to fight against an incurable disease to those who refuse to throw away the towel to those who do not want to give up living to the last breath If this was happening if this really was happening it means that the struggle and the unpayable example of heroes like you Jordi Sabate and like Juan Ramón Amores JuanCarlos Unzué Toni García Francisco Luzón and so many others since anonymity have not been in vain and that today opens a door to hope not only to the sick of ALS but also to all the sick who with other different pathologies but also cruel neurodegenerative diseases and other rare diseases also need extraordinary resources to live dignifiedly and not to pose an unbearable economic burden for their families Because it cannot be that in the face of a deadly disease and a hundred per cent disability there is not enough public support It can not be that the survival time of a patient is determined by his or her economic capacity and that a well attended ALS patient with the necessary resources lives better and has more life expectancy than another who does not have them Ladies and gentlemen the average cost for ALS patients to cope with their illness is between € 40,000 and € 60,000 per year That means that the vast majority of these patients cannot face it and this circumstance is inhuman It is inhuman for someone to have to face such a test with the added anguish of not being able to have the resources to do so The same is true of other diseases of invalidants and mortals in many cases of children These people need caring staff who in advanced stages must be qualified health personnel to attend 24 hours a day These people need to adapt their homes need assistive devices articulated beds wheelchairs communication systems they need treatments and care that are essential to be able to stay alive aspiration medication and artificial feeding by gastric tube respiratory therapy not to mention the bill of light which has become a real headache for those who have to stay connected to a machine 24 hours a day It cannot be ladies and gentlemen that only those who have resources can afford to live better and longer In an advanced society the survival of the sick cannot depend on their purchasing power we can not afford it The State has an obligation to ensure with its resources the survival of those who struggle to live because there is no other cause that justifies it any more and not a single euro should be spent on anything else that is not indispensable until there is only one person who needs help to survive not a single euro while there is only one sick person who is not cared for as it deserves because a dignified death cannot be given to those who have not been given a dignified life And of course we cannot allow a single patient with ALS or any other serious illness to let go because he feels that it is an insurmountable expense for his family or a burden for those who leave everything to care for them We cannot afford to spend months until these diseases are diagnosed delaying recognition of disability dependence and incapacity for work because time in a disease with little life expectancy is the most valuable thing these people and their families have Ladies and gentlemen we must all live as a collective failure that the first victims of euthanasia in Spain have been sick of ELA because we will never know if the circumstances of having had no support from your Government conditioned the decision they took We will never know what he would have decided to have known that neither they nor their families would lack resources to live decently to the end Today it is evident that you were mistaken by precipitating your law of euthanasia that the good way was this just the one we started today that in the face of the reality of the suffering that occurs at the end of a person 's life with an incurable disease the human and the just is to do what we are doing today to help live instead of helping to die because that is what we are claiming from those who have inspired this law that we help them to live And if they do not surrender if they overlap with their tragedy if they are able to transform an evil into such a great good and give meaning to their sickness and suffering we cannot fail them They with their struggle have taught us the way today and we as politicians have an obligation to follow it because there is nothing that can make more sense of what we do Ladies and gentlemen this case deserves this bill to come forward unanimously today and our wish is that it be so and that from now on not only the sick of ALS but all those who need it have the resources to live a dignified life And I do not want to come down from this rostrum without paying a small tribute on behalf of my entire parliamentary group to all those who fight for their lives and their families for their unpayable example for teaching us with their courage how insignificant most of our problems are for making us regain faith in humanity and for showing us that life is a treasure in all circumstances that it is a gift that cannot be left unopened that it is a light that always shines and that we must put it in a place of honor so that everyone can see it Thank

#deBertoldiAndrea,"Mr President I would like to speak on the subject of the PNRR by splitting the reasoning into macro and micro-economics I start from the reasoning about microeconomy and I am referring to the first two aspects that each of us should have in mind when thinking about the PNRR I am thinking of the local authorities and I am addressing above all those colleagues who like me live in peripheral situations and are close to the problems of the small municipalities which are the great wealth of our country and know very well how difficult our local authorities are encountering I repeat in the effective achievement of the results of the PNRR I believe that each of you at least once has been called by mayors and local administrators concerned that with their own structures they are unable to respond to the PNRR 's calls and sometimes cannot even fully understand their prospects The first question I have to ask the Undersecretary and the Government is then what is really being done because we are not at the beginning but we are in the middle of the PNRR 's activity There 's no way that so many administrators still do n't know where to bang their heads This is the first point that the Government should keep in mind if it really cares about the good result and especially the good transition in the economy and territories of the investments that could be produced by the PNRR The other sector which is obviously connected to it is the construction sector because we know very well that all infrastructure depends on and is linked to the efficient functioning of the construction sector I would like to open a parenthesis then to remind you that this sector is dying that it is suffering greatly from another lack of government that is the fact that the tax credits linked to the building bonuses are blocked We have dozens of companies that have put workers in cash dozens of companies that can't pay for suppliers dozens of companies that risk bankruptcy And I am sure ladies and gentlemen that like my phone and my computer they are overburdened by the cries of pain of Italian companies and artisans in the construction sector even yours cannot but be equally attentive And what is the government doing Do we really want to kill the heart of Italian construction and then think about realizing the PNRR projects and infrastructure when we no longer have companies Will we take them from France perhaps thanks to those who have privileged relations in France Is that what we want to do Otherwise it is not explained how to combine the blockage to the enterprises through the cessions of the credits with the realization of a PNRR that obviously demands an Italian building capable of carrying out these works The theme is the relationship with SMEs We were taught by the Marshall Plan in the 1950s that a national and international investment plan is effective when the private sector is involved How did you involve our SMEs and when did you involve them They 're in exactly the same situation as those mayors on the outskirts who do n't know where to bang their heads There is another wish that I would like to address to the Government move because time is no longer there I would therefore pass for the sake of time to some reasoning in macro terms I would like to remind you as Gustavo Piga brilliantly explained in an article in the magazine Il Libero Professionista that the provision of PNRR funds is linked and conditioned by fiscal compact Let 's go back to this bad word which has penalized Italy so much for our passivity in previous years Well the fiscal compact that is the famous 3 in the debt to GDP ratio can still condition the disbursement of the funds because Article 21 of Regulation EU 2021/241 the one establishing the recovery plan before the PNRR provides for a suspension of the fiscal compact but this is not normal So today we 're going to be back in the fiscal compact if the government does n't act immediately and we risk due to the obvious impossibility of falling back into the parameters of the fiscal compact to see us block the financing of the PNRR I therefore suggest to President Draghi to read Gustavo Piga 's article and to deepen what the freelancers are emphasizing and screaming moreover in the usual carelessness towards the category which is now a habit Again on these issues what are we going to do about the issue of the economy and inflation Are we going to follow the path of monetary policy as in the United States where inflation comes from an excess of demand or do we think we are going to change strategy because inflation in Italy and Europe is not due to an excess of demand but to a supply shock because of the increase of raw materials So a monetary policy of austerity serves very little indeed creates stagflation We would like to have some answers on this point from Minister Franco and President Draghi we do not agree to move Italy towards the policy of stagflation but we are asking for development policies and therefore we are asking for action with a view to employment I run because I see that time is running thin and I move on to a brief summary to remind the Undersecretary and the Government that the first results of the PNRR are certainly not exciting It also says The Messenger these days talking about the flop of employment centers We should in fact guarantee 16,000 jobs in employment centres so that those receiving the new employment social insurance NASPI and citizenship income can be given work They are therefore 16,000 people to be hired thanks to the 5 billion euros of the PNRR but the Regions have hired only 3,000 of them with a frightening delay moreover in a country that first does the measures that is gives the money and then creates the tools that should have anticipated the measure If for the income of citizenship the employment instruments had previously been envisaged I repeat and only once they had been active had they been expected to be paid out it would have been a reasoning on which one could be confronted The opposite is the case and even with PNRR funds we are not able to hire the professionals needed to create jobs Let 's remember therefore also looking at the simple numbers provided by the Government that in the two years 2020 2021 that is in the last two years the Government of the 15 billion euros of expenditure expected has spent 5 and therefore we have a rate of absorption of the funds of the PNRR that is a third of the planned Would this be the Government of the best which has planned 15 billion euros and spent 5 billion euros in the two year period 2020 2021 according to official data As regards the prospects I welcome the fact that this morning Mr Cingolani finally gave a clear answer on the subject of gas and said in answer to my question in 10a The Commission has finally realised that national deposits must be recovered I am pleased better late than never as I said in the Commission In the answer however the government also says that there is no investment that we must invest to reopen the wells that is not easy because we lack we have deficiencies and we have maintenance to do I would like to ask the Undersecretary what we are doing to ensure that PNRR 's money flows into those gas investments but I am also thinking of rare lands lithium and the great mineral deposits we have in Italy I therefore ask what is being done to invest in the direction of energy autonomy which would be a first response to the geopolitical crisis not to give resources to those who want to wage war such as Russia Mr President in conclusion this would respond above all to the need to give Italians businesses and citizens the energy they need Mr President representative of the Government let us therefore make these investments and try to be more effective than unfortunately despite the constant warnings of the Brothers of Italy Group the majority has been able to do",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,6.6255956,24.554901,27,"mr president would like speak subject pnrr splitting reasoning macro micro-economics start reasoning microeconomy

#BagnaiAlberto,BAGNAI L SP PSd Az I 'm the one who has to release the hemicycle as a senator Can I have three minutes to intervene Can I start over PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator Bagnai I was n't mad at you In fact I was trying to get her to talk quietly Go ahead Senator Bagnai BAGNAI L SP PSd Az Do n't worry my colleagues do n't bother me As they do n't consider me I do n't consider them I would like to make my point thank you Mr President PRESIDENT The debate is closed You 're welcome BAGNAI L SP PSd Az So I go back to saying that if I do n't believe in science it 's because my research work was exactly to doubt it of course by scientific method It is precisely by this method that I documented the effectiveness of vaccinations in my speech of 10 November 2021 referring to the general discussion on the extension of the Covid 19 pass To be precise since there were nine decrees on the pass the intervention was in Decree Law No 172 of 2021 Still in the same debate however I warned against the serious limitations that the reinforced pass showed limits that were already evident at the time because the scientific motivations had long been known It was in fact known at least since July that immunity from vaccine has a short duration and that therefore the vaccinees can become infected as well as they can spread the virus There have been many cases of outbreaks in protected environments such as hospital wards or RSA As a result a measure that gave the illusion unfortunately not the guarantee of finding oneself among non-polluting people could only explode the contagions and for this reason I did not vote for it The facts have conformed to logic The peak of the cases was reached on 14 January 2022 at 177.514 almost exactly the quintuplo of the previous maximum reached at 35.075 on 16 November 2020 My contribution to this debate is summed up in two sentences The first it is clear that the pass is a means that has failed with respect to its stated purpose that of limiting the contagions because it could not fail encouraging careless behavior The second is that it is appropriate to take note of this in order to avoid any doubt that lets it pass instead of being a means is an end I remember Amnesty International paying attention to our country and that the democracy index 2021 places us among the imperfect democracies under Botswana That is also why I hope that the end of the state of emergency will lead to the dissolution of the CTS a CTS that has often misadvised the Government risking undermining its authority and of course the abolition of the Covid 19 pass which in this context has no more reason to be unless its aim is to establish a system of social credits and a capitalism of control contrary to freedom,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,2.1897964,31.060863,27,bagnai l sp psd az 'm one release hemicycle senator three minutes intervene start president debate closed senator bagnai n't mad fact trying get talk quietly go ahead senator bagnai bagnai l sp psd az n't worry colleagues n't bother n't consider n't consider would like make point thank mr president president debate closed 're welcome bagnai l sp psd az go back saying n't believe science 's research work exactly doubt course scientific method precisely method documented effectiveness vaccinations speech 10 november 2021 referring general discussion extension covid 19 pass precise since nine decrees pass intervention decree law 172 2021 still debate however warned serious limitations reinforced pass showed limits already evident time scientific motivations long known fact known least since july immunity vaccine short duration therefore vaccinees become infected well spread virus many cases outbreaks protected environments hospital wards rsa result measure gave illusion unfortunately guarantee finding oneself among non-polluting people could explode contagions reason vote facts conformed logic peak cases reached 14 january 2022 177.514 almost exactly quintuplo previous maximum reached 35.075 16 november 2020 contribution debate summed two sentences first clear pass means failed respect stated purpose limiting contagions could fail encouraging careless behavior second appropriate take note order avoid doubt lets pass instead means end remember amnesty international paying attention country democracy index 2021 places us among imperfect democracies botswana also hope end state emergency lead dissolution cts cts often misadvised government risking undermining authority course abolition covid 19 pass context reason unless aim establish system social credits capitalism control contrary freedom
