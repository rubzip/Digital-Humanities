#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President I would like to declare the vote in favour of amendment 3.0.121 which like other precedents recognizes to those who are suspended by the service the recognition of the food allowance as for those who are suspended due to criminal proceedings In other words we demand that those who have been suspended for the imposition of health treatment enjoy at least the same treatment as those who are suspended for criminal proceedings i.e. they are treated as possible criminals possible because criminal proceedings are still in progress I think it would be appropriate for a minimum of fairness and humanity,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-22.116611,-5.310149,38,mr malan fdi mr president would like declare vote favour amendment 3.0.121 like precedents recognizes suspended service recognition food allowance suspended due criminal proceedings words demand suspended imposition health treatment enjoy least treatment suspended criminal proceedings i.e. treated possible criminals possible criminal proceedings still progress think would appropriate minimum fairness humanity
