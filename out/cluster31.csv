#RicardoChamorroDelmo,With all due respect Madam President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The draft Organic Law amending the Organic Law 10/1995 of the Criminal Code on Animal Abuse is based on wrong principles which in the opinion of this parliamentary group require that it be returned to the Government from which it comes For starters the urgency procedure is unnecessary and not justified The most serious of the arguments against this bill is the animalistic spirit that informs the articulated one and that is paired with the purpose of continuing with the implementation of its globalist agenda at the anthropological level an approach that entangles to perfection with the spirit of the Law 17/2021 of amendment of the Civil Code the Mortgage Law and the Law of Civil Prosecution on the legal regime of the animals which voted in favour of all of you and to which only VOX opposed and which has a vision of nature linked to the urban world that identifies the animals with the pets Both this draft amendment to the Penal Code and the animal welfare bill discussed earlier are lethal to a rural world that has been transformed and managed by man for thousands of years based on a completely different anthropological vision from that which we want to impose with these rules What is the nihilism we are talking about It is an international movement organized and financed by billionaires of the global elite in order to impose a new moral order in the world in the relationship of man and animals so that the world is more culturally flat more homogeneous a sort of unique thought without criterion without the certainties that the tradition truth and common values provide us This parliamentary group considers animal abuse of course to be a social evil but not because animals have rights which constitutes a philosophical and legal disparate but because abuse constitutes a profoundly incisive and denigrating conduct of human moral dignity The current regulation of our Penal Code offers adequate protection to animals in order to prevent their abuse It does so by distinguishing the legal consequences of criminal action according to the type of animal because it understands that the care of domestic and wild animals must be different in attention both to the particularities of their species in relation to man and to the context in which they live No law can depart from the reality of what animals are in themselves from what they are for the human being and from the treatment that in keeping with the above man must dispense us in fact the above is the doctrine of all European comparative law This bill eliminates the distinction between domestic and wild animals and speaks only of the abuse of vertebrate animals without distinction or exception It is absolutely false that the German and British laws include without exception all vertebrate animals within the concept of animal abuse It is a shame that this falsehood is incorporated into the explanatory statement This legal text has been criticized both by the Attorney General 's Office and by the Ministry of Agriculture itself It is curious that those politicians who consistently claim principles such as the minimum intervention of criminal law orientation to reintegration the criminal as the last resort to which to resort those who call for the approximation of terrorists and who refuse to increase penalties for rapists terrorists or abusers or those who pride themselves on the decriminalization of abortion demand absolutely disproportionate penalties for all these animal related criminal types The draft organic law is a serious violation of the principle of proportionality since the penalties proposed for the crime of animal abuse are to a large extent consistent with those provided for in our Criminal Code for the crime of human injury The project introduces the use of firearms as an aggravating factor in the crime of animal abuse A clear purpose is understood in all this to end kinegetic management hunting This purpose has been expressed by the Government along with the end of the bullfighting and other cultural and sporting shows rooted in our tradition with the aim of making minimalist court arguments no matter how much the PSOE tries to disguise with stagings that do not deceive anyone at all In short we are faced with a text that manifests an obvious philosophical and legal disorientation animalist decentralized from man and disconnected from reality that summarizes globalist ideology like the rest of the laws discussed today in this Congress and that incurs obvious errors of legal technique What we want in the VOX Parliamentary Group is to decide whether we want to defend the conservation of nature and animals from the point of view of common sense or whether we want to defend that roosters rape chickens based on these absolutely schizophrenic ideologies or on these laws that they claim to dehumanize man and humanize the animal Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,26.269106,-26.791718,31,due respect madam president good afternoon ladies gentlemen draft organic law

#ÁngelLópezMaraver,Thank you very much President Good morning This bill on animals is one of the greatest ideological nonsense discussed in this House Humanizing the animal and animalizing the man pretending to grant rights to the animals is an absolute desatino liquidating the natural position of man and subjecting him to the global Marxism to which you are kneeling which paint beautiful with a reddish colour and make him call Agenda 2030 Giving rights to animals is an irrationality in the category of pretending that the sun is the moon and the moon is the sun The law since man is man serves to regulate human relations and those of these with the world and animals by their very nature do not fit in the condition of men A living being who has no natural capacity to acquire commitment or obligation cannot by its own existential reality acquire rights comparable to persons His ideological sectarianism is absolutely fallacious This government is at the service of the economic interests of the globalist progressive consensus elites to whom animals care little or nothing You are mere servants at your service and it is such servileness that you dare with the folly of giving false rights to those who cannot acquire obligations And they cannot because they lack will because they lack the capacity to decide They lack responsibility because they are not aware of their actions lack the power to know and recognize that they have rights and finally lack the power to demand the fulfilment of their rights VOX not only rejects this text in its entirety because it intends to grant a Pharisee rights to animals but also because it establishes a system of obligations restrictions prohibitions and sanctions that pose a serious danger to the whole social economic and cultural sector with which we live with which we are with which we have sat and listened Everyone who really loves the animal begs us please to get them out of this fanatical norm that no one wants to be in With this law they condemn to death quickly and without social consensus hence their treatment as a matter of urgency the most representative sector of our being the sector from which we all come the rural world A few days ago Mrs. Belarus dared to say that the children belong to no one Similar obstinacy has already implemented it in this norm with pets The Project does not speak at any time of ownership of the animal it constantly speaks of adoption foster care or protection Dona Ione anyone who professes a minimum of love for their animals feels them as their own the seven members of their family but you do not understand the two most important things in life love and family They talk about animal welfare and take away all dogs and cats the meaning of their existence reproduction Are you going to sterilize them from your earliest age Do you really think that depriving them of their being is giving them a right Will they ban a bitch from getting pregnant and fine her owners with 50 000 euros for consenting to it or not making a remedy and yet we allow a 15 year old girl to kill the embryo of a life that as it is not hers gives her burial This is a genuine communist hypocrisy They have passed a law of free mortality for the elderly who are older or for the unlucky sick who have been tired of caring however they prohibit the euthanasia of an animal for old age illness or injury with possibility of treatment or palliative care article 27 paragraph a of their body of law Taking a course to have a pet is a trial to deprive us of the freedom to have children and another contradiction of this extravagant bill Depriving an elderly woman of the only thing that makes her company depriving her best friend of a pastor who is alone on the mountain ending the company of many people for not being able to study or devote time to her sectarian course is another of her contradictions In March in Madrid there were more than half a million people making them see that the more than ten million people in the countryside and mainly hunting who today accompany us in this rostrum do not want a law that is an attack on their entire flotation line They intend to make us believe that this rule does not affect hunting but as always they lie The law prohibits savagery and condemns hunting dogs ferrets and mackerel articles 25 39 and 40 This is gentlemen of the PSOE and Podemos an uncovered ban on kinegetic activity Their ignorance and ignorance of the rural world make them not aware that a hunting dog can get away from its owner and wrest a duel with a wild animal with this rule they will label it as abandoned or abused animal and they will remove it with the consequent penalty for serious infringement The PSOE sells that hunting dogs stay out of this law another counterfeit typical of remedial socialists Do you really believe that hunters do not know that the amendment tabled is an electoral measure aimed at not losing the rural vote Socialists if there 's any word left for them please comply with this plan and do n't get carried away by the communist fanaticism of those who put underwear on dogs and put cats to bed in baby cots Scientists rural dwellers circus and pet people associations brought together by nature and animals and people of the city who love animals know that there is nothing more natural and exceptional

#ÁngelLópezMaraver,Ladies and gentlemen of the United Parliamentary Group We can all they tell us is a fallacy because they care very little about animals their welfare and their conservation As I have already said you are only interested in your ideological sectarianism in being at the service of those who lead you and in the progressive consensus that has invented the new religion of mascotism and animalism as a dogma of faith to generate commercial interests that ultimately have an impact on the dignity of animals What they have told us in a zalamera way is but a unique strategy and exclusively for their own interests that consists in ruining the countryside its people and its animals This law is a faithful reflection of the Machiavellian infrastructure of placement of friends that began with a Ministry of Social Affairs and Communist Agenda and another of Equality which continued with a poorly called General Directorate of Animal Rights and which now intends to create structures as one of its former leaders yes Mr Errejón was already advancing us in 2018 and I quote textually when we lose elections we must leave seeded popular institutions that resist and where to take refuge when governing the adversary There is a need for an autonomous economic infrastructure that will allow for example a large part of the militant cadres that are now engaged in institutional work In this bill they have not created one or two garitos for their militancy but have allowed the luxury of creating more than ten models of placement agencies the State Council for Animal Protection the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Protection and Rights of Animals the central system of registers for animal protection the registration of entities for animal protection type RAC RAT RAS GCOF and DEF the professional register of animal behaviour the registration of pet zoos or the registration of pet breeders Is it true that with all this conglomerate of entities they claim that the Spaniards believe that you are interested in animals The only thing that interests them is the economic amount they generate Do you think you 're going to believe that cutting the testicles or amputating the ovaries to a dog or a dog is for your animal welfare and yet amputating the ears or the ass is abused when done for strictly sanitary reasons Do you consider that the Spaniards are going to believe that this is a law against abandonment when the director general of the bad management of animals this week has confirmed that there is no official data on abandonment in Spain Do you really believe that the ban on raising animals by private individuals is for animal welfare or is it that the breeding is only going to be able to make entities that you control Do you think Spain is going to believe that the ban on the sale of animals in specialised stores is for animal welfare and not for its economic interest Do they really want us to believe that hunting dogs will be unprotected if they remain outside the law when the Penal Code itself already punishes the ill treatment of pets with fines prison sentences and years of disqualification Do you really think that the rural world believes that including hunting dogs in this law is for animal welfare or are you really going to believe that this is an uncovered ban on hunting Since when does a mascot law de facto prohibit traditional sports modalities such as wildlife or pichon shooting Since when does a mascot law intend to limit an activity such as cetera declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO Ladies and gentlemen stop fooling us After seeing in article 27 of your bill the such nonsense of saying that the procedure of assisted death of an animal must be with methods that guarantee your humanitarian condition you can expect anything I do n't know if they want to laugh at us or if really they 're capable of believing their own lies The amendment to the Criminal Code ladies and gentlemen is another of the follies that this Government has tried to bring us on 1 August through the urgent procedure in a completely unjustified and unnecessary way They know that the current regulations in our Penal Code already offer adequate protection to animals in order to avoid their abuse Article 337 of the Penal Code assumed that Spanish legislation was one of the most protected in this area Gentlemen of the government are you going to have a person in prison who kills a chicken in his house to eat it Is anyone going to jail to kill a rat who 's sneaked into his house Are you going to condemn for animal abuse someone who runs over a bird or any other wild animal According to their bill these people are going to jail The project by extending the definition of animal abuse to all vertebrate animals poses a serious threat to hunting fishing and a range of activities in the rural world I have said this with the law on animals and I repeat this with the amendment of the Penal Code it is a ban on open ended hunting a real ruin for those who dedicate themselves to animals and a condemnation of the extinction of the rural world Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,26.122002,-26.628689,31,ladies gentlemen united parliamentary group tell us fallacy care little animals welfare conservation already said interested

#ArrigoniPaolo,"Mr President representative of the Government ladies and gentlemen this aid decree is the ninth measure providing for measures to deal with expensive energy and expensive fuel To date overall more than 33 billion are allocated These in summary are the measures introduced by the measure For companies tax credits for electricity and gas consumption expenditure in the second quarter are increased there are additional extraordinary contributions to local authorities to cope with increases in bills 150 million to municipalities 30 million to provinces Against the expensive fuel for the hauliers there is the tax credit of 28 percent of the expenses incurred for the purchase of diesel but carried out only in the first trimester of 2022 Against the spiral of inflation there is the recognition of the 200 euro bonus to an audience of 31 million Italians Then there is the extension to the third trimester of the zeroing of the system charges in the electric bills for all the utilities the reduction of the system charges in the gas bills the VAT facilitated to 5 for the consumption of natural gas for civil and industrial uses Also in the third quarter there is the extension of the social energy bonus to families in economic difficulties and for citizens in serious health conditions we speak of 5.2 million subjects For access to this bonus wanted by the League which has made it a battle of equity and justice the retroactivity has been added with the compensation of the automatism after that we had denounced how the automatism itself at the beginning was valid only for the perceptors of the income of citizenship while for the remaining families in economic difficulty many of which unaware of the right of the benefit and that in these months they have continued to pay very salty bills ran the obligation to present to the Municipality the unique substitute documentation an unacceptable discrimination that we have now removed for the benefit of millions of families Other significant measures of the decree law are the commissioners for the two floating regasifiers of Piombino and Ravenna the ulterior simplifications for renewables and energy communities something on the superbonus and the cession of the credits 3 billion against the dear materials for the public works there is also the management of the waste in Rome with the thermovaluer that we trust is realized as soon as possible to remove the shame in which the capital has been pouring in for too many years Not everything however is smooth with the rewording by the Executive of a parliamentary amendment to the House the de minimis for the recognition of tax credits for gas and electricity purchases has been incredibly introduced it is a rule that has left us unhindered for approximation and that has thrown companies into panic It is as unacceptable as the government while with one hand it provides the tax credit to give a breath of oxygen to companies with the other instead they tell me to the Department of European policies it intends to compress if not even zero these same benefits turning its back on the enterprises moreover in this period of dear energy in which Europe has also expanded the links in the matter of state aid The constraint therefore is absolutely to be removed because the de minimis provides for the maximum amount of aid that can be obtained at EUR 200,000 but on a three year basis and for all companies belonging to the same group and the figure of EUR 200,000 is currently absolutely inadequate for the purpose of supporting companies The commitment of the MEF even at the urging of Minister Giorgetti to carry out the corrective intervention after the request of the League is important but the time to implement it is limited If the distortion is not removed by July 16 the day after tomorrow the companies already heavily affected by the expensive bills will not be able to compensate for the tax credits accrued in the second quarter so they would suffer further financial difficulties not counting then the problem of the credits already used in contrast to the norm that has occurred Another absurdity that has happened is that while the Government has extended for another three months this on 30 June therefore until September the VAT facilitated to 5 for the consumption of natural gas for civil and industrial uses measures in force since October 2021 here comes to surprise the Agency of revenues which in fact with its own interpretation wants to put its hands in the pockets of the Italians asking for the return of part of the facility Last July 7 the Agency ruled going in our opinion against a clear principle of Union matrix that the reduced rate of 5 applies only to the raw material commodity but cannot extend to the ancillary services or the fixed quota of the tariff in fact requiring the sales operators who are now in total panic to correct all invoices issued so far since October 2021 charging the retroactive tax to users Who now tells the Italians that they will have to pay 17 of VAT on more than 50 of the bill All this moreover with retroactive effect from 1 October On this point it is absolutely necessary for the Director of the Agency to take the matter into his own hands and to revoke the interpretation of his offices On the front of energy security and relief from Russian gas the Government and Minister Cingolani are doing so much but on the front of the dear energy in spite of geopolitical events the instability of the markets the difficulty of supplying gas in these days we also have the stop of supplying Russian gas through the Nordstream Mr President I can not move forward I ask you whether you can take a break and resume my speech later PRESIDENT

#ArrigoniPaolo,"Mr President representative of the Government ladies and gentlemen this price cutting decree has been the sixth measure since the second half of last year which provides for measures to deal with expensive energy and expensive fuel To date the total amount is 22 billion of which more than 5 in this decree Compared to expensive energy these are in summary the measures introduced in the measure First of all there is the reduction until next July 8 of excise duties on petrol diesel and LPG a measure that makes us particularly satisfied since the League with a motion at the beginning of March was the first political force to urge the Government to introduce it Contributions were then raised in the form of a tax credit for energy and gas companies for the increased costs incurred in the purchase and use of electricity and gas For the first time the tax credit for higher electricity and gas costs by small and medium sized enterprises was introduced Also important is the tax credit of 20 for the purchase of fuels in the first quarter 2022 for the exercise of agricultural and fishing activities For the period April 1st to December 31st the value of the ISEE was extended to 12,000 for access to the social bonus water and light gas from families that I remember has been enhanced since October 2021 The audience of the beneficiary nuclei thus rose from 4 to 5.2 million On the social bonus and energy poverty I remember that the League denounced that automatism was valid only for the recipients of citizenship income while for the remaining families in economic difficulty many of them unaware of the right to benefit and that in these months they have continued to pay very salty bills ran the obligation to submit to the municipality the unique replacement documentation with the indication of their incomes and assets with the addition to benefit of the bonus only from that moment on It is an unacceptable discrimination which thanks to Minister Giorgetti we have removed with the so called aid decree with which in addition to automation retroactivity with compensation for the social bonus has been introduced for all We have won a battle of justice and equity During the conversion unfortunately once again the financial space available to Parliament has been almost null and void Noteworthy however is the confluence of Decree Law No. 38 of 2 May 2022 which led to the extension of the reduction of the excise duty on petrol and LPG to 8 July but for the first time it also introduced measures in favour of the gas supply chain for automotive literally on the knees for months Well not only the zeroing until 8 July of the excise duty of the gas for automotive but above all after the League from October 2021 had repeatedly requested it with several amendments also the application of the VAT facilitated to 5 of the gas for automotive like what is being done for gas for civil and industrial uses since October With the same determination we will continue to insist that the 5 reduced VAT can once and for all also apply to district heating services and energy service contracts where gas is indirectly used for house heating Always in good conversion the amendment of the League that allows in the agricultural field to take advantage of the full use of the technical capacity of the installed plants of production of electricity from biogas Before concluding I have to make two comments the first concerns the introduction of the tax on extra-profits made by companies engaged in energy activities Of course with high energy there are subjects that have been extravagant for months Therefore a rule that provided for an extraordinary solidarity levy served and indeed was necessary but it had to be fair and just as is not the article 37 of the decree law that instead has many distorting elements that risk to severely penalize some enterprises The rule does not take into account the excise duty paid the extraordinary transactions the financial derivatives to cover the risk where instead the banks are the protagonists hitting only the physical contracts The League with all rejected amendments not only asked to remove these distortions but also proposed to widen the audience of those who have to pay the tax also to banks and financial intermediaries operating in the energy sector with financial contracts and derivatives Incomprehensiblely however this proposal has also been rejected heard out of honesty a serious mistake because the approval of our amendment would have guaranteed not only greater revenues to the State and consequently the distribution of profits to millions of Italians but also to cover the burdens to remove distorting effects contained in the penal law for several companies that will probably be led to recourse to the Consulta The question arises spontaneously was the involvement of banks costly for the State we say absolutely no or for Draghi We hope that with the so called aid decree where the tax has been announced to rise from 10 to 25 it will run for cover As far as the second and last reflection is concerned all the measures launched so far zero charges for electricity and gas bills reduced VAT at 5 for gas social bonuses tax credit for companies for electricity and gas consumption and finally the reduction of fuel excise duties are covered up to the second quarter and therefore until 30 June 8 July for the reduction of excise duty The so called aid decree does not extend these measures from the advance notice and is a major problem Since the dear energy aggravated by the Ukrainian Russian war has structural characteristics and continues incessantly with prohibitive prices the government will play force within a month will necessarily have to introduce another substantial measure that extends to the third trimester the measure to protect citizens of the enterprises and the economic recovery penalty the crisis It 's gonna take several billions It is likely that we will need a new set of debt interventions of course also in the Community where Europe is called upon to play its part If Brussels with the recovery fund has allowed debt to be paid for the ecological and digital transition there is no reason to avoid this tragedy that has been affecting families and entire production sectors in crisis for almost a

#CirianiLuca,Mr President I would like to take advantage of the presence of Mr Patuanelli to explain Amendment 1.10 which basically calls for the price of agricultural gas oil and for fisheries to be reduced Because very often in this House so many colleagues especially the members of the Agriculture Commission have denounced the sudden increase in fuel costs due to the Ukrainian crisis which we all know and as this violently and dangerously impacts on our production chains today with this amendment we have an opportunity I therefore ask the Government to evaluate the amendment proposal at the first signature of Senator Ciriani with whom as I said it is basically asked to reduce the prices of agricultural gas oil for fisheries and for the agri-food chain and to eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies SAD in order to further reduce the charges on fuels used by the supply chains I would ask the Minister who is here to give a favourable opinion because apart from his intentions and good intentions I believe that it is also appropriate and fundamental to give concrete signals and this amendment goes in this direction Thank you for your attention Minister,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,30.520544,-19.551714,31,mr president would like take advantage presence mr patuanelli explain amendment 1.10 basically calls price agricultural gas oil fisheries reduced often house many colleagues especially members agriculture commission denounced sudden increase fuel costs due ukrainian crisis know violently dangerously impacts production chains today amendment opportunity therefore ask government evaluate amendment proposal first signature senator ciriani said basically asked reduce prices agricultural gas oil fisheries agri-food chain eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies sad order reduce charges fuels used supply chains would ask minister give favourable opinion apart intentions good intentions believe also appropriate fundamental give concrete signals amendment goes direction thank attention minister
#TosatoPaolo,TOSATO L SP PSd Az Mr President Government ladies and gentlemen it is clear to everyone that this vote of confidence is not like everyone else but it can lead to the fall of this Government and the resignation of President Draghi and who knows perhaps even at the end of this parliamentary term We will vote for confidence we will vote for it mainly because the measures contained in this decree law are useful I would say more they are necessary to the country in this dramatic situation Removing trust in a government is a legitimate choice doing so on this measure is irresponsible Not trusting the Government today means saying no to energy measures to protect households and businesses it means no to zeroing the electricity sector 's system charges for the third quarter of 2022 it means no to reducing VAT to general charges in the gas sector it means no to tax credit for businesses road hauliers the fishing sector and the purchase of energy gas and fuels It would mean colleagues saying no to new rules to facilitate and accelerate the production of gas in our country and energy from renewable sources Not voting for this confidence also means saying no to measures to support companies liquidity which we know is necessary It means saying no to measures in the field of social policies measures in favour of territorial authorities regions provinces and municipalities and to all the amendments that parliamentarians approved in the House with the consent of the Government improving this decree law It means ignoring the work done by Parliament more than 20 billion Then it means questioning the next decree- law the one at the end of July announced by the Government and in which we put a lot of trust additional resources to face the most dramatic situation that our country has lived since the post war period Is it easy to be part of this government and support it Certainly not Certainly it is not for us for the League a political force that has nothing to do with the policies of the Democratic Party the 5 Star Movement and LEU However it was a choice dictated by necessity there was no clear majority in this legislature it was necessary for each of us to assume responsibility on the basis of our own possibilities and the situation we were experiencing We are experiencing a dramatic situation not only because of the pandemic but above all because of the consequences of the war in Ukraine Unimaginable scenarios have developed in this legislature and others we hoped would be handed over to history New commercial economic and political walls have been erected with dramatic consequences for families and our economic system The dear energy of light gas and fuels is such a serious phenomenon that every attempt to contain it is still insufficient and inadequate at present despite the tens of billions allocated by the Government to contain its effects there is still no favourable solution to protect families and businesses Who would politically want to be dealing with this situation today Who would want to be responsible for dealing with these emergencies It is clear that it is difficult for everyone it is difficult for the League but it has chosen to give its support to the Government Dragons and has always done so with the utmost commitment of its Ministers and its parliamentary groups to the House and the Senate We did not escape this responsibility because the time was and is exceptional It was certainly easier to stay on the sidelines to the opposition to criticize what the government does or does not do it would have been a certainly more profitable choice at the electoral level a choice of convenience but useless to try to resolve the dramatic situations that our country is experiencing We prefer to put ourselves to the test every day in the Commissions and in the House in order to improve the measures of this Government It is certainly easier to abandon the game now escape and escape from their responsibilities at a time when a very difficult and very heavy autumn is announced for those who will have to take political decisions I do not want to judge the behaviour of a Movement that has decided to take away the trust of the Government but a request I feel to do it do it responsibly do not put at risk the approval of this and the next decree law and the allocation of tens of billions necessary and useful to families and businesses I shall end this speech President with a few requests from the Government if there is one more Much has been done over 33 billion to try to curb the increase in gas and fuel bills much but not enough beyond the good will and commitment of Parliament and the Government What 's missing First of all for us we need the tax peace and the dismantling of the debitory records We cannot think that in the face of this crisis and all the increases many Italians who have always fulfilled their duty who are not tax evaders and who have endured the most severe economic crises are also facing the arrival of tens of thousands of tax collectors We need common sense we need responsibility And then we also ask for the solution for those who have invested in the 110 building bonus it takes balance This measure comes from an earlier government He probably made mistakes but expectations have been created Investments are being made by companies and households which cannot be abandoned halfway We must accompany them with the necessary investments and find a solution We are asking for a correction of citizenship income Colleagues it is creating major problems instead of creating employment it is driving people away from the world of work who could find employment in the tourism and agriculture sectors there is a shortage of staff yet expenditure on citizenship income increases There 's a short circuit that needs to be corrected There is the very serious theme of the purchasing power of Italian families The increase in energy costs has shown how much purchasing power is absolutely inadequate there is real inflation that we consider more than 10 and we need to intervene to protect the purchasing power of Italian workers and pensioners The Government has started this debate the League will be present and participate with concrete proposals to restore dignity to the purchasing power of families As for the subject of energy self sufficiency we believe in investments we are not the party of the no to everything the thermo- valuers regasifiers and instruments that give energy self sufficiency to our country We also call on the Government to seek with greater conviction at European and international level the way to find the end of this war which has led to energy increases that we are unable to withstand The war is hurting everyone and our country perhaps more than others President the League has been and is loyal has accomplished and will carry out until the end of this parliamentary term its duty to protect families jobs and businesses If however the conditions are no longer met take note of them and vote on them The dramatic situation in the country cannot wait for the slow and cumbersome responses of

#BalboniAlberto,Balboni FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen allow me first of all to thank President Ostellari the rapporteur Senator Cucca and all the Members of the Commission because I am the first signatory to this bill but in fact the text is the work of the whole Commission in particular the Committee which has worked on it and which has received so many important suggestions to dismiss a text that is more important than we can believe The nautical traffic in fact in recent decades but especially in recent years has become very intense our beaches our shores our coasts our sea are frequented for many months a year by millions of bathers users diportisti not to mention of course all the commercial traffic also in exponential increase All this of course involves an increase in the risks that a motor vehicle even if it travels on the water can represent for others that are found on other motor vehicles and especially for those who are in the water I believe that we have all witnessed absolutely dangerous and imprudent behaviors we have seen very often on our beaches jet skis dinghy or outboard arrive up on the beach at full speed perhaps sometimes slaloming among bathers even among the children who bathed a few meters from the shore and unfortunately every year there are fatal accidents or even if not mortal very serious because the impact of a propeller on a person sometimes leaves signs for life and disability even very serious These are injuries that very often lead to a permanent disability even very high It was therefore necessary to fill what the rapporteur rightly pointed out as a vulnus a deficiency in our judicial system because it is obvious that the feeling of justice of all of us rebels when he sees such a different treatment of manslaughter or serious manslaughter affecting the same identical protected legal good which is the life and safety of people We do not understand why if murder or injury is caused by violating the rules of the road code we can reach even very high penalties in the presence of aggravating agents such as driving in a state of drunkenness while if we violate the rules of the navigation code we must apply a completely different discipline so even as other colleagues before me remembered in the end we reach a sentence of a few months It is news of a few days ago the sentence of the court of Temple Pausania that sentenced to eight months of imprisonment with all the benefits of law conditional suspension the driver of an outboard who killed a diver while he was fishing underwater a few meters from the shore with his signal balloon Imagine the consternation of family members children wife in the face of such a low penalty These are really unacceptable things So there was this gap to be filled Obviously we cannot say that by approving this bill we will get the result of solving immediately the danger for anyone entering the water or staying at sea because there is cultural work education and prevention to be done Exactly as for road users even those who go to sea must do a work of education and awareness Very often in fact those who go to the sea today can lead a boat up to 40 horses without any notion without knowing the rules without even knowing how to conduct that vehicle just go to the first boat and rent a boat of this kind It would be like allowing a person without a driving licence to be able to drive on the streets of our city a utilitarian even not small because the outboards today are very powerful and too often are manipulated to increase its power Clearly then there is a much broader speech to be made As the establishment of road murder has led to a significant reduction in serious serious and especially fatal accidents I am convinced that if properly advertised the establishment of nautical murder will also bring a benefit It is clear that if above all young people and young people but in any case people who have no idea of the dangers they cause by carrying a boat especially close to the shore know that instead of risking six months eight months a year with the conditional especially if they have abused alcohol or drugs with this bill if as I hope it will also be approved in the other branch of Parliament perhaps before the beginning of the bathing season they risk a few years they will inevitably be led to greater prudence and greater esteem of the actions they are doing I repeat this is a bill that I am happy to have produced as input but it is the result of all the political forces present in the Commission who have all worked together to get to this text It is important that together with this result we have also had the opportunity to take advantage of the invitation that the Court of Cassation made over a year ago to change the persecubility of road injuries at this point also nautical As the Supreme Court has said in that famous sentence it is unreasonable that there is always and in any case the persecubility of office and we have also intervened on this aspect Among other things it is a reform that was already brought forward in the delegation law that we approved a few months ago so the injuries that have not been aggravated by this reform will be prosecuted and will no longer be prosecuted automatically This will also make it easier to obtain compensation for the damage It is clear that very often to the injured to those who have suffered a injury we are talking about injury not murder instead of a penalty that then remains 99 percent of the time only written in the criminal certificate and does not go beyond the most important thing is to obtain compensation for the damage he has suffered With this change we make it even easier to make a path that leads to compensation so also as my colleague Ruspandini pointed out earlier to a greater lightening of the burden of our courts that as we know already have enough to do without overloading of further trials issues that can be resolved between the parties Mr President I should like to end by saying that I am very pleased because today I believe that politics has shown that when we want and when we know what the objective is we can all work together to achieve a result in the interests of our entire community Who knows that next summer in a few months moms bathers and children can have a little more peace in enjoying our wonderful sea,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,29.9248,-31.445688,31,balboni fdi mr president ladies gentlemen allow first thank president ostellari rapporteur senator

#LunesuMichelina,Mr President ladies and gentlemen this measure approved by the Council of Ministers contains urgent measures to eradicate the spread of African swine fever Eradicating the plague in wild boars and preventing infection in farmed pigs is an important intervention for the protection of the national pig population and of the entire chain It should be pointed out that in Sardinia PSA was practically eradicated and belongs to genotype 1 The PSA arrived in Piedmont Emilia Romagna and Liguria is of genotype 2 and if it were to expand it would be really dangerous for the mega pigsty of the Po Valley Those of Sardinia and the other regions are two distinct situations but Sardinia can be an example to understand the initial mistakes There were more or less sporadic cases which for some decades were not worthy of special health care perhaps because the virus did not cause damage to human health The main consequences of this were the economic consequences for farmers and cold cuts especially for the European Union 's blockade of exports of products from the entire Sardinian pig sector In a few years a pillar of the Sardinian economy had been destroyed But what were the actions of the then regional administration which for long years had been limited to selective killing in herds affected by the virus As we all know the major problem and anti-popular solution was the widespread practice of wild grazing of pigs in the vast state estates of Supramonte and Gennargentu The free pasture of pigs in continuous contact with wild boars a very erratic species was the main cause of the spread of the disease leading the administration to the establishment of a project unit for the eradication of PSA formed by health representatives FoReSTAS agriculture and environment The regional government thus begins with the adoption of an extraordinary action plan to combat the disease for the years 2015 2017 the plan subsequently approved by the European Commission for its co-financing It is precisely thanks to the continuous checks that last month in the territory of Urzulei in Sardinia forty pigs were killed as they were not registered to the zootechnic registry and without owners and health checks These activities are part of the action to combat the PSA virus which sees the illegal breeding of pigs as one of the most important risk factors for the continuation of the virus in those territories As the European Commissioners pointed out after the mission in 2021 these unregistered pigs constitute the real transmission belt of the virus between the wild population and domestic animals But the measures taken as soon as they were taken have resulted in a total commitment of the entire regional veterinary structure and of the hundreds of wild boar hunters companies which have made a decisive contribution limiting the number of wild animals and providing the findings necessary to assess the spread of the disease In summary the plans provide for the division of the municipalities into red and white hunting areas with requirements concessions and various prohibitions in relation to the cases of PSA possibly certified by the analysis of the findings The teams operating in the red zones had to equip themselves with an onerous aseptic pit for the destruction of the bowels and residues of the slaughter of wild boars and the appreciation of the meat cannot take place without the certified negativity after delivery of the results of the analysis of the findings Yes positive results in a few years PSA in Sardinia has almost completely disappeared The plan of the project unit is continuing with the result that most of the municipalities on the island has become white We therefore look forward with confidence to the European Commission s report which visited the PSA health monitoring chain last November on the basis of their response we can finally call for the end of the pigmeat embargo for Sardinia and for export to be released The current measure will prevent the regions affected from this exhausting ordeal which we have experienced So let us hope that the experience that Sardinia has experienced will contribute in some way to avoiding the mistakes made in the past and that the urgent measures taken by the Government with the suggestions and amendments tabled in the Commissions and arrived in this House can put an end to the spread of this terrible virus,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,24.212135,-22.5799,31,mr president ladies gentlemen measure approved

#BriziarelliLuca,"BRIZIERELLI L- SP PSd Az Mr President I am speaking about an area of exotic animals which has thousands of farms and tens of thousands of workers and which could cease to exist on 8 May because of Parliament 's error To be clear we are not talking about tigers pandas and all those animals that are guaranteed and protected by the Washington Convention which Italy signed in 1975 but about fish aquariums parrots and canaries which for the most part are not even imported but bred by very Italian companies which risk being outlawed by us This is not for a European regulation but for a rule that we impose on ourselves and that no other European country has adopted and that concerns import marketing and conservation To give some figures only the Italian Federation of Orniculturists counts 20,000 breeders who in the last year have ringed 1.7 million specimens of which a third exotic There is a national association that collects Italian companies that breed parrots we speak of 160 companies and 20,000 specimens but it concerns for example specialized veterinarians and doctors who adopt and use parrots in the management of selective mutism of children All of this unfortunately could be outlawed For a year now we have been trying as a League to replace the specific ban that we have delegated to the Government by regulation We are absolutely in favour of greater health controls and of the quality of life of animals this is not in question however we do not understand why millions of Italians who have as an animal of affection an exotic specimen must be placed on a different plane from those who may have a dog or a cat with a damage of billions This is only because of the ideological approach of a part of environmentalists who are at risk of not protecting the environment of not favouring animals which could even be dispersed in habitats that are not their own even more accustomed and with the risk of haunting them and instead of favouring the zoomafias and illegal imports against which for example Legambiente is fighting What we are asking for given that the delegation expires on 8 May and that this issue should be dealt with in the next Council of Ministers is that every political force of those that had already spoken last year introduces yes a regulation but not a ban The appeal to the government therefore since there are a few days left is to correct our mistake and there is an amendment in this sense presented by the League also to the current delegation law because it is okay to protect but not destroy the economy without protecting the environment and animals",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,24.578451,-25.807365,31,"brizierelli l- sp psd az mr president speaking area exotic animals thousands farms tens thousands workers could cease exist 8 may parliament 's error clear talking tigers pandas animals guaranteed protected washington convention italy signed 1975 fish aquariums parrots canaries part even imported bred italian companies risk outlawed us european regulation rule impose european country adopted concerns import marketing conservation give figures italian federation orniculturists counts 20,000 breeders last year ringed 1.7 million specimens third exotic national association collects italian companies breed parrots speak 160 companies 20,000 specimens concerns example specialized veterinarians doctors adopt use parrots management selective mutism children unfortunately could outlawed year trying league replace specific ban delegated government regulation absolutely favour greater health controls quality life animals question however understand millions italians animal affection exotic specimen must placed different plane may dog cat damage billions ideological approach part environmentalists risk protecting environment favouring animals could even dispersed habitats even accustomed risk haunting instead favouring zoomafias illegal imports example legambiente fighting asking given delegation expires 8 may issue dealt next council ministers every political force already spoken last year introduces yes regulation ban appeal government therefore since days left correct mistake amendment sense presented league also current delegation law okay protect destroy economy without protecting environment animals"
#VallardiGianpaolo,"VALLARDI L SP PSd Az Mr President I would like to thank Mr Battistoni for being here today to talk about the very important subject of bees To speak of bees I take my cue from the last reflection as supposed as I think it is said in Campania and from the reference to the famous sentence of Albert Einstein It is a phrase attributed to him even if at that time we had no more objective data But if everyone claimed that it was his sentence we strongly believe that it is The sentence is as follows after four years that the bees should hopefully never happen disappear from the face of the Earth man would also disappear This is simply because bees pollinate about 85 90 percent of all edible plant species So if there are no more bees there are no more fruits and vegetables and the man would automatically disappear from the face of the Earth From this we understand how important this topic is Today we are too busy with some very important issues such as the Covid pandemic war food self sufficiency but in my opinion we need to focus a little more and here I am addressing the whole House and not the Agriculture Commission whom I thank which adopted this motion unanimously a year ago and pay more attention to the very important subject of bees I thank the Government which last year thanks also to the solicitation of the Committee on Agriculture has allocated over 10 million euros for the 50,000 heroes that are the beekeepers of this country I say heroes because to make beekeepers you do not have a great income you have to be bee enthusiasts but above all of the environment With climate change in progress raising bees and producing honey is very difficult We had the frosts we had a very strong death of the hives so we must definitely continue to talk about bees so that this passion is passed on to future generations We must continue with the teaching of our children of the pupils talking about them in schools but above all as well as talking we must also act accordingly For this reason I would like to mention the wonderful experience I had in the Province of Treviso of which I was a promoter where a local company the Savno donated 150 hives to the schools and municipalities of the Province This allowed to touch the life of the bees but above all to create new enthusiasts who then in turn will continue to transmit such a passion This must also be absolutely borrowed in other realities given the great difficulty we have with Italian soiling i.e. with the counterfeiting of honey against those that I would like to consider invaders of our markets not only Italians but also Europeans I am referring to Chinese honey which calls honey really an aberration since inside it there are glucose fructose and only a few drops of honey and then it is sold for honey and placed safely without any kind of labelling inside our supermarkets We must continue to work in this direction we must continue to defend our products but above all our beekeepers who I repeat are real heroes of environmental protection",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,29.963524,-22.28783,31,"vallardi l sp psd az mr president would like

#VallardiGianpaolo,Mr President Government the measure on swine fever is certainly very important We discussed this intensively in the 9th and 12th Commissions I would like to take this opportunity to thank the President Parente and the two rapporteurs Senator Biti and Senator Bergesio Good work 's been done And this does not mean that it was a simple job because the theme of swine fever which I hope remains circumscribed is very serious for our country especially for the territories of Liguria and Piedmont It is a very serious and important issue on which two worlds have clashed and it has therefore served the great work of mediation of the rapporteurs and the Presidents to try to find a synthesis Two worlds have clashed the one to protect animals the animalist world and on the other hand the world of hunters both with their own reasons and positions to defend This has complicated the work in the Commission but it has been possible to sum up the measure that we are going to vote on today especially in defence of the breeding world which is a natural part of this country 's economy There is no doubt that important consideration must be given to the fact that swine fever has further highlighted the problem of wildlife and above all the damage caused by wild animals I would remind you that a year ago the 9th Commission adopted almost unanimously a resolution calling for an amendment to Law 157 of 1992 aimed at reducing damage from wild animals I believe that we absolutely must put our hands on a reform of Law 157 of 1992 because in this country we have too much damage from wild animals I speak of it as an animalist as a friend of animals but when too many animals go to destroy the work of an entire year of our farmers they are probably not so much friends of man anymore Therefore it is absolutely necessary to intervene with rationality not only for the eradication of swine fever but also to decrease the excessive number of animals returning them to their territories for example I do not believe that seeing wild boars around Rome is a great sign of civilization I do not believe that wild boars around many other cities of our country are a sign of civilization and I do not think they are even so good within those realities so we absolutely have to intervene The League has always been on these positions and as a party it is a friend of animals but it also stands in defence of the work of our farmers and we know at this particularly difficult time for our agriculture how much they need help That 's why we did this important job Today we will vote for economic aid not only to fence and eradicate swine fever but also to achieve a milestone in the initiative to revisit Law 157 of 1992 which we absolutely need,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,24.283895,-24.03986,31,mr president government measure swine fever certainly important discussed intensively 9th 12th commissions would like take opportunity thank president parente two rapporteurs senator biti senator bergesio good work 's done mean simple job theme swine fever hope remains circumscribed serious country especially territories liguria piedmont serious important issue two worlds clashed therefore served great work mediation rapporteurs presidents try find synthesis two worlds clashed one protect animals animalist world hand world hunters reasons positions defend complicated work commission possible sum measure going vote today especially defence breeding world natural part country 's economy doubt important consideration must given fact swine fever highlighted problem wildlife damage caused wild animals would remind year ago 9th commission adopted almost unanimously resolution calling amendment law 157 1992 aimed reducing damage wild animals believe absolutely must put hands reform law 157 1992 country much damage wild animals speak animalist friend animals many animals go destroy work entire year farmers probably much friends man anymore therefore absolutely necessary intervene rationality eradication swine fever also decrease excessive number animals returning territories example believe seeing wild boars around rome great sign civilization believe wild boars around many cities country sign civilization think even good within realities absolutely intervene league always positions party friend animals also stands defence work farmers know particularly difficult time agriculture much need help 's important job today vote economic aid fence eradicate swine fever also achieve milestone initiative revisit law 157 1992 absolutely need

#ZulianiCristiano,"Minister Lamorgese it is noted in the premise that Article 28 of the Decree Law of 1 March 2022 n. 17 introducing urgent measures for the containment of the costs of electricity and natural gas for the development of renewable energies for the relaunch of industrial policies the so called decree energy in conversion to the Chamber of Deputies allocates additional 905 million euros total additional compared to the 3.3 billion euros already allocated to allow the sliding of the ranking of the eligible and unfunded works of that decree of the Ministry of the Interior of 30 December 2021 relating to contributions destined to the municipalities with population over 15,000 inhabitants for investments of urban regeneration referred to in Article 1 paragraph 42 of the law 27 December 2019 n. 160 merged in the Mission 5 Inclusion and Cohesion Component 2 Social Infrastructures families community and third sector Investment 2.1 Investment in urban regeneration projects aimed at reducing marginalisation and social degradation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan This additional intervention was also necessary especially in the light of the introduction of the parameters for the division of the social and material vulnerability index IVSM whose specific weight has led to the exclusion from the ranking of numerous municipalities in the North The Law of 30 December 2021 n. 234 budget law for 2022 established in article 1 paragraph 581 a fund with a budget of 50 million euros intended for municipalities with a population of less than 5,000 inhabitants that have suffered a reduction of more than 5 percent of the population compared to 2011 that have an average income per capita of more than 3,000 euros less than the national average and that have the IVSM above the national average The implementing decree has not yet been published but in the projections developed by the National Association of Italian Municipalities ANCI it is evident that even in this case the Municipalities located in the North Regions are severely damaged by this criterion of allotment only 2.7 percent of the Municipalities of the North Regions would have access to this fund for the 0.7 of the funds allocated Given that in the awareness of the importance of support for the development of economically disadvantaged territorial areas it is also considered as important also and especially in the light of the serious economic crisis of the last two years and that from the international crisis it is assumed that it will continue for a not very short period to develop a policy of more equitable redistribution of state contributions to local authorities in order to support their development throughout the national territory The question therefore arises as to whether the Minister does not consider it appropriate to take prompt action on the definition of the criteria for allocating resources to local authorities taking seriously account of the objective of territorial cohesion while respecting a fair distribution of resources in order to avoid the repetition of situations of disparity as happened in the case of the allocation of resources

#ZulianiCristiano,Mr President the motions before us today are very important given the importance of bees for the economy and agriculture As for the economy let us always say that it is important to move towards diversification of agricultural activity Farmers and farmers have diversified agricultural activity within their farms while beekeepers small entrepreneurs support the economy of their families family members and territory It is also important from the point of view of sustainability to avoid the sterilization of the crops of our orchards Let us remember that in China where there are practically no more bees beekeepers in fact they are not in this case are forced to artificially pollinate fruit trees We avoid getting to this and keep in mind the environmental disasters that are affecting us from the frosts to the drought of this period I would like to focus in particular on the first signed motion by Senator Vallardi where in point 2 the Government is committed to supporting the implementation of projects in primary and secondary schools I thank all the beekeepers who are already committed to this and have not waited for the aid of Parliament or the Government They carry out a daily activity alongside the volunteers of the associations In my territory of the Verona plain we have the association Verbena dell Adige which daily together with the mayors seeks to raise awareness of communities pupils childhood adolescence all young people on this important topic of economy and environmental sustainability They are exemplary mayors who give the availability of spaces for the positioning of hives and hives Here we have an example Senator Pirovano who is mayor of Misano di Gera d'Adda tells us also through the posts on social media the activities he does for his community It vibrates quivers and raises awareness of its own community its own countrymen and its small citizens who are our future These mayors engage with concrete actions in activities involving the world of school or alternatively the parish world linked to the activities of grest childhood adolescence young people as we said before Among other things we remember the benefits from the point of view of health healthy and genuine products those of our Italian beekeepers because we all know the properties as well as honey also of propolis Often in winter we have consumed candy and propolis products which serve excuse the brutal term to disinfect the oropharyngeal cable or throat It is recent news during the Covid period that a research of the CREA funded by the Ministry of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policy has emerged encouraging data Far from me to say that there is a valid alternative to vaccination Covid certainly however are confirmed the beneficial properties of propolis fruit of the work of our friends bees The synthesis of the research is that the certified presence of SARS CoV 2 outside experimental hives did not result in its presence inside with the entrance of the bees in particular in honey Evidently the propolis used by bees combined with their enzyme secretions turns out to be an excellent antiviral Sometimes nature meets us with what already exists It remains for us to value it through these motions and these commitments to the Government towards our communities and the environment It is important what we will do and also important beyond the economic measures adopted by the Budget Act and the Support Decree to continue to work economically to meet the environment and health,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#ZulianiCristiano,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen I am speaking with the following statement Since 1978 since I deal with swine fever I have never found the situation as difficult as at this time the disease is present in five continents and in over 50 countries and continues to progress very quickly This was said by Professor Manuel Sanchez Vizcaino Rodriguez a World Health Organization expert and director of the reference laboratory for PSA who infects domestic and wild pigs with a high mortality rate We had the pleasure of having the professor auditioned at the Senate The greatest danger and the first transmission channel the expert has explained are represented by the export of the infected pork meat And as far as Italy is concerned it is necessary to understand how PSA arrived in order to control it and prevent it from continuing to arrive The genetic sequencing of the virus in Italy has not yet been carried out explained Professor and it is even more important to know the origin i.e. whether it came from Europe the European Union or even Asia and how whether by ship or by road This is to avoid a second infection and make a rigorous surveillance program According to the expert the only possibility we have is the control of the disease which can be carried out on the basis of three individual actions early prevention before it spreads the containment of the infected area and the reduction of the population of wild boars It is certainly important as my colleague Senator Bergesio together with Senator Biti has already said for the measures that are being implemented with this measure He also recalled how fundamental the action of the individual regions is As far as my territories of origin are concerned I would like to remind you that at the beginning of the year the regional fauna venatory plan 2022 2027 was approved thanks to the work of the Junta the Regional Council and the Councillor Corazzari which states that it is an innovative programming document attentive to environmental requirements and to the comparison with stakeholders Explains the Councillor Corazzari with delegation to hunting and fishing With this plan for the first time each with its own specific characteristics some criticalities related to the wildlife that characterize our territory wolf and large carnivores on one side and wild boar on the other On the one hand by promoting integration with other regional programmers on the other hand by promoting in an overall framework the control activities of wild boar especially which as we know can also be a source of damage to protected habitats and more recently unfortunately as an active element in the fight against the possible entry of African swine fever into our territory In recalling the important issue that we are dealing with that is the health one let us not forget the implications on the productive and economic fabric and on the breeding of pigs which represents a fundamental economy for some regions of our country We have therefore also given importance to the serious economic fallout that might occur For the same reason I would like to take this opportunity to remind you of any important negative effects that might have on the agricultural sector It is true that we are talking about the livestock and health sector but the presence of this wild animal the wild boar is already causing major damage to the agricultural sector I am now quoting an article in a periodical newspaper on agricultural products Agrarian Informant entitled More corn in the fields wild boars are content At this time when we have major production problems about the import of raw materials related to the food and agriculture world it is important to reflect on the containment of these wilds and on the reasons I have just outlined I read from the article That of Mr. Claudio Orlandi of the Castellina farm in Borgonovo Piacenza is the desperate testimony of a farmer unfortunately one of the many who will no longer sow corn because of wild boars In 2021 it had to re-seminate 23 hectares of maize of the 25 farms dedicated to the cultivation and then collect little or nothing with a damage to the cultivations we speak of a single farmer which the expert estimated to exceed 45,000 euros In the article there is also a picture of the cornfield reset by wild boars I keep quoting Orlandi conducts a dairy farm with about 320 animals 150 of which are lactating the corn of farm origin was a fundamental element of the ration From the photos taken with the drone on my fields you can see well where the wild boars ate the first time because in those areas the seedlings are lower where they are higher there are holes because they entered later and finally a third where the bare ground remained At each reseed some damage was also done with the tractor because we had to enter the field trying not to crush the already born plants A huge job with an increase in costs seeds diesel time For years we have been calling for the eradication of wild boars in hill and plain areas where the herds have become sedentary by exchanging our fields for their supermarket says Filippo Gasparini president of Confagricoltura Piacenza Now with the nightmare of swine fever at the gates the killings are suspended It is a paradoxical situation we should increase the production of maize but wild boars eat it but we can not cut it down From all this we understand the importance of this measure I would like to remind you that from other points of view too for example if we look at the ecological aspect there are repercussions for the presence of these wilds Let us remember that in mountain areas we are working to ensure that the reduction of agricultural production does not take place But in the mountainous territory unfortunately there are and there are many damages so we have to work on this The bushes of the grassy mantles of the mountain territories where hay is produced and where herbs are collected to feed cows sheep and goats that produce cheeses typical of our territories is frustrated so there is a fall on the livestock on the breeding and also on agriculture The ecological aspect is therefore important but it is not enough to go to the stage of Coldiretti at the events of City and countryside united against wild boars if then there is no action that meets the world of breeding Let us also remember that an emergency is already in place and concerns the world of agriculture I therefore call on all my fellow Members to reflect on the need to work on this too",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,24.100279,-22.59386,31,"mr president ladies gentlemen speaking following statement since 1978 since deal swine fever never found situation

#DeCarloLuca,DE CARLO FdI Mr President I am obliged first of all to clarify from the point of view of the method the resolution to which Mr La Pietra referred earlier voted by the whole Commission but never arrived in this House the resolution on bees It is a pair with that on wildlife which with as much laziness this House has forgotten to treat so much so that we continue to see boars spinning rocketing for this city often closing also the cycle of waste in the sense that what the municipal administrations of Rome should do in this city wild boars do brilliantly And we saw them in their last apparition even on the beach of San Felice al Circeo where rightly after many months of work in winter autumn and spring autumn in the context of the cycle of waste they rightly allow themselves their vacation so much so that we have seen a video where they even stand above the deckchairs The inertia in dealing with this theme therefore has led this city to be almost a joke from the point of view of the wild boar 's life We would not however want the same thing to happen with bees Mr President who sees us from outside could say what are you doing With all the problems we have today do you worry and talk about insects as apparently insignificant as bees In fact the bee is doing exactly what we should do in the agri food field today Thanks to bees in fact today there are productions pollination and therefore the greater production which is what we need today In the very short period we will have to feed a constantly growing world population and we cannot do so regardless of the existence of pollinating animals So it 's no accident that we 're dealing with this issue The bee is somewhat opposed to the policies that the European Union would like to put in place namely those of the farm to fork which aim to reduce the production of the planet The bee on the other hand does exactly the opposite for thousands of years it has contributed to increasing production And that is the only reason why we should discuss the subject today take the philosophy of the bee and contrast it with the philosophy of the living room ecologists who do not care about the production because so much they will probably be destined to eat synthetic foods Since we do not give up on this we are deliberately and selfishly on the side of the bee As if that were not enough the bee is also the symbol of a sustainable world Colleagues it was 2008 when my colleague Balboni he reminded me earlier already put at the centre of the political agenda with a question the problem of the bees and the sustainability of the environment for the life of the bee as a testimony of how not only he was the avant garde ecologist but already this movement that always attentive to these issues poses questions and solutions other than demagogy but much closer to the practicality that we should all have As my colleague La Pietra has said as an agricultural sector we have already intended to fulfill many commitments that have been included in our motion today making sure that every municipal council every institution or institution can legitimately decide in favour of a greater sensitivity to the topic of bees through resolutions that we have prepared and made to vote by many municipalities I am talking about those of Veneto that have been really many and some avant garde municipalities like San Pietro Mussolino with the mayor Tasso has even placed the bees at the center of a project of revitalization itself of the municipality through a whole series of themes of bee interest that make that an important town But it 's not just that We believe that through the bees we will save this planet and we will do so in the simplest way that of the conservatives that is trying to preserve what our fathers have left us to deliver to our children a better world,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,28.871742,-22.37426,31,de carlo fdi mr president obliged first clarify point view

#DeCarloLuca,"IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen Mr La Pietra first took a rather ruthless picture of the management or non-management of wildlife in this country It is a vision still heavily conditioned by ideology by a very little knowledge of the balance between wild and domestic and above all perhaps conditioned by a vision now too urbanized of rural Italy If until thirty years ago 70 percent of the Italian population lived in rural areas and therefore knew the mechanisms and the life of Italian rurality while only 30 percent lived in urbanized areas we are now moving towards a society in which in a matter of very few years the percentage of fact is reversed We will have over 70 percent of people living in cities and 30 percent in rural areas I leave out all the considerations here concerning those who will maintain and maintain those rural areas in case they become depopulated On this I believe that there are other instruments with which we must intervene and on which we must work That 's because I do n't give up on this urban centric vision On the other hand I believe that the city is functional when it can rest on a rural hinterland which allows it to feed itself and still have control of atmospheric agents so that they do not condition it as happened with the floods of certain rivers even in Veneto with respect to environmental safety But this is another game I would rather focus on the anti-rural and anti-agricultural vision of a certain part of this Parliament as well If anyone can be happy and happy to see wild boar mom feeding wild boars in the center of Rome I on the other hand consider this a failure not only of the policies of containment of the wild but also of the policies of urban management because it is not normal to see a wild animal living in the urban area That is a twist of this nation not a serious plan to contain wildlife for the benefit not only as in this case of the pig raised and therefore the possibility of contracting a disease which appears in Europe in 2014 therefore there has been some time to study containment mechanisms The European Union finances a project of more than € 10 million for vaccine research We are very fast quite rightly to find a vaccine for the Covid 19 but we are at a time when we should act to contain diseases that weigh heavily on national GDP In fact at this moment even our pig chain is heavily conditioned by some possible speculation at the center of the chain itself which leads farmers to be recognized an increase of a few cents and other contractors such as slaughterhouses see increased expenditure on the chain of processors and sausages by more than 28 40 percent We must be able to ensure that farmers incomes are stable under normal conditions which is also heavily influenced by the increase in the cost of feed The data of the Agricultural Research Council and the analysis of the agricultural economy Crea photograph a situation according to which one farm in four pig and cereal sectors will not be able in the next campaign to buy the inputs to make the production cycle This means that 27,000 companies are at risk We must start from this assumption even when we deal with health and issues such as swine fever which today can only refer to a geographical area but which certainly have a very wide reflection on the national market Some nations Mr La Pietra has rightly mentioned have already closed the import of processed products from Italy today penalising the market We all know and we all know that in Europe there is a certain behavior on the part of some sovereign nation Today the term sovereignism in the sense of having a national interest has returned to fashion quoted by Macron and not by Giorgia Meloni Luca De Carlo or Patrizio La Pietra Those nations today have all the interest in seeing erodes a slice of the market today the prerogative of the Italians to replace it with slices of the internal market I think of France and Germany who enjoy seeing us bogged down in bureaucracy also with reference to issues such as swine fever which should unite us and above all make us ring a bell of alarm with respect to some vision I do not say old fashioned because no one a few years ago would have dreamed of seeing wild boars in the center of Rome but that is now spoiled by a kind of widespread Heidi syndrome according to which the goats make you hello while the pig farmers are great polluters and murderers Let 's clear the field from all these cartoon visions because that 's not the case The reality is quite different and the majority in Europe has also noticed it which a few weeks ago had voted on rules such as that of the Farm to Fork or set aside which predicted the reduction of production with the chimera of climate change which objectively exists We must therefore rethink our agricultural policies and thinking about agricultural policies is already a step forward In fact so far little has been thought about and zero planned unless someone gets up in this House to say that they have a serious strategic plan based on concrete things that will be illustrated today I 'd love to see it and also discuss it To date however we have seen a counter order comrades of Guareschi's memory according to which what was voted yesterday by the majority in Europe that is the Farm to Fork is not good today Greater areas are being asked to be cultivated All perfect but you do n't fool someone who 's suspended by a year means having land available with the same yield as those who have been working for maybe ten years Otherwise it means understanding little or nothing of agriculture It 's okay to suspend it and even extend it for as long as possible We are talking about an agriculture the Italian one which is objectively one of the most sustainable in Europe After that we can improve We too can improve legislation since sometimes we do so in short circuit with what we did last week We must however start with two assumptions The first is that we must feed a growing world population the second is that we must guarantee our farmers a safe and secure income In fact there can be no income security systems only for adverse events and there is no guarantee to producers of the changed or changed effects of the market It is not possible today and we must work on this 10:55 a.m. Followed by De Carlo But we have to do this by taking up this vision that the farmer is the big polluter and the one with the trendy boots who lives in the city all week and goes to the mountains once a week is the real environmentalist You were wrong The true environmentalist the one who preserves the environment forever is the farmer The figures tell us our farmers have reduced the use of pesticides by 20 while France and Germany which today teach us have increased it We have an emission of 30 million tons of CO2 compared to more than 60 million in Germany and 76 million in France the same countries that today come to dictate the rules and expect to teach us what sustainability is We have companies that have invested there are reports the last of which is the one that came out of Confagricoltura which mentions how many companies and how many investments on innovation made by our companies Unfortunately we have very bad water management but it must be improved because the other nations yes have done better than us We have 11 percent of water held in our rainwater basins while the other nations have reached almost 50 percent So let 's question ourselves and copy from the great nations but let 's put Italian sustainable agriculture at the centre even when we do these measures otherwise we lose focus and go to beat those who made sustainability until yesterday like pig

#LaPietraPatrizioGiacomo,Mr President I will probably take even less minutes than I have been given because there are not so many things to say Finally we are bringing an extremely interesting subject to the House Beekeeping is an economic sector not very important compared to the whole Italian agri -food system There is talk at European level of a few billion as regards trade in this product as we know the main product is honey but derived from this there are also many other products and by products that serve not only for food but also for other sectors such as cosmetics Beyond the aspect of beekeeping it is important to bring a topic to the House today to be put to the public 's attention and I do not think it escapes my colleagues who are here now and who speaking of bees are filling this room with a pleasant buzz because they are not careful the fact that this small insect along with many other pollinating insects is the driving force behind agriculture Through these insects in fact we manage to have agricultural production Five motions were presented starting from one signed by colleagues of the League and presented in May 2021 We as the Brothers of Italy Group have also tabled a motion which is highlighted in relation to the others on a number of points that I would like to stress The first of all is that which calls on the government to commit itself to reducing the VAT rate from 22 to 10 for beekeeping equipment It is a sector that as I said before has a low economic impact but that still requires important investments to those who want to devote to this activity and income as well as in many other sectors is certainly not profitable The second point is important we expect real and concrete compensation with regard to income support even in cases of damage to production caused by climate change which very often lead to zeroing these farms so much so that if until recently the bees in some way gave a nourishment or maintenance to man very often because of climate change it is man himself who must feed these animals who are at risk of extinction Of course even here the problem is not only climate change but sometimes also the indiscriminate use of certain pesticides which do not help the survival of these insects In this case too we try to urge important commitments such as education within schools but above all to encourage the actions of the Municipalities so much so that with the agricultural department of Brothers of Italy directed by my colleague De Carlo in recent months we have made a motion in all the Municipalities in which this problem was highlighted trying to urge them to take action to defend these animals This is what is basically proposed in the motions We could then talk about unfair competition especially from China which creates products with syrup But what I wanted to highlight and stigmatize Mr President is that unfortunately we have missed an opportunity in the Committee on Agriculture Last Friday I urged the Commission because beyond the motions it had made an act of direction a business assigned by the Presidency which we all voted together The whole of the Agriculture Commission had voted on the document I am sorry that Senator Taricco whom I highly esteem has proposed as a single motion of the PD exactly and literally with a copy and paste all the document that we had unanimously approved and that was the result of the work of all the Commissioners and all the political groups It is certainly a behavior to be stigmatized because it is incorrect Also because I had this thing publicly,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,29.922155,-22.240112,31,mr president probably take even less minutes given many things say finally bringing extremely interesting subject

#LaPietraPatrizioGiacomo,Mr President a lot has already been said I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their speeches and for the work they have done in the Commission which certainly tried to sew the various sensitivities which as President Vallardi also said emerged during the debate As Senator Biti said the farmers asked us to intervene immediately I would like to make a comment on this because from the first report about the presence of African swine fever in an animal found dead at the enactment of the decree law that we are discussing today it has been two months from that 17 February it has passed another month in three months therefore we have only succeeded I say it not to make controversy but because it must be the object of reflection to activate the bureaucracy and it has been done the simplest thing that is to say to establish to do nothing everything has been blocked all the hunting activities all the play and work activities in the woods I say this Mr President because there is very likely something to be reviewed throughout the legislative system which regulates the hunting aspects in Italy It seems to me that Mr Vallardi and Mr Bergesio have also referred to this I 'd like to make a simple note Many documents have already been presented in the direction of amending Italian legislation on the containment of wildlife One in particular is a report that the Agriculture Commission voted unanimously only four were abstention votes but all the others were positive This report which concerned a deal on wildlife damage was voted on on 30 June last year Mr President allow me to make these remarks That report referred to many species of animals which are in fact a damage to agriculture but in particular the wild boar The wild boar is spoken of as a particularly overcrowded and overestimated species There is an excessive amount of animals compared to the sustainability of the territory which poses many problems I briefly leave the problem of road safety aside because most of the accidents that occur and unfortunately victims are also caused by these people I leave aside the damage to agriculture the destruction of crops That is what was said in that report These are a few lines which I would like to read to remind myself but also to the House Among the implications that make it necessary and urgent to intervene on the excessive proliferation of the species are the health risks that the excessive spread of the boar can exert towards the livestock sector The disproportionate number of wild boars exponentially increases the risk of introduction of certain diseases such as African swine fever PSA which can create important health risks for the subsequent spread of pathogens and then continues We had written this and approved it in the Commission on 30 June last year Mr President I should also like to say to my fellow senators perhaps a little distracted that there were about twenty points in that report which gave clear indications to the government on how to try to combat the spread Let me mention a few to establish a sustainable control plan for the wild boar species to rethink the approach to the management of wild boar in the territory aiming at effective prevention to activate in order to enact effective rules that fill legislative gaps to amend Law No 157 of 1992 Mr President I am saying all this because when dealing with situations in a demagogic way then instead of preventing them we are forced to deal with emergencies as we are now We have repeatedly requested at the meeting of the Leaders in the Commission that we be able to bring this document to the House but we have always found obstructionism particularly on the part of some forces that face the problem in a demagogic way I am referring to the Mixed Group and Senator De Petris who have always opposed bringing the measure to the House for her debate I also wonder who Senator De Petris represents because within the Mixed Group there are completely different positions on the subject I am thinking for example of Senators Abbot and Fattori who have signed and signed this document yet their Leader in the Commission has always opposed it Here too therefore there is a matter to be clarified In the same way I say very clearly that the same Movimento 5 Stars had opposed the discussion of the document Even the Democratic Party has not had a very strong attitude from time to time indeed it was very lukewarm I say this because if this measure had passed through this House and had been able to debate it and approve it surely with some changes perhaps we would have dealt with this situation differently today The other day in the Health Commission at the end of the sitting the President of the Commission asked me why the regions despite the decree have not yet implemented any prevention plan It is simple the regulatory system is confused and does not allow institutions to operate Mr President I believe that in this House there is certainly a strong political responsibility for some forces at this moment in the majority which with their pre-emptive environmentalist and animalist attitude are questioning the whole livestock supply chain which corresponds to 1.5 points of national GDP for livestock only If we expand the debate on food processing and food processing we are talking about tens of thousands of jobs and billions of economies that we might see blurred Even today only on the news that there is African swine fever in Italy fortunately for now in that restricted area many foreign nations have blocked imports from Italy This is what we are talking about and not about boars who are seen walking through the streets of Rome or other cities We need to take action on this As to the merits of the provision the decree was born deflated The Commissioner was only a coordinator and had no means powers and resources to put in place decisive timely and fast action I appreciate the work done by our rapporteurs because in some way some resources have finally arrived but we are talking about EUR 10 million We are investing EUR 10 million in a supply chain worth billions More attention had to be paid to the fact that 10 million euros even if well come because as they say old husband better than nothing are too few You have to have the conscience to invest Now we want to make fences but how long will it take to make it 260 kilometers In these weeks the wild boar population will certainly become five or six times higher than the present one and therefore at that point there will be further pressure to the outside You have to be aware of what you do If we do not take strong and targeted actions for immediate eradication within the red zone trying to reduce the amount of those grits which are around not only the red zone but throughout Italy it is proved that the large number of wild boars brings in fact this disease we will not be able to solve the problem I repeat that when we face such problems we must do it with our feet on the ground in a concrete way and not with the ideological forms that very often unfortunately so many movements of the majority are adopting,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,24.273947,-24.446611,31,mr president lot already said would like thank rapporteurs speeches work done commission certainly tried sew various

#BergesioGiorgioMaria,"Bergesio L SP PSd Az Mr President organic farming is a very important issue for our country but I would like to mention the numbers of our agriculture which is worth almost 32 billion euros Italy is the first country at European level if we think that French agriculture is worth 30 billion and Spanish agriculture is worth 29 billion Organic is worth 3.5 billion euros and biodynamics is worth 200 million euros It is important to legislate on all issues as the rapporteur said earlier but it is also essential to understand the size of the area of interest of the measure The bill is important and fits into a context of great difficulty for Italian agriculture I would say that today is also a moment of great celebration for the inauguration of the agricultural fair in Verona an extraordinary event at international level where there will certainly be some equipment there will be moments of information and communication about especially organic farming I believe however that the value we give to this measure which is of great importance to more than 70,000 companies is substantial although these days it is already said that we are close to 80,000 individual companies at national level that are carrying out this activity They are young people who in a continuous growing are looking for a precise agriculture but above all give the opportunity to produce genuine food In the defence of this agriculture we are also looking for the protection of the health of the consumer which is fundamental Over the last decade sales of organic products have grown by more than 122 percent an important figure the success of consumption supports the increase in production in our country as has been said before by colleagues We are the first European producers and we are the second in the world but with a product control capacity that only Italy has at European and global level We must recognise this to our agriculture sector but above all we must recognise it to our producers who are struggling and also living a bureaucratic practice which through this measure we will try to simplify not in order to make sure that controls and checks are abandoned but in order to make it more immediate and faster from the computer point of view In this context of the industry 's full ferment the draft law under consideration is inserted which can therefore make an important contribution to the whole of our world Among the most qualifying points I would like to remind you the measure provides for the introduction of a brand for Italian bio in order to mark as 100 percent made in Italy only organic products obtained from national raw material In fact there is and we must also say this in relation to Italian soiling and to all the counterfeits of the Italian product in the world a real alarm for the invasion of products from non-EU countries with an increase in the quantity of product by more than 10 per year and with about one third of products from Asia where there is a very high control difficulty as we were able to verify in the hearings held in the Committee on Agriculture The brand is also an important tool for strengthening the presence of national products on foreign markets Much has been done by the Ministry of Agriculture for the dissemination and support of these products I would like to thank the Undersecretary Battistoni for his commitment to the promotion of supply chains which is very important We also look very carefully at innovation especially in the youth world In fact the bill provides for the possibility of creating digital platforms to ensure full information about the origin quality and traceability of products with a delegation to the Government and here the activity of our Ministers and our Subsecretaries returns to the field to review the legislation on controls and guarantee the autonomy of certification bodies Important elements are introduced in the law also for the definition and recognition of biodistricts as well as introducing in our system the forms of representation properly recognized and valued which was missing today innovative for the biological as up to now provided only for other specific sectors Our wish is to contribute to sustaining with this law a larger system that of national agro -food for which new development prospects can be opened up making it appealing to the younger generations and ensuring that there is a profitability that today is severely put into crisis in our agriculture by many factors by the very serious and uncontrolled increase of energy costs and by the increase of raw materials other fundamental aspect If anyone paid attention yesterday he would have noticed that cereal lists have marked frightening increases per tonne of product as far as national production is concerned On the other hand we have the problem of African swine fever which has not been eradicated at all on the contrary we are in the process of discussing this measure There is also the problem of avian influenza which involves large territories of our country Finally there is the very serious situation of the war which also involves a blockade of exports to those countries whose purchases up to now have implemented the production phase very much For all these reasons President we as Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione will vote in favour of the measure and we hope that in the meantime we will be able to give strength and energy to the other measures to help the Italian agricultural and agri -food sector always in the vision of a consumer attentive

#BergesioGiorgioMaria,"Mr President I too would like to thank all those who have committed themselves to this measure as well as the members of the Government who have been very carefully present in the Commission The measure to our examination is very important and is born not against someone but to give a hand and help a relevant chain of our country that of pig farming both in the phase of production and of transformation that has received very heavy shocks in the last months with a dry loss per week of over 25 million euros It is a real loss especially because African swine fever has entered a complicated environment and in an area where pig production is very demanding and numerous such as that of the Piedmont Region where over 3,500 companies operate in the sector with a million and three hundred thousand heads out of eight million products in our country On the other hand this chain is part of an Italian context in which we have a total of about 25,000 companies working in the livestock production sector and over 3,500 in the processing sector All this makes us think and it has made us think from the outset that it was important to give the necessary powers to try to eradicate this is the exact term on this front African swine fever just as other countries of the European Union have done such as Belgium which was able to intervene in a very short time The measure basically recalls three principles the first concerns the regions which must draw up be approved and have plans for the eradication of swine fever and for the containment of wildlife The second principle is the role of the Commissioner with his powers and resources available On this point the Commissions and the Government have worked well because in the end we have succeeded by tabling some amendments about fifteen in total to make the measure a turning point making it concrete and feasible especially because I am talking about Decree Law No 9 without resources and in such a context it was impossible for the Commissioner to operate Thanks to the intervention of the Minister of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policies Patuanelli as well as of the other ministries that shared the commitment 10 million euros were allocated resources taken from what was included in the decree support-b the 50 million euros measure 15 of which serve companies and enterprises to implement the biosafety principles also recalled by this decree On the other hand we felt it would be useful to resume from the remaining EUR 35 million for the processing sector EUR 10 million to use them immediately in this context because the Commissioner cannot act if he does not have the resources available This means it is a commitment of the Minister a commitment of ours and a commitment of the Government that these resources must be refilled and restored as soon as possible we have also presented an agenda on this matter so that it is ensured that in the first useful measure they must be restored in the correct context which is that of the pig supply chain which is suffering very serious losses In amending the measure we have also succeeded in giving the Commissioner clear powers as to how to act in its immediate day to day operation The issue of fences which my colleague Mrs Biti spoke about well before was also very important but we cannot only talk about fences or containment methods if we cannot then implement them because of urbanistic problems landscapes cultural heritage and everything that our country faces when we have something to do and it is unfortunately discovered that simplification exists only verbally and not substantially Here too we have managed to establish a rule with deadlines to be met but they are very fast if there is no response in twenty days there is progress especially on the issue of the public benefit that is given full mandate to the Commissioner For this reason I believe that the measure under consideration has taken up a number of important articles also on the topic of biosafety on which will be presented an implementing decree on which I invite the government to indicate clear measures asking that indications be given at national level especially to the farms and the breeders so that they can act in accordance with a system that makes it possible to preserve the breeding from external insertions I am thinking for example of the demarcation closure of all accesses of the revenue of the means of the personnel and fundamental of the material within the farm I am still thinking of the protection of sheds the management of dead animals the entry of all types of loads and also and above all the biosafety of those who enter those who work and those who work at the health level in the area of controls management and prevention Therefore it is necessary to ensure that this is a measure that guides our country especially because in sectors such as poultry important progress has already been made while on pig farming there is still some difficulty I think however there are conditions for doing well We considered it useful as I said before to present the agenda mentioned I appeal to the Government so that in the next measures it is possible to amend and directly perhaps with decree law to return the resources to the sector which as already noted is suffering We now have countries around the world asking for certifications that should not be required because pig meat or processed meat ham and cold cuts must come from areas or areas free from African swine fever This is absolutely not conceivable because we know that in the infected area there are two farms and in it the animals are killed There is therefore no problem from this point of view and above all we must act immediately to contain the situation Hence also the passage with the Regions that must act I would remind you that many of them have not yet transmitted plans for the eradication of swine fever and above all prevention Also those Regions must be operational because it is essential that from the point of view of the control of the Ministry of Health but also of the Higher Institute for Environmental Protection and Research ISPRA and of all those called to make important checks there is awareness of what is happening throughout the country We are here today to listen to the speeches that will take place during the general debate but above all to say that perhaps it is not the best possible measure that could be taken but we have all changed it together making it immediately feasible There is no doubt that other important measures will be possible in the forthcoming measures Someone asked us about the resources for all those sectors that are in crisis in spite of pig farming on the territory we also talk about those who carry out tourism activities of receiving tourists of those who operate on the territory in many ways However this has not been possible in the measure before us As it was not possible to amend Law No 157 of 1992 as requested by several parties with knowledge of the facts since no one has invented anything I call for this aspect which our Group has always advocated to be taken into account It is essential that the 30 year old rule should be amended These are not only wildlife damage but also damage to the cultivation and safety of cities Huge problems in our country must be tackled at the level of agricultural production also and above all on the containment of wildlife",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#BergesioGiorgioMaria,"Mr President I would like to thank all those who have spoken in general debate so far I would remind everyone that this measure issued on 17 February 2022 involved four Ministries in expressing their assessments in the Commission the Ministry of Sustainable Infrastructure and Mobility the Ministry of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policies the Ministry of Economics and Finance and the Ministry of Health The measure has been examined by two committees the Agriculture Commission and the Health and Health Commission and I believe that the work has been done in a short time I also say this to my friend Senator La Pietra In forty three days we brought the measure to the Chamber after having audited about twenty subjects in total there were 45 organisations and associations that had asked to be audited We have taken back everyone 's contributions very carefully This is a sensitive issue and I believe that this decree law will be schooled in future measures both as regards African swine fever and avian influenza I thank Senator Vallardi who mentioned a motion for a resolution that we have ready to bring to the House the containment of wildlife in our country is an important issue also raised by Senator La Pietra Senator Lunesu has told us about the experience she has experienced in Sardinia in order to treasure it We note this and have also taken note of it before in the Commission Senator Zuliani has invited us not to take more walkways on stages of large organizations such as Coldiretti Confagricoltura CIA union organizations but to proceed with measures that are able to solve the problem Senator Fregolent reminded us of the damage to the supply chain inviting us to act immediately As we have said before it is over 20 million euros a week that the supply chain is undergoing a crazy collapse between sales and production prices On the other hand there are costs which are not only the costs of African swine fever but they are the costs of raw materials they are the energy costs they are also and above all the costs of work combined with all the other economic factors that today weigh on the breeding the agricultural productions the 25,000 companies that in our country produce pigs Senator De Carlo spoke of a vision too urbanized of a rural Italy It is true I agree with him this is an important issue But on the other hand the issue of vaccines must also be seen on this issue if possible as well as on the issue of avian influenza which is another scourge of our country We also listened to Senator Boldrini who spoke about this sharing It is true that we wanted to give the Commissioner even more power not to put the regions in the background but to make them work in coordination Finally I believe that a good text has come out because the Commissioner will be able to work in close coordination with the economic resources we have given ourselves Senator De Bonis reminded us that positions must not be outrageous It is true because if we had started from the concept I say also to Senator Crucioli that this measure would have had to solve all the problems related to breeding agriculture wildlife the lack of collection of tourism the costs of managing the local authorities a sort of omnibus measure we would not have succeeded in doing so There will be other measures that will be able to solve these problems Senator Cantù spoke to us about the reform of veterinary public health a subject which I believe should be put on the agenda of this House You know that veterinarians in other countries of Europe depend not on the Ministry of Health but on the Ministry of Agriculture I believe that a reflection must be made on this issue above all starting from the concept of relationship and above all from the type of professional relationship between the veterinarian the breeder and all public health which is very dear to this country We have also listened to our Leader in the Committee on Agriculture whom I thank Senator Naturale to talk about a shared path that has been important We have done everything we can and I also thank the Budget Commission Mr Pesco and the Commissioners for the work they have done They have succeeded both in a proposal for an important amendment that we will see later Amendment 2.4 and Amendments 1.60 and 1.61 to take them back at the last session of the Budget Committee allowing us to clarify a point that was particularly dear to Senator Bruzzone but also to other senators I am talking about the identification not only of the provincial guards but also in some regions such as Liguria where the provincial guards no longer exist of the regional guards In the end with the term local police as the Undersecretary has explained we have resumed

#BergesioGiorgioMaria,Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would just like to mention two basic passages The measure started from the Senate thanks to the initiative of the members of the Agriculture and Food Production Commission and on all President Vallardi This is an important bill in view of the great crisis that the agriculture sector is experiencing because of the increase in raw materials energy costs and the difficulties associated with the lack of matching of rising prices of products for sale The initiative is placed in a general framework where the risk of supply connected with the international crisis gives the possibility to enhance the role of our productions Already since 2020 there has been a growth compared to previous years of more than 7 of Italian family companies and companies that have decided to invest in direct sales which in our country is worth over 6 billion euros I have concluded and I ask that I be able to deliver the written text of my speech,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,32.412132,-20.145815,31,mr president ladies gentlemen would like mention two basic passages measure started senate thanks initiative members agriculture food production commission president vallardi important bill view great crisis agriculture sector experiencing increase raw materials energy costs difficulties associated lack matching rising prices products sale initiative placed general framework risk supply connected international crisis gives possibility enhance role productions already since 2020 growth compared previous years 7 italian family companies companies decided invest direct sales country worth 6 billion euros concluded ask able deliver written text speech
#BergesioGiorgioMaria,Mr President the measure before us comes to the House after a particularly complicated and difficult period such as lockdown which has changed the consumption habits of Italians in particular by strengthening their sensitivity to the issues of health and safety the origin and sustainability of food purchased Today in fact statistics show that in recent months Italians have made much healthier choices moving towards higher quality and safer foods both in terms of origin and production methods In fact I would like to point out that this measure is different from the previous one which dealt with small local productions for sale This is the sale to zero kilometer or to useful kilometer so we speak of 70 kilometers from the place of production or in any case of transformation Direct sales especially close to zero kilometer have become choices by consumers 22 percent of consumers say they have increased their purchases of these categories 28 percent have started to buy food from short supply chains just during the Covid 19 period and we hope they will continue in the post Covid 19 period Zero kilometre foodstuffs shall mean those agricultural and livestock products including aquaculture and products from places of production and processing of raw material or raw materials at a distance not exceeding 70 kilometres radius from the place of sale or in any case from the same Province of the place of sale or from the place of consumption of the catering service as well as fresh sea fishing and inland fishing products from landing points at a distance not exceeding 70 kilometres radius from the place of sale We also have an important initiative which is that of valorization through trademarks of production and distinction On this the Ministry will probably have to implement a policy of organization and harmonization in order to coordinate a system of all the brands that start from organic that we have approved the past weeks zero kilometer small local productions and all the others This is in order to succeed in having a clear picture always in defense of both the small producer and the final consumer who wants to buy these products Mr President I would like to add the full text of my report to the Minutes of today 's sitting,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,33.664734,-21.06737,31,mr president measure us comes house particularly complicated difficult period lockdown changed consumption habits italians particular strengthening sensitivity issues health safety origin sustainability food purchased today fact statistics show recent months italians made much healthier choices moving towards higher quality safer foods terms origin production methods fact would like point measure different previous one dealt small local productions sale sale zero kilometer useful kilometer speak 70 kilometers place production case transformation direct sales especially close zero kilometer become choices consumers 22 percent consumers say increased purchases categories 28 percent started buy food short supply chains covid 19 period hope continue post covid 19 period zero kilometre foodstuffs shall mean agricultural livestock products including aquaculture products places production processing raw material raw materials distance exceeding 70 kilometres radius place sale case province place sale place consumption catering service well fresh sea fishing inland fishing products landing points distance exceeding 70 kilometres radius place sale also important initiative valorization trademarks production distinction ministry probably implement policy organization harmonization order coordinate system brands start organic approved past weeks zero kilometer small local productions others order succeed clear picture always defense small producer final consumer wants buy products mr president would like add full text report minutes today 's sitting
#PillonSimone,Mr President I would like to say a few words about Amendment 1.2 which seeks to replace wherever it is reported the expression watercraft with the expression native boat or ship This is because referring exclusively to recreational craft commercial units would be excluded and there would be an unjustified exemption from the penalty With the generic definition of natantante which as we know is the unit up to 10 meters of boat which as we know is the unit from 10 to 24 meters and ship which is the legal definition of unit over 24 meters we have embraced everything that is to be considered naval unit whether commercial or recreational,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,30.276339,-29.8621,31,mr president would like say words amendment 1.2 seeks replace wherever reported expression watercraft expression native boat ship referring exclusively recreational craft commercial units would excluded would unjustified exemption penalty generic definition natantante know unit 10 meters boat know unit 10 24 meters ship legal definition unit 24 meters embraced everything considered naval unit whether commercial recreational
#PillonSimone,"PILON L SP PSd Az Mr President boating is one of the sectors in which our country is world class We produce boats boats and ships of excellence but we are also one of the countries that most enjoy the benefits of boating and not only Let 's think about the activities of sport fishing snorkeling diving diving apnea pleasure boating of which I have spoken before but let 's also think about the simple swim that in our almost 9,000 kilometers of coast is always a pleasure to do both in the marine waters and in the inland waters of our lakes and our rivers We are convinced that this law will help to ensure security for this type of activity We are convinced that these rules will increase security in one of the main assets of the country There are stretches of sea coast even lakes and rivers splendid which however are heavily trafficked and which become alas dangerous We have heard the examples that have been made but I believe that each of us has happened at least once in our lives to have a swim and to see a jet ski run very close a dinghy launched at high speed and anything else We must ensure safety including navigation It is true however what Senator Dal Mas said and I agree with that We can't get into panpenalistic thinking It is only with this rule which goes to increase the penalties for anyone committing the crime of manslaughter nautical homicide or manslaughter nautical injuries we have solved the problem It is not the magic wand and I believe that Parliament should take this opportunity to go further into other rules which beyond the criminal dictation help to increase the safety of all those wonderful activities related to the water of the sea the water of our rivers and our lakes We are convinced that from this greater safety of the navigation but also of the enjoyment of our waters will derive a great advantage also for all the sporting enterprises that live of such activity that they live of tourism that they live of fishing that they live of sporting activities tied to navigation Another very important principle which we have reiterated in this regulation and I am convinced that it is important to return to this House is that we do not drive drunk that we do not drive in a state of intoxication or stupefaction Under the effect of psychotropic substances no vehicle is to be driven The life safety and safety of other people and of our person must not be put at risk and this rule reiterates it further Just today in the Childhood Commission we approved the outcome of a survey of young people 's addictions Unfortunately all we have done is to see how there is an increase in addiction to drugs psychotropic substances alcohol This standard gives a clear signal even to young people who might want to take a ride with the jet ski They must know however that they are not driving vehicles that have been altered by alcohol and drugs because this is a risk to their own health and to other people 's health As a League Group we will vote for this rule with conviction I would like to thank as has already been done Senator Balboni who presented this proposal adopted by all political forces in the Justice Commission I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Cucca Mr Ostellari and Mr Sisto who has done so much to get this rule to the House There are two aspects that I would like to explain to my fellow Members before concluding A first aspect which is important to stress is that we took the opportunity to set up two rules of the penal code relating to road traffic which posed serious problems in courtrooms Anyone who has the honour of carrying out the legal profession knows that the reform of road murder and road injuries had two significant limitations a first limit was given by the processability of office of all crimes Those who practice the forensic profession know what we are talking about paradoxically this became a limit At a time when in the face of even minor injuries the criminal proceedings were still open to legal proceedings the offending person was found to have one less weapon in the bargaining with the insurance to obtain a reasonable adequate and short term compensation Returning to the person offended the weapon of the possibility of returning the complaint becomes useful in order to allow the same that is to say those who have suffered injuries illness because of the accident because of others fault to have an additional instrument to obtain the right compensation This is a first rule that we have settled There is a second rule that has been drawn up and that in my opinion it is important that it has been revised by Parliament the one relating to the arrest in flagrante He was conflicting with every common sense rule to provide for the arrest in flagrante for the one who by guilt certainly not by malice had caused of course against his will a car accident and had stopped to ensure immediate help to the victim It is against any logic that that person who has certainly committed a crime and will therefore be judged is dragged away in handcuffs after she has stopped to assist the victim and ensure the immediate arrival of the rescue It is clearly against all common sense besides the fact that that prediction paradoxically favored escape because rather than being arrested at that point someone had the unhealthy temptation to flee to get away If this rule is also approved by the House and we are convinced that this will happen finally the person who caused the sinister as it is will not be arrested in flagency if however he stops to provide assistance to call the rescue will wait for their arrival and will give the necessary help to the offended person This is clearly an incentive to put an end to the terrible phenomenon of road accidents with the escape of the one who caused them I therefore believe that this is a very common sense rule which goes to heal a vulnus I 'll stop here ma'am I can only hope that the House of Deputies will have time to finally approve this draft law in this part session",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,29.944494,-31.382204,31,"pilon l sp psd az mr president boating

#RuspandiniMassimo,Mr President I take the floor on this extremely sensitive issue With the bill signed by Senator Balboni the Brothers of Italy Group demonstrates once again that it is a constructive opposition which we call patriotic because of its quality and responsibility That is why we are proposing today to extend the rules of criminal law for road murder and serious and serious injuries to motor boat drivers As we like to recall Parliament if put to the test and in a position to work knows how to give answers and that is why I want to publicly thank Senator Balboni for his sensitivity and for the work he has done aimed at perfecting the regulatory framework which needed this approach In the sea in fact for a number of worrying reasons that I am not here to list there is no security and you risk your life too many times As the rapporteur also said newspapers and newspapers report the many tragedies that occur especially in summer periods in lakes and seas and in which all too often children lose their lives There are so many reasons including carelessness The Coast Guard has no means of providing security for its citizens That is why a law that introduces the crime of nautical murder becomes indispensable and that regulates it with the same discipline as for the road murder In our examination of the draft law boaters at the helm of motor boats with the effect for example of alcohol or drugs which cause the death of a person or cause serious injuries are considered as the driver of the car who commits the same crime It seems to everyone not only to me I believe clearly insane and unacceptable that the person responsible for a death driving a car risks 18 years in jail while instead if he is driving a boat he risks a sentence that can be only six months There was a vulnus in our system that we took responsibility for trying to fill For this reason I thank the Brothers of Italy Group and Senator Balboni it needed a piece that could protect the lives of thousands and thousands of citizens It is a strong signal precisely because it is a rule that can act as a deterrent for an invitation to caution to anyone who is riding a boat I agree with the rapporteur 's words that these very high speed motorboats are increasingly being used by people without licences and also let us say the ability to use the same vehicle It is a bit wide from the point of view of permissiveness in the use of these powerful boats especially during the summer The bill before us I would like to stress this presents another very important aspect that is that raised by the lawyering of the criminal chambers which follows a proposal of law of our leader Ciriani aimed at alleviating the inflamed courts and giving the possibility to resolve small private conflicts in a bonaria way especially those concerning road accidents It is another sign of civilization that shows how the bill really goes in the right direction,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,29.910332,-31.474977,31,mr president take floor extremely sensitive issue bill signed senator balboni brothers italy group demonstrates constructive opposition call patriotic quality responsibility proposing today extend rules criminal law road murder serious serious injuries motor boat drivers like recall parliament put test position work knows give answers want publicly thank senator balboni sensitivity work done aimed perfecting regulatory framework needed approach sea fact number worrying reasons list security risk life many times rapporteur also said newspapers newspapers report many tragedies occur especially summer periods lakes seas often children lose lives many reasons including carelessness coast guard means providing security citizens law introduces crime nautical murder becomes indispensable regulates discipline road murder examination draft law boaters helm motor boats effect example alcohol drugs cause death person cause serious injuries considered driver car commits crime seems everyone believe clearly insane unacceptable person responsible death driving car risks 18 years jail instead driving boat risks sentence six months vulnus system took responsibility trying fill reason thank brothers italy group senator balboni needed piece could protect lives thousands thousands citizens strong signal precisely rule act deterrent invitation caution anyone riding boat agree rapporteur 's words high speed motorboats increasingly used people without licences also let us say ability use vehicle bit wide point view permissiveness use powerful boats especially summer bill us would like stress presents another important aspect raised lawyering criminal chambers follows proposal law leader ciriani aimed alleviating inflamed courts giving possibility resolve small private conflicts bonaria way especially concerning road accidents another sign civilization shows bill really goes right direction
#PirovanoDaisy,"PIROVANO L SP PSd Az Mr President how much is human life worth You can measure it in gold teeth to make bars you can measure it in hair to make mattresses you can measure it in ashes to make fertilizers These are the things we see with our own eyes when we go to the concentration camps Two years ago on 27 January 2020 I spoke in this House on the occasion of Memory Day to present the motion and at the same time the relevant bill A few days later on February 22 2020 the Covid arrived in Bergamo and I as mayor was absent from the Assembly for a long time to manage the emergency The bill remained frozen in the middle of the pandemic but on the way I realized that it had become even more important for what happened in these two years How much is a human life worth 1,500 lire for a Jewish child 3,000 lire for a woman 5,000 for a man that 's the amount that those in our country denounced the Jews to send them to the concentration camps At Auschwitz four huge gas chambers which were able to kill in the best days for them up to 6,000 people were the pride of Rudolf Hess An economy the German economy which prospered not only on forced labour in the camps but also on the very death of the Jews Jews who were betrayed by the government that was to protect them How much is a human life worth How many GDP points are we willing to lose to save lives According to some economists a man 's value is calculated on the basis of his country 's GDP In Italy a human life is worth 4.7 million dollars at Bermuda 15,5 in Burundi only 45,000 It seems that this tendency to quantify the value of life on the basis of the ability to produce income derives from slavery from the plantations of South Carolina in 1740 Disabled people were also an economic burden for the Nazis and they also found death in concentration camps For two years I have been wondering how much a human life is worth two years in which the phenomena of hate incitement have increased in a worrying way also towards the Jews For someone still today in the gas chambers they showered for someone the shoah is an invention for someone they died but not just like that and not so many for someone in the Bergamo military truck there were empty coffins It seems that in every historical epoch the logic of negationism is to reverse cause with effect because according to the negationists of the shoah the Allies needed the myth of the Holocaust to justify the occupation of Germany in 1945 I say this just to give an example but there would be many more Similarly limiting individual freedom to prevent the whole country from suffering like my people has been translated into a phrase of the kind with the Covid 's excuse this law has been made In fact denying a people what caused deep suffering is something inhuman that increases pain amplifies it and does not allow to heal wounds Denialism however is not only ignorance but above all fear because it is a classic defence mechanism psychological denial the fear that man can really be capable of such atrocities which is better to deny But man is really capable of it Is it afraid that if it were true if one day someone woke up and said he wanted to exterminate all those with brown hair a person with brown hair how could he fight against those who want to destroy it Simply remembering that courage is what changes the destiny of a people because evil men have always been there and will always be there because a madman can wake up one day and be followed by others who perhaps for political economic or personal interests give him rope without even realizing where he is going of what tragedy he is creating In every age we are always busy doing something else having more and more things or having more and more likes while memory is the only thing we have to make history plot an experience of thousands of years and it is impossible for each of us to keep it if it is not handed down by generations Young people will be our salvation perhaps even some of those who have been or who will travel to the concentration camps because it is enough that only one understands that it has really happened and can happen again However before giving them wings to fly as this Parliament should do by law making with our Government they must reach the depths of the abyss of the human soul and see clearly what can happen and what they might have to defend in the future from what they might have to defend their loved ones Today I learned by chance that this very day Virginia Gattegno a survivor of Auschwitz was missing was born in Rome in 1923 She was ninety eight years old her family was exterminated only her sister Lea survived This woman who left us on this very day lived in Venice where she had moved after the war and where she was a teacher having dedicated her whole life to teaching children who had an exceptional teacher I would like to read his poem because she was also a poet entitled Forget Auschwitz I wish my daughters had a happy life I would like a God to wait for me at the end of my life but above all I would like to forget Auschwitz but I can't I can't Instead we must not forget and we must ensure that when there is no longer even the last of the survivors someone carries on the memory not only in the books but with the testimonies and with the trips on the spot During this terrible pandemic I had the enormous fortune to personally meet Senator Segre with whom we collaborate in the Commission of which I have the honour of being Vice President I do n't like to look at people for the role they have for the officiality and for the whole construction that is done around a human being But as such Senator Segre is an example to me of how you can stay happy with a huge pain inside how you can stay smiling and make humor with a great intelligence This means that evil becomes a warning the evil that someone has suffered and the pain that someone has experienced and that you dedicate your life a part of your life to ensure that others do not feel what you have felt I would like to thank Mrs Saponara the whole 7th Commission and the undersecretary of Floridia Although the examination of

#PizzolNadia,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen senators and representatives of the Government we are today called upon to approve the draft law on the development and competitiveness of organic farming agri-food and aquaculture The organic farming sector is constantly growing and Italy represents the third European country with over 2 million hectares cultivated by 80,000 farms It is a cultivation that grows year by year and represents 16 of the agricultural area used in our country Organic products are very popular and it is a growing market increased by consumption that increases every year In Italy the organic product market has a turnover of 3.6 billion annually and the decrease of imports from third countries allows us to give a greater value to Italian products whose demand on the other hand grows abroad Thanks to the great growth in both consumption and production organic farming is now able to generate new jobs and above all to expand youth entrepreneurship In fact 20 of young farmers are approaching organic farming which is considered as a concrete possibility to expand their economic activities particularly in hill and foothill areas where intensive agriculture is not very sustainable as is the case in flat land This allows to enhance the typicality of local and regional products as happened in Trentino Alto Adige where alongside the numerous agricultural crops organic districts have been promoted understood as local production systems integrated with agricultural vocation characterized by a significant presence of organic production In addition the methods of breeding and processing typical of the place have been protected The rule we are debating today can therefore add value to our agriculture by supporting our high quality products which represent the modern response to the local traditions that come from the roots of our culture and the identity of our territories and it is a law that our farmers have been asking us for years The forecast of the supply chain table Article 16 for organic products will help to promote and organise an efficient market for organic products and ensure the conclusion of so called supply chain contracts Organic farming is considered to be a privileged production technique for achieving all the environmental objectives envisaged This is in a very specific context in which the European Union with the green new deal the Farm to fork and with the protection of biodiversity has set a clear horizon and commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions protecting biodiversity and creating a less environmentally friendly food production system The European Union also plans to invest over EUR 40 million annually to promote the organic farming method and sees this type of crop as an instrument to enhance and protect the protection of biodiversity for a more sustainable agriculture The action plan envisages supporting consumption increasing organic production throughout Europe and introducing a new regulation to simplify procedures revisit controls and strengthen them for organic products coming from third countries The above is part of a more general framework of European agricultural and environmental policies aimed at reducing the use of plant protection products by 50 and the loss of soil nutrients by 50 improving their quality PRESIDENT The debate is closed Come on and finish Thank you Mr Pizzol L SP PSd Az The draft law on the subject today underlines that organic production is a comprehensive system for the management of the farm and the protection of food production a method based on the interaction between best environmental practices aimed at safeguarding natural resources and sustainable development These production methods are based on prepared and specific disciplinary methods applied in compliance with the provisions and regulations of the European Union and national rules on organic farming with the obligation to provide all information on the origin quality and traceability of organic products Thus there will be greater guarantees of third parties in the subjects authorized to control",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#BruzzoneFrancesco,BRUZZONE L SP PSd Az Mr President I know that I am monotonous yet again speaking in this House on the problem of excessive wildlife particularly wild boars In the course of all the reports I have had in this House I have almost had the opportunity to say that children will soon be eating Unfortunately we got there and it's not a simple joke the other night in Castellaneta Marina in the province of Taranto a teenager while playing a ball game in the square as we use to do was attacked by a wild boar with one arm and one hand It could have been much worse if the boar had continued in the other parts of the body The boy was emergency surgery at the Bari Hospital and today we do not know if he will return to have a normal use of the arm and hand I am sorry to have to say these things and have to be angry for the umpteenth time there have been too many rejections even formal ones compared to proposals that have been made by us in this House to change the rule that would allow the number of boars in our country to be reduced to those who are willing to do this civil service today i.e. who is in possession of the license to be able to shoot them down However it can not be done because the stubbornness of someone who reigns in a part of this House has prevented it Even a few weeks ago an important exponent of the Movimento 5 Stars in this House claimed that hunting is barbaric Today I say that barbarism is the boar that you eat the child and shame is being on the side of the boar rather than on the side of the child I see however that we still want to go on like this It is therefore urgent to lay down and bury this extremist animalism to amend Law 157 of 1992 to allow us to do what I said before Here I say it and I would not want anyone to have the opportunity to misread my words this boar has anticipated the occupation of another What will happen in the near future unfortunately in our country because of the excessive presence of wolves an exaggerated number compared to what our country could contain It is not the rally of a hunter who has no interest as the category of hunters does not to go and shoot wolves,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,26.241453,-24.178986,31,bruzzone l sp psd az mr president know monotonous yet speaking house problem excessive wildlife particularly wild boars course reports house almost opportunity say children soon eating unfortunately got simple joke night castellaneta marina province taranto teenager playing ball game square use attacked wild boar one arm one hand could much worse boar continued parts body boy emergency surgery bari hospital today know return normal use arm hand sorry say things angry umpteenth time many rejections even formal ones compared proposals made us house change rule would allow number boars country reduced willing civil service today i.e. possession license able shoot however done stubbornness someone reigns part house prevented even weeks ago important exponent movimento 5 stars house claimed hunting barbaric today say barbarism boar eat child shame side boar rather side child see however still want go like therefore urgent lay bury extremist animalism amend law 157 1992 allow us said say would want anyone opportunity misread words boar anticipated occupation another happen near future unfortunately country excessive presence wolves exaggerated number compared country could contain rally hunter interest category hunters go shoot wolves
#BruzzoneFrancesco,"BRUZZONE L SP PSd Az Mr President we are about to vote on a measure which is as important as it is urgent which has been waiting for a few months now since 7 January when the first positive case was found in a carcass found slightly outside a regional natural park that of the Capanne di Marcarolo in the province of Alexandria where this virus was supposedly born and developed However despite the lack and also the lack of the government decree immediate interventions at the territorial level mostly focused on monitoring to understand what happened around that positive case I must thank here a few thousand volunteers nominally authorized one by one by the two regions involved For example as far as my region is concerned there are 1,618 volunteers mostly hunters who have joined together perhaps for the first time all the other outdoor users walkers bikers and all the others in a search for the infected carcasses A volunteering aimed at the general interest of society and also of the economy for the reasons that have been well said in practically all the interventions that have been carried out today African swine fever is dangerous for domestic pig farms and for turnover Piedmont has about 1.35 million heads of pigs Lombardy 6 million Emilia which is nearby as many The Regions particularly Piemonte and Liguria immediately became active but Lombardy Emilia and Tuscany have also done so together with the Ministries of Health and Agriculture and the problem has been addressed To date indeed to last evening the updated data is 490 carcasses found on the territory by these volunteers of which 74 positive to African swine fever all in the province of Genoa and Alexandria In the general misfortune there was a positive fact that the virus was found and developed within artificial boundaries namely two highways the A7 and the A26 enclosed in the North by the junction between the two highways Only in the Ovadese do we have six cases that have crossed the barrier of the highways which have a fence which occasionally gets knocked down because there have also been accidents with wild boars on those highways but it is difficult to pass two carriageways with two fences Two positive cases went through the Arquata Scrivia area This figure determines the urgency of containment operations especially from the points where the motorway barriers have been crossed The urgency stems from the fact that today we are going to vote on this measure with a hope that it will become as soon as possible the law of the State which will be published in the Official Journal In these weeks probably already on Friday the two Regions will produce the Plan provided by the decree for the contrast to the PSA with the possibility finally to derogate also from some outdoor activities Think that this area where you can't walk and you can't do anything includes about a million inhabitants How many dogs of affection and for other activities held by a million inhabitants who since January are forced to walk only on the asphalt and cannot go on the dirt road That is the further reason for the urgency What are the difficulties of a part of the red area that of the Riviera di Ponente for example that from Arenzano ends at the border with the municipality of Savona to Albissola Marina where nothing can be done except to go on the asphalt or to the limit on the beach or if you have the courage even at sea And we are faced with a period when tourism after having suffered the problems of the Covid should start again as well as the hinterland with the area of the two parks that are penalized President We shall vote firmly and vigorously in favour of this measure and I would like to thank my fellow rapporteurs Mr Bergesio and Mr Biti the Presidents of the Commissions 9a and 12a and the Government However I must make a few considerations because I am not used to acting or holding back within the limits of regularity That is what Mr Taricco said before the right presence of the boar in those areas as in many others should be one head square kilometre as ISPRA says There we are at 14 15 garments per square kilometre and this figure will increase shortly for the reproduction that is in progress Let me say one thing with my heart we have spoken on this subject several times and we are convinced that we were not mad when we said that we had to intervene to allow for a greater reduction of wild boars We do n't think we were crazy when we talked about damage to agriculture or the need to reduce the number of road accidents On the occasion all the dead that have been there should also be remembered I was n't crazy when even naively I wondered what would happen with all these animals if an epidemic broke out I called it that then I said these words in the Chamber a peacemaker will happen Nothing to do and five times now for the sixth time the Senate and the House could not bring to completion the necessary amendment of Law No 157 of 1992 which could have prevented the overpopulation of these animals No way Why Maybe we can't make it clear that the moment has come when we have to abandon the imaginative vision of the boar to protect that still today someone has The ecological methods have not worked so far and unfortunately do not work I would like to thank that part of the Democratic Party which has set aside this idea which has also appeared in the Commission 's work In the Commission we have even heard together with the proposal to eradicate PSA without cutting down a boar that of killing only the sick first we catch them we take their blood tests and then we decide whether or not they should be killed In the face of these things it is necessary to return with your feet on the ground We must understand ladies and gentlemen that the chicken breast is not born in a supermarket in a plastic box Says a Genoese it is not nice for anyone to see wild boars rumble and dig among the graves of the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno in Genoa it is not a good thing I truly say this with my heart for once to those who still hold things so anachronistic and distant from reality think of trying to descend from this five star cloud because it is necessary to stand on the ground Every once in a while everyone likes to be in the clouds but when you 're in front of serious things like this come back dear colleagues on earth 15:43 BRUZZONE followed I do not want to make any particular mention but sometimes the experience the reality the ability to deal with problems must fall on the needs of the territory and on what they have taught us To make you understand what agro silvo pastoral territory and rural activities mean you may have been told that the cow gives you milk but the cow does not give us milk and if you believed it you were wrong As a child they taught me that if you want milk you have to get up at 4:00 in the morning take the bucket and the car seat go there and get your shoes dirty and your hands dirty because the milk does n't come looking for you in the supermarket So if we 're gonna try to eradicate swine fever we 're gonna have to give up some of those

#FregolentSonia,Mr President ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to thank Senator Bergesio and Senator Biti for the work they have done together with all the members of the Commission their respective Presidents and Minister Patuanelli for their attention to the important measure we are considering today The members of the Commission have worked actively and constructively recognizing the serious risk that we are taking As is well known since January 7 last the presence of African swine fever of wild boar in the neighbouring Provinces of Genoa and Alexandria has been detected on the Italian territory We are aware of the details of the disease which have already been discussed in detail by the previous rapporteurs and colleagues The cases found were concentrated in the area between the two motorways A25 and A7 but recently we are witnessing the finding of positive carcasses beyond this perimeter sign that the highways do not represent an obstacle to the movement of wild boars with consequent spread of the disease This requires a reflection on the need to approve the measure in question quickly so that the resources reach the regions in good time just think that we are already in April These are urgent measures aimed at preventing the movement of wild boar by next summer Soon in fact the season of the parts will begin with a doubling of the number of wild boars and consequently starting next June the infection could undergo a significant acceleration determined by the new born That is why the measure we are debating is urgent It is therefore essential to strengthen the fences already present on the roads that delimit the infected area as well as to build ex novo where possible physical barriers that secure the boundaries of the restricted area The fences are certainly the most effective tool to proceed with the containment of wild boars and for this reason have been destined 10 million euros although we are aware that the orographic conformation of the territory will not make it easy to place them There is therefore a real possibility that the virus may spread among wild boars in a much larger area including both particularly rugged mountainous areas of difficult accessibility and with a high intensity of this population and urban areas where wild boars live accustomed to man 's proximity Removable fences and temporary structures must be carried out by the regions concerned by way of derogation from the provisions of the building regulations and those on environmental impact assessment and in the presence of landscape constraints by means of a simplified procedure This step is also fundamental in order to keep the times to the maximum for their realization the times are in fact the crucial factor One of the objectives for which the Commissions have worked has been the eradication of the disease although it is aware that this is an arduous goal which requires seriousness and method in the approach Synergy between the various administrations involved and stakeholders including farmers and hunters will be needed with the depopulation of wild boars In this context leadership and coordination by regions and public veterinary services will be essential The other objective was to protect the Italian pig supply chain and export considering that several countries such as Japan and China but also Taiwan Thailand Mexico Peru Ecuador the Philippines and South Africa have immediately undertaken a protectionist policy and in this sense have closed their market to meat and all pigmeat products The Association of Meats and Cold cuts Assica and the Union national food supply chains meat and eggs UnaItalia estimate in addition to the damages suffered directly by the breeders in the infected areas and in the surrounding areas a damage extended to the meat and cold cuts sector of at least 20 million euros per month only for the failure to export It is therefore not a hunting of wild boars which however if affected by disease would not live in any case but the survival of an entire agri -food sector that is fundamental for our economy and for hundreds of companies and workers who ask us to do quickly The League will continue to work to protect the activities of those living in the red zone and who during this period of the year see different work activities excluded access to parks and various activities related to tourism and hospitality currently in great difficulty In this respect we also had an amendment which we tabled and which unfortunately did not find any room for acceptance This is certainly a measure of common sense and even if criticism arrives because this is the country where it is easier to criticize regardless of building we are interested in intervening and intervening soon so that it is not too late and the costs do not become ten times as much Our response ladies and gentlemen must necessarily be as compact and rapid as
