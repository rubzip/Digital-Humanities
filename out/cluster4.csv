#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,I am asking for the floor under Rule 72 1 and 2 of the Rules of Procedure of the House pursuant to which I requested the reading of Article 166 of the Constitution This is because two parliamentary groups in this House have submitted their appeals to the Constitutional Court on the understanding that Amendments 61 and 62 incorporated into the text of the proposed law which is intended to be debated in this plenary imply a spurious reform of the provisions of Article 159.3 of the Constitution so that the court is urged to take very precautionary measures It therefore requested that this plenary should be postponed until the Constitutional Court had ruled on these very precautionary measures,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,-21.619476,13.215969,4
#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,Article 166 of the Constitution states that the constitutional reform initiative shall be carried out in accordance with the terms of Article 87 1 and 2 which is precisely why we call for the suspension of this plenary until the Constitutional Court is determined on the very precautionary measures that the People 's Party and the VOX Parliamentary Group have requested,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,-21.603136,13.27882,4

#PazzagliniGiuliano,Crazy people L SP PSd Az Mr President of course I welcome the call for a time limit to allow the final vote on the measure before the suspension but I do not think that I have a written statement to leave to the proceedings I should like to start by starting from the point of view that I have been given some inaccuracies which I have heard from some of my colleagues who have spoken earlier The process of the measure under consideration began during the Government Count 1 also participated by the League then developed in three further passages with changes introduced first in the reading of the Chamber of Deputies then again in the reading of the Senate and this has meant the lengthening of the times until today Thus four passages have been made in the parliamentary assemblies today's is the fourth and three different governments Having said that I think it is understandable to understand why there is already a deadline in the measure for which I presented an agenda to the Commission inviting the Government to remedy as soon as the measure is approved The agenda has also been signed by many other colleagues from the Commission 's territory environment environmental goods perhaps by everyone and will therefore ensure that as soon as the measure is enacted action can be taken to update this deadline Having undertaken to contract the time I will not go into the substance of the measure but I want to make some explicit references I am thinking for example of what is expressly indicated in Article 1 we are talking about the restoration of the marine ecosystem the promotion of the economy virtuous behavioral models and it is this last point that I think I should go into with a little reflection These measures are important to me because Article 1 expressly indicates an objective which has been achieved in part in mountain areas where the symbiosis man-territory has always developed making it clear that the uses traditions virtuous behaviours even regulated in acts which for example involved the obligation for the frontists to clean up the riverbed had to be replicated also in the waters including rivers since it is true that the provision is called saving the sea but also includes in it what happens on rivers lakes and indeed sea This allows me to reply to some of my colleagues who have regretted the lack of incentives for this which we would obviously have appreciated too but I do not know a farmer or operator who does not make improvements in the workplace or on his own ground if it is those who make agriculture Therefore to move from a system that implicitly first brought fishermen to put back into the sea the collected waste because it was special waste to a system that instead allows it to give them for disposal free of charge and without administrative difficulties because they are equated to ordinary waste like the waste of the ships I would say that it is a huge improvement I therefore would have appreciated if there had been contributions in this regard but as a person who comes from the mountain and knows that the care of his garden let 's call it improperly is responsibility before every person who carries out that activity but above all it is something that he does voluntarily in my opinion already in itself this justifies the fact that he hopes to be able to leave a better world to future generations as someone said with this measure In this sense I allow myself to open a small personal parenthesis because on the day of the completion of the eighteen years of my oldest daughter for me it is a pleasure as a father to be able to approve a measure that will help to create the possibility of leaving for her in fact a better world In compliance with the commitment to contract the times I start with the conclusions declaring the favorable vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Group Party of Action because we are aware that we are not trying a measure that alone will solve all the problems of the sea but this is called decree law and not magic wand or something that is not in our possibilities therefore pragmatically as a concrete person I recognize that there are limits and that it would have been possible to improve it further as is always possible for any measure but I believe that the innovation introduced with this measure with what will be possible to do after we have approved it alone justifies the fact that our vote will be favorable 11:49 a.m,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-22.950293,1.755468,4
