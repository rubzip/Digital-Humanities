#JuanLuisSteegmannOlmedillas,Thank you very much With venial Mr. President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Ladies and gentlemen spring is already intuited spring is intuited as you were two years ago How happy you promised them after you had agreed the government of the monster with the Catalan separatists with those of the axe and the snake with those of the nuts How they enjoyed those who were going to storm the heavens and stayed in the capon When the Wuhan virus killed thousands of Chinese nothing happened because they were Chinese like banning a manifestation by the coronavirus when it was something that came from the East Coronavirus hey their spokesmen sang a flu the doctors of the regime said they die with coronavirus not by coronavirus they said They denied the reality of the virus just to do their little party on March 8th Two years ago but it looks like ten Minister Since then no one will be able to shout live on March 8th without their mouth being filled with flavor to crematorium ash That date is stained forever no one will be able to celebrate it without remembering all the dead that caused that manifestation For us these deaths have names and surnames they are not numbers and there will be no amnesia and there will be justice That viral bomb was possible because the protesters were lied to and the virus spread throughout Spain You Minister were there and suffered its consequences So there are only two options one of them is that he was lied to and the other I can't think of mentioning it To celebrate his feast he lied to the Council of Ministers because now we do know that they had much more information than they gave us Not only did they lie to VOX but they lied to all the Spaniards In that lie they were assisted by the brigade of left wing doctors who now continue to make predictions making them the ball His talking puppet that of 'some cases at most despised the death of the elderly lied about the masks lied about the tests everything to justify an unforeseeability and imperience of the government He counted the thousands of dead with a lunatic smile before Mr. Illa 's funeral gaze Woe to him who took the opposite Because there was a gentleman dressed uniformly and with brushed hair telling us that they were going to watch over the non-addicts to the regime They infected us with lies locked us up illegally with lies and so they made us sick and ruined us with tricks They have varied all epidemiological measurements they have broken the series they have made coherent follow up impossible ladies and gentlemen With lies they declared that they had defeated the virus and the Spaniards continued to die With lies they said that 70 of Spaniards were going to be vaccinated before July 2021 and the Spaniards continued to die Our parliamentary group warned them about vaccines about variants about natural immunity about group immunity We proposed that you buy more vaccines at any price you rejected the motion And the delta variant came and Spanish people continued to die You and the nefarious and nefarious autonomy have confabulated to hide the data two years of epidemic and we do not have a common database and to give inconsistent messages time from induction to depression to more irrelevant and incoherent optimism from black to pink According to their partisan interests instead of funded masks and cheap self diagnosis tests all Taifas Reyezuels have chosen to lock us up and prohibit our mobility The COVID passport has been a gross blackmail to induce vaccination a futile and possibly harmful blackmail Our group ladies and gentlemen has been committed to science and there are our interventions Yes Mr Meijón there are our initiatives to contradict your infuses and those of your accomplices Always for the truthfulness of the data always for the tests and then for the vaccines which we consider the main weapon against the virus and always always ladies and gentlemen for freedom Unlike other groups we believe in the responsibility of the Spaniards Against the confinements we bet that the Spaniards move freely throughout Spain without any other requirement than the DNI We have opposed any measures of vaccination obligation against COVID and have denounced the COVID passport as I said as blackmailer and useless That 's where we were when the omicron variant came in infecting everywhere like a fire in a pine tree Good thing science and industry have invented and manufactured the vaccine you as far as I know have n't invented or manufactured anything just bought it Ladies and gentlemen there is a huge difference between forcing and recommending The recommendation requires an explanation for which it recommends and requires understanding effort for which it receives the recommendation It is the difference between ordering a brute and educating a human being Only opportunism and propaganda have gone to the Government as shown in the subject of outdoor masks I sang one day on the subject of pensions and days later as were the elections of Castile and León in progress so come on we suppressed them All right The outdoor masks have been maintained Minister because they are simply an avatar of collective confinement As the Constitutional Court has said that you have illegally confined the Spaniards for come on let 's put on masks Pedagogy The process of searching for scientific truth is based ladies and gentlemen on the experience of the experiment which in turn is based on the pulsity of methods on the strength given by the great numbers and on the continuous monitoring of the effects in time but above all on intellectual honesty and deliberation among those who know We must explain to the people not to the people but to the people it seems they do not like the people that in the face of any major problem in science there are questions for which we have answers there are questions for which we do not know their answer and there are questions that we have not imagined to ask them and that one day I suppose we will do them That 's the worst In short ignorance must be recognized in science and politics because this process of truth seeking must also permeate political action The bad policy is that of the ignorant who presumes that he knows to justify what he wants to do anyway is the dictatorship of the incompetent and that ladies and gentlemen has to change and is going to change This sixth wave is running out We all want it to be the last and some are even convinced it will be What have we learned That we have to adapt our measures to reality that the totalitarians of all parties prefer to confine themselves to investing in protection and medicines that it is likely that that virus seeder that is the Chinese markets will continue to inject itself and that it is not impossible for the virus to surprise us again That is why we are questioning the Government and asking how it is going to detect the evolution of the virus in one direction or another We need to know a lot ladies and gentlemen We need to know all the characteristics at least the most important especially of the hospitalized of those of the ICU and above all of the deceased We need to know their social and economic conditions not that postal code course the diseases they suffer the medicines they take if they had been infected before the vaccines they have received the time that has passed between the last dose and admission to the hospital and we need to know very important the immune state of the Spaniards We need to know all this ladies and gentlemen because we need not only to know better about the virus but also to know who we must protect as a matter of priority who we must vaccinate again and who are the candidates for the different medicines It 's over This epidemic and the treacherous arbitrary and irrational management of governments have not only caused suffering and death but have inflicted enormous damage on the already scarce confidence of the people in politicians The prestige of our sanity has been brought into shambles it 's almost sinking But there is one thing there is no sensible person in this country who does not recognize that we would be much worse if it were not for science science has saved us Ladies and gentlemen I 'm finishing up We do n't know what the future is preparing for us Anyone who says he knows or is a madman or a liar and politicians and scientists involved in politicians must stop being pythonous from three to four I was beginning by saying that today is the beginning of spring ladies and gentlemen because it is science that has brought it with vaccines and new medicines No doubt there are strong reasons for hope and we are closer to regaining the life we had before the epidemic Ladies and gentlemen this moment that we are living now can be forever or it can be a mere transitional period even if it lasts for years In any case we have to put an end to the policies of the fatty brush the time has come for the health policy of precision We need to know exactly who we need to protect and who we do n't we need to know exactly when we need to act and when we do n't For that we need Minister continuous and true information Out of respect for the dead and the pain of their families out of respect for the sick and because we must be prepared for future epidemics that will come we ask the Government on that journey Mrs Darias are you going to follow the difficult path of science or are you going to take as you have done so far that of totalitarianism and arbitrariness Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,26.694824,20.715801,33,thank much venial mr. president good morning ladies gentlemen ladies gentlemen spring already intuited spring intuited two years

#VíctorManuelSánchezDelReal,Very good is n't it Independence plurality First of all Minister you 're a lawyer man It was on the agenda how are you talking about traps if it was on the agenda accepted by the whole House and the whole Bureau Do not cheat you are being recorded and you are a lawyer although it has already been shown that it is not extraordinarily good He 's not a good propagandist either You 're so predictable that even a fellow from the smallest of the communication agencies knows the speech you 're going to make I told you we won the bingo not the line we did the bingo twice There are nineteen times you have said far right if you add up thirty two disqualifications and without the Bureau telling you anything There she is come on Yeah yeah I told him I was going to laugh because he gave neither one argument nor one justification for independence Visits to Moncloa is that independence is that parliamentary control You say you read me Article 20 of the Constitution You follow the parliamentary sessions that go on what you are going to talk about because yesterday I was the one who spoke of Article 20.3 of the Constitution which speaks of parliamentary control Are the visits to the Moncloa parliamentary control Is it putting your hands on the board of directors and reinforcing it by royal decree not coming to this House parliamentary control That is not parliamentary control Mr. Minister of Ancient Propaganda You in your speech are so predictable that we know what you 're going to say You 've gone to the disqualification of the group By the way you said we 're 0.0 could you give me the data We are four million Spaniards who support 52 Members And you say we 're the ones with the lies Look there are now three or four deputies This is the importance that PP attaches to the control of Spanish Radiotelevision Three or four Members present here Sure If you 're willing to make a deal with yourselves If we are the only voice that tells you to stop getting your hands on what you say is independent Because you have the quail that I broke the box I repeat to say that it is independent But if you have summoned to Moncloa who is your candidate By the way the new provisional presidency for propaganda comes from one you always talk about compound surnames in my case the Del Real is from one place and the De Luna are from another place You on top of that do not even know where the socialist family names come from the socialist families are indeed of the Abolene rancio of the Abolene rancio socialist The new interim president comes from an Abolengo rancio with a service sheet from her partner high ranking PSOE the construction of a lot of prisons at the time of Felipe González We are talking about the person who dedicated himself to selling the land of the Spanish Radiotelevision entity the sale of Prado del Rey is the partner of Miguel Barroso You say we mess with private television but if you 're a public concession you 've given it to them Either they 're public concession or they 're private If you want to be private issue for example in digital only in digital But for that there is no courage because they really like to be in the mood to have a license that you the public funds that you give them through the campaigns and the funds that you receive from Spanish Television because Miguel Barroso and company and Roures and company are the ones who above do the programs that the professionals of the Spanish Radio Television house do not do Minister of Propaganda if you are going to be the Minister of Propaganda learn at least the subject which you do not know You can tell me twenty thirty or forty times I will add at the end of the session ultra ultra ultra that I say ista ista ista For these are their customs to sell the land to have their friends companions comrades brothers husbands and wives being the ones who sell and get into the coffer and end up on the boards of directors another case to finger or are the ones who make the bargain with the money of all the Spaniards Minister get your hands off Spanish Radiotelevision stop your propaganda act Because I do n't know if you 're doing propaganda to campaign for Don Pedro Sánchez who does n't know if he 's going to be a candidate but that 's where it was said to be you By the way I was delighted to see the very modern Mr Zaragoza approach you to give I understand a last minute advice to such a moderate minister Otherwise we would have gone to thirty or forty insults per minute which is Mr Zaragoza 's shooting ratio But well I was delighted to see him moreover I was delighted to see him sitting as a minister I 'm very fond of Mr. Zaragoza But this campaign I repeat smells like election campaign and I love this smell because it is a smell of decomposition of your government and of struggle for who will stay the PSOE 's mess and what remains of the PSOE after the next elections so you are taking control of each and every propaganda mechanism in this country own semi-pensioners semi-private non-citizens whatever you can They 're breaking the emergency glass to see how they can convince the Spaniards that this this this has to go on but they 're actually going to go home forever And leave the insults to another than to me Mr. Platero not to me Thank you very
