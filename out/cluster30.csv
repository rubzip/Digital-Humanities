#JuanLuisSteegmannOlmedillas,"Mr. President come on Ladies and gentlemen a personal note My work as a hematologist and Chernobyl headquarters have led me to collaborate with my colleagues in Kiev Let me send from here my words of support to Dr. Dyagil Dr. Lopina and Dr. Dmytrenko Dr. Krasnow Dr. Timoshenko Dr. Bazyka and Dr. Klimenko and so many others who are taking care of their compatriots and fighting for their freedom in the face of Putin 's bloody dictatorship By the way ladies and gentlemen if anyone had come up to this rostrum and said that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has ended total 150 dead a day and from now on we will consider it an incident and we have decided that we will not report you would take your hands to the head right Well the government of Sánchez and Darias wants to make an information blackout and end the epidemic by decree And I 'm afraid the virus may disagree The motion we put forward ladies and gentlemen to launch a national database against the open source epidemic is based on three pillars first the sixth wave is in decline second we are going to enter a truce period and third the truce is likely not to be permanent Therefore we must be prepared Today is March 8 the 2020 date that the Carlos III Institute of Health not me defined as the shooting date of the epidemic the shooting date of Wuhan 's coronavirus because it was Communist China who blamed the virus and West and especially the Spanish government for letting it in That shot has killed thousands of women and their partners and their parents and grandparents And VOX wo n't forget you and we wo n't forgive you ladies and gentlemen This epidemic Mr President has been that of misinformation and I am not referring to that of the ignorant nor to the bots of Xi Jinping or Putin nor I am referring to the most important that of the government and that of its autonomous governments They have all varied case definitions depending on whether or not they had reactive devices altered measurements and broken the continuity of the time series tricks that have prevented consistent follow up and therefore analysis and criticism The sanitary tariff service has prevented us from having a common database two years after the epidemic and the darkness of information has allowed them to give terrifying or optimistic messages depending on their partisan interests They have continued to frighten us in the sixth wave with the same intensity as at the beginning of the epidemic despite the success of vaccines and the lesser lethality of omicron which is currently 0.9 of those infected From our group we make it very clear we demand the truth and we do not want dictators who pretend to know it when they ignore it Ladies and gentlemen decision making in politics must be based on true information and democracy is based only on an educated and informed people Already since June 2020 statisticians and epidemiologists have realized that one could contribute to the fight against the epidemic if one had a database one national two anonymous three open source and four with free access to any citizen and allowing researchers to collaborate with this poor Ministry of Health that we have weakened by health transfers These researchers indirectly exposed us to this motion because it is very likely that Communist China will infect us again Ladies and gentlemen we still ignore many things about COVID 19 we ignore fundamental things We need to know all the individual conditions that influence their severity the efficacy and toxicity of vaccines in post -COVID syndrome We need to know exactly who we need to protect and who we do n't we need to know when we need to act and when we do n't That is why we need the truth and that information will enable citizens to defend themselves against the authoritarianism of the rulers of all parties Look as a doctor I 've almost never imposed anything I 've given recommendations as politicians in this epidemic we must all do the same recommend Our compatriots want to know the truth to make their own decisions finally ladies and gentlemen to be free and we could approach the truth ladies and gentlemen with this tool that we propose It is a feasible tool ladies and gentlemen that Excel that we all use can admit a 1,049 000 rows and almost 17,000 columns Of course it is the health authorities who have to fill that database and that is the secret because an open database not only informs but forces the rulers to give true and verifiable information We need it not only for SARS CoV 2 but for future epidemics to come to come Ladies and gentlemen this moment of truce that has given us the virus and the effectiveness of vaccines is the time to prepare for difficult times It is not the time for blindfolding but for continuous monitoring of what is happening and for all Spaniards to know it in real time What we propose is ambitious but Spain has proven to be a leader in many things in medicine and we can be a leader in this too Therefore ladies and gentlemen we ask you to support this motion and not to be carried away by the flags but simply to think whether or not the proposal is good for the Spanish Press the green button the red one today is more than ever very despicable Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,11.719001,6.7472825,30,"mr. president come

#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen It is up to me to intervene to defend our proposal for a law on the reform of the procedure for granting nationality In his speech against Cayo Verres Cicero argued that the Roman civil formula sum I am a Roman citizen was to be a shield against arbitrariness at any point in the ancient world any point in the Mediterranean of the first century before Christ as Saint Paul could see when he was saved from the scourge to which he was about to be subjected by invoking his status as a Roman citizen President Kennedy in his famous speech to the Berlin Wall in 1963 held that the contemporary equivalent of Romanus sum civilians would be the phrase Ich bin ein Berliner I am a Berliner However these ancestors of ours knew very well that citizenship was a privilege and that therefore implied not only rights as we tend to believe today that we see citizenship as a kind of care worker but also duties In the case of Kennedy the counterpart of German honorary citizenship was the commitment to defend Berlin that islet of freedom in the communist ocean even with nuclear weapons In the case of Cicero the reverse of Roman civilians sum was that of dolce et decorum est pro patria mori that is there is a duty to defend the homeland even with life itself to defend this homeland that guarantees freedom In the debate that took place last week in the Madrid Assembly on the two deaths caused by the umpteenth street battle between Latin gangs Mrs. Díaz Ayuso said two things firstly she said that crime had nothing to do with the country of origin secondly she said that some of the members of those gangs were Spanish Well in relation to the first one it must be said that it is simply not true it is statistically unquestionable that foreigners residing in Spain commit crimes more frequently than Spaniards without this implying in any way that a majority of foreigners are criminals In particular resident foreigners account for 11.4 of the population and however 29 of the prison population from which a crime rate of about three times that of the Spanish population can be inferred This overrepresentation is even more pronounced in some groups for example the crime rate of Colombians is 4.3 times higher than that of Spaniards that of Moroccans is 4.1 times higher and that of Nigerians is 8.4 times higher If we move on to the most serious crimes which involve a sentence of more than five years then the disproportion is even more pronounced as can be seen in this graph That is men of American origin have a crime rate 10.6 times higher than Spaniards and men of African origin5 or 6 times higher The progress consensus tries to explain this over representation on the basis of poverty ignorance etc. but there was a time when the Spaniards were also poor and ignorant and yet we did not form gangs of murderers neither in Spain nor in the countries to which we emigrated Therefore the true explanation is cultural many of these immigrants come from the most violent countries in the world and the mentality of a person does not change by the art of magic by setting foot on Spanish land For example the homicide rate in El Salvador is 100 times higher than in Spain Of course they must not pay righteous for sinners as I said before Of course a majority of immigrants are not criminals but it is of particular interest to that honest majority that strict immigration controls be established that prevent their compatriots from entering Spain to defile the good name of their country of origin thus projecting an unjust collective suspicion on all The other thing Mrs. Ayuso said is that some of the Dominican Don't Play in this case are Spanish I guess I meant some of them have the Spanish DNI Well for us to be Spanish is much more than having a role Moreover such persons should never have obtained such a role We do not want criminals to be able to obtain Spanish nationality we do not want the savagery that only a month ago attacked with a baseball bat and then raped an octogenarian in Alicante could become Spanish one day we do not want the members of La Manada de Azuqueca who raped anally and vaginally in shifts at a 12 year old girl to ever be Spanish The reform we are proposing seeks to change the procedure for the award of Spanish nationality We think that the nation is not stamped paper we think that the nation is a moral community it is a historical project a suggestive historical project said Ortega and Gasset in invertebrate Spain it is a historical enterprise and therefore cannot be open to anyone The specific changes we include relate for example to the time limits for obtaining nationality by residence The ordinary term is extended from 10 to 15 years the reduced time limits for persons who have obtained refugee status we leave them equal in 5 years and also the reduced time limits for citizens of Ibero American Filipino Ecuadorian or Portuguese origin But we add new requirements such as for example for the acquisition of nationality by residence a certificate proving the lack of a criminal record both in the country of origin and in Spain and in the case of non-Hispano Americans an official language certificate proving their mastery of the Spanish language and also overcoming a test of knowledge of Spanish history the Constitution and culture We also add an assumption of loss of nationality by sanction for those who have dual nationality namely those who commit crimes or are sentenced to a final sentence for crimes against the Constitution public order independence from Spain or treason offences There are already districts in Madrid such as Usera which have up to 58 foreign residents The consensus progresses rejoices in this abundance of new Spaniards of the most diverse origins the consensus progress seems to not care if these new Spaniards share our culture our customs or even our language Last week my colleague Rocío de Meer held in this very rostrum that what it seems is to progressively turn nations into neutral containers devoid of identity and to be replenishable with people of any cultural origin and whoever dares to question this radiant multicultural future will automatically be mocked as racist Former Czech President Václav Klaus has said that pseudo religious worship of diversity as a value in itself is preventing rational debate on the migration issue so I recommend to the left wing gentlemen that they travel through this new multicultural Europe and will be able to check their failure I will read a quote that is not mine I open quotes The Arabs will never integrate into French society Integration is possible between Europeans because the cultural fabric is the same but here we are talking about another continent another religion they will be bad French they will never be French 100 percent I close quotes This is not said by Eric Zemmour or Jean Marie Le Pen this was said by King Hassan II of Morocco in an interview given to Anne Sinclair Some will say well integration will come over time No it 's not like that either integration does n't always come with time It has been found that the second or third generation of immigrants are often less integrated than their parents or grandparents it is a phenomenon to which Georges Bensoussan has referred as dissimilarity The French Muslims practice endogamy marry each other by 90 in sporting events they boocheaLa Marsellesa and vitore the anthems of Algeria or Morocco in terrorist attacks against Charlie Hebdo magazine or the Bataclan discotheque and others several of the perpetrators were second generation immigrants already born in France with the French passport there are areas of Paris such as Bradford or Malmö which already look more like the Maghreb than Europe areas where women no longer dare to go out alone or only go out with a male companion I recommend reading this book Prey by Ayaan Hirsi Ali which is one of the most interesting liberal intellectuals at the present time It is of Somali origin with which I imagine they will not call it white supremacist In this book it explains precisely how the migratory avalanche that has fallen on Europe over the last ten years has led to a deterioration in women 's security and an increase in sexual violence Women in many European cities already have to avoid certain neighborhoods and do not dare to run to the park or if they do it is with anti-rape sports clothing equipped with alarms in case of tearing The number of violations in Denmark increased by 102 between 2014 and 2017 coinciding with the arrival of the large avalanche of alleged Middle East refugees In the United Kingdom violations rose by 70 over the same period On New Year 's Eve 2015 the hundreds of alleged Middle East refugees who had recently arrived in Germany practiced in cities such as Cologne Düsseldorf etc. the taharrush gamemea that is sexual harassment in herd against hundreds of German youths however the matter was covered up both by the police and by the German press so as not to feed xenophobia And what is the reaction of consensus progress against all this Well to say that it's our fault that it 's the fault of the host society because we 're very racist and we 're not quite hospitable This is a simple suicide reaction Italian intellectual Renato Crispín has said that today 's Europe has two major diseases One of them is oicophobia that is hatred of one 's own origins hatred of one 's own roots and hatred of oneself and the other is xenophilia which is the acritic beatification of the stranger something that by the way Pope Benedict XVI also said in a quote I do n't have time to read We do n't think it 's our fault,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,16.753994,3.645194,30,good afternoon ladies gentlemen intervene defend proposal law reform procedure granting nationality speech

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much President For a moment I thought I was listening to the Australian Home Secretary talking about border security that there are no massive assaults that our agents are protected that there is nothing to fear You really can't have any more nerve when you come up to a rostrum But I will tell you once again Minister you suffer from deep political deafness But how dare you after I have manifested it twice here our president four and every spokesman who has intervened in any matter how dare you again bring out the stupidity the stupidity and the palmery lie that we applaud the invasion of Ukraine by Putin 's communist satrap But how dare you To be told is to the communist ministers of his Government who are trying to protect Putin To be told is to the Secretary of State of his 2030 Agenda which ruins farmers meets with Maduro and supports satraps dictators like Putin So stop making it up But you have a handheld which takes you there and it does n't matter what we talk about Take page one and start because the far right You 've said it five times Look if we are the far right you know well that we are not you are the ultra stupidity the high treason the ultra lie the ultra cynicism and of course several of your group and who support you the ultra communism and the ultra left Minister do you know what 's going on That there has been a time when that far right has applauded you when you have said the only truth in your whole speech copying us that the only legal immigration is the only good immigration the one that comes to the house knocking on the door the one that meets the legal requirements the one that does not hit the agents the one that does not assault the border the one that does not pull lime alive the one that has not been imposing its criterion by force That that legal immigration of course that 's the one we applaud the one that comes to generate wealth And by the way the only one who as a sovereign nation has the right to say when how many and who enter not the outside mafias who will tell us what immigration has to enter how much it has to enter and when it has to enter That is the difference between those who believe in the sovereign nation and the rule of law and those who are on their knees before the dictates of the globalists You have repeated to the satiety that you will not tolerate Look I 'd like to hear from you now when I come up that you publicly assume this commitment I 'm not going to tolerate Morocco any more collaboration with the assaults He wo n't get a euro or a million more if he allows the assaults again Secondly I am not going to tolerate another day without the entire Melilla fence having the 10 meters which is only 850 linear meters and I am going to build that useful necessary and waterproof fence Thirdly I will not tolerate another day when my National Police and Civil Guard officers are unprotected I 'm gonna give you the best stuff on the market in helmets vests vehicles I will not tolerate again that they are forbidden to use the anti-disturbing material they will be able to use tear gas they will be able to use rubber balls they will be able to use trucks throw water all the anti-disturbing material that is used around the world to contain the massive assaults I will not tolerate say it if you dare say it that not a single illegal immigrant who violently assaulted the border can stay in Spanish territory we speed up all legal procedures for him to be returned to his country of origin That 's what we want to hear from the Spaniards that 's what we want to hear from the agents and professionals who fight against the traffic mafias and the assaults But Minister if you do n't care what I can tell you you do n't care what I can explain to you Let 's see if you explain to the Spaniards whether carrying these sharp tipped iron forks that clave into our agents can be considered a legal and peaceful immigration Three thousand of these hooks have entered Spain,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,12.579569,9.201115,30,thank much president moment thought listening australian home secretary talking border security

#AgustínRosetyFernándezDeCastro,Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen in its recent inquiry the People 's Parliamentary Group asked the Government to comment on its position and strategy in relation to the war in Ukraine The Minister expressed strong support from the Executive for the country being attacked but works are love and not good reasons Ladies and gentlemen of the Government we have made a fool of ourselves over and over again with our aid shipments The Leopards have been loud because it has served among other things to demonstrate the disastrous state of our war reserves which is so jealously hidden That said the strategy what is said strategy does not appear in Mrs Robles answer Ladies and gentlemen of the PP you are very naive to expect such a pronouncement from the Frankenstein Government The strategy a word devalued by use and abuse has been defined as part of the dialectic of wills This will which comes from national sovereignty not NATO or the European Union is what characterizes the State as a strategic actor capable of asserting its interests before adversaries and also before partners and allies You know that the sovereignty security and prosperity of our compatriots are our interests In Spain and in Europe it is time for patriots Well how can a collective will be formed within an Executive only united by its partisan interest even personal ones How to serve the national interest when the nation itself is being denied at the same time How can we enforce our international commitments when a party of the government coalition calls the terrorist organization the alliance to which we belong Mr Santiago and Mr Pisarello were warned by our Member Mr Asarta clearly two weeks ago and I have reproached Mrs Maestro for this in the Commission more than once what they have been calling the Putin war is a widespread crisis The vital interests of the major strategic actors are committed to generating an unprecedented geopolitical economic and energy crisis and of course our own A general strategy of the Government would have to have ensured Spain 's energy supply making use of the advantage of good relations with Algeria but Mr. Álvarez or Mr. Sánchez or both of them at the helm were in charge of rolling it all out giving Western Sahara to Morocco Now our imports of Putin 's gas which is also Putin's in addition to the war have multiplied while illegal immigration is growing from Algeria and Morocco and the threat to Ceuta Melilla and the Canary Islands persists Is that strategy ladies and gentlemen of the progressive coalition But time is pressing and we must focus on the motion I am already advancing our inclination to vote in favour How can I not All its points sound good to a group that as VOX has condemned from the first moment the aggression of the Russian Federation to Ukraine However read more carefully we have felt that our compliance with points 2 3 and 6 must be nuanced so we have recorded the corresponding amendments It is proposed to include a specific item in the State General Budgets to finance the shipment of military equipment to Ukraine It seems right to us and we will vote in favour provided that it is specified that this item is not considered part of the defence effort or therefore the resources to be allocated to our Armed Forces are not considered to be part of the defence effort Point 3 calls on the Government to ensure a budget increase in defence to reach a minimum of 2 of GDP How many years ladies and gentlemen The horizon agreed in Wales ends in 2024 and the government with its agreement ladies and gentlemen of the PP has extended it until 2029 Do you really believe ladies and gentlemen of the left and right benches that the international situation and the state of prostration of our Armed Forces advise us to continue trying for luck With regard to point 6 this gives us some perplexity Ukraine 's accession to the European Union is today a desideratum paid for by the natural interest of that country 's government and by a certain flight ahead of the European Union plunged into endogenous and also external crises But ladies and gentlemen Ukraine is a war torn country in which none of our allies wish to intervene In the absence of an explicit NATO guarantee the proposal to speed up its accession to the European Union is a toast to the sun These are our amendments to those three points We will vote for them if they accept them Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,9.113661,3.7882295,30,thank mr. president ladies

#AlbertoAsartaCuevas,Thank you President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Russia 's invasion of Ukraine has highlighted and accelerated the decision of some border countries with the Russian Federation to apply for membership of the Atlantic Alliance This is the case in Sweden and Finland countries traditionally neutral but which in view of Putin 's threat to sovereignty and territorial integrity have decided to join the aforementioned defensive organisation Yes Mr. Rego defensive and not belligerent as you said last Tuesday I would remind you that according to the founding treaty any European State that is in a position to promote the development of the principles of the treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area can join NATO in short there are no vetoes in NATO Mr Pisarello look at the obsolete NATO military structure that was originally twelve countries and we will soon be thirty two many of them world renowned for their economic and social development as well as for their democratic level and we continue to grow Mr Pisarello According to the procedure we are at the moment when the current thirty members unanimously send the invitation letter to Sweden and Finland to start negotiations Of course we will be happy to admit them to the alliance as both countries meet the conditions and decide freely to belong to the organization Since its foundation NATO has proved to be a defensive and dissuasive tool Mr Iñarritu defensive and dissuasive necessary and decisive not only during the Cold War period but throughout the later period and even today Wide sectors of the left and above all the extreme Spanish left continue with their obsolete caspian and rancio speech this time Mr Pisarello rancio of the pacifist idealism of the rejection of weapons moving more in ideological arguments than in the real and pragmatic field of the strategic interests and security and defense of Spain Felipe González was aware of the importance of belonging to NATO when in 1986 he took a turn in his policy towards the alliance asking for the yes in the referendum on this instead of the electoral slogan of NATO of entry no Do you remember Some of us who are already old yes The referendum was in favour of our entry and necessary for entry into the European Economic Community today the European Union thus admitting that the initial rejection of the PSOE had been a mistake As you can see sometimes when it is rectified it is correct This shift to the left in Spanish foreign policy in relation to the alliance was controversial and controversial for Spanish society which was debated between the pacifist idealism of the rejection of arms and the important fear of being excluded from the group of more developed countries influential and powerful in the world arguments these last ones used by President González himself to request the yes in the referendum cited as advantages for the interests of Spain The debate continues today by the extreme left and other separatist groups as we have seen that with their slogans of NATO no bases out it seems as if they do not realize what is happening in the heart of Europe and that that could happen to us to any other European country Now more than ever we would have to apply the fact that union is a force and therefore the more we are the more difficult it will be to invade one Member State by another invader and aggressor as has been the case Ladies and gentlemen days before the Madrid Summit Mr De Santiago who is here former Secretary of State and Secretary General of the Communist Party of Spain made a public statement together with other members of the Executive against NATO This is the last of a series of actions that Unidad Podemos has been carrying out against one of the bulwarks and cornerstones of Spain 's security scheme These manifestations of a prominent member of the partner party of the current Spanish Government have their consequences on foreign policy and in the VOX Parliamentary Group we express our absolute rejection of the erratic foreign policy of the Government It would be good if at least in State policies they agreed otherwise they would continue to be ridiculous and causing damage to Spain 's image abroad However and despite showing our infinite distance to this government of which you are a part the United We Can we unlike you do believe in the unity of Spain and its policies of state in this case the one relating to national security because we consider that the national interest is above any partisan struggle That you the Communists catalogue the Atlantic Alliance as a terrorist organization Mr Garzón Minister of Consumer Affairs and other Members of Parliament have expressed it in this Congress during this parliamentary term at least it wants bold and offensive no longer for the declaration itself that it is but because you are defenders of a totalitarian anti-democratic and genocidal ideology which carries millions of innocent deaths behind your back As good communists you know no loyalty beyond your party Therefore I cannot ask you for it from institutions that you reject but I do appeal to the Government of Spain to put order and coherence within its ranks because the damage caused by these demonstrations is enormous With the current mix of socialists communists and separatists who make up the worst government directly or indirectly at the worst possible time it will be complicated but we do not want to lose hope Membership of NATO represents many advantages for its members and for this reason it is increasingly the European countries and some members of the former Soviet Union who earnestly wish to join the alliance but it also represents a series of commitments that must be fulfilled As you well know the main advantage and it is also a fundamental commitment is in article 5 of the treaty whereby member countries undertake to respond militarily to an attack on one of their members And among the commitments in addition to the above members undertake to participate as far as possible in the common budget which after the war in Ukraine as you know has increased and which the Government of Spain at the last Summit in Madrid has already committed itself to gradually rising to 2 of GDP We will see that and we will also see who is responsible for doing so because it seems that the current government has the days counted until the next elections,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,8.372234,7.030367,30,thank president good morning ladies

#RivoltaErica,Mr President compared to the Update Note to the Document of Economics and Finance NADEF of 2021 with the financial forecasts we have seen a sharp deterioration in the update At first the country experienced the great pandemic crisis which had devastating effects on health but also on the economy and therefore on the lives of businesses and families There have also been damage to the perception of life so we have seen a suffering that has left deep signs because most people had never experienced such a dramatic moment made of renunciation fear many times also induced by a climate of terror let me say it In this regard I would like to hope that as in other European countries even in Italy against the omicron variant we will not arrive at a further closure because our country our entrepreneurs our families could not overcome this moment therefore I really hope that we will adapt to other countries and not repeat the closures This picture of suffering and difficulty at a time when thanks to the precise actions of the Government there was also a substantial recovery therefore an atmosphere of optimism it was certainly mentioned the whole theme of bonuses and superbonus which have accelerated the recovery we have fallen to the head this obsession of war with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia This is also an unexpected fact absolutely new and I must say that on this dramatic issue too I fear that information which must always be free will create an atmosphere of distress from morning to evening Maybe we do n't need to watch the war for 24 hours a day All wars are horrible and bring suffering but I think it would be more important for people to have less exposure to this bombardment In any case this is our situation We found ourselves dismayed as suddenly attacked on several fronts surely for a long time before we found ourselves attacked from the point of view of raw materials Already last year we were asking the question of the scarcity of raw materials which put in difficulty the companies that transformed and evidently caused an increase in prices Since last year there has been difficulty in finding steel already last year there was difficulty in finding plastic and wood so companies have found themselves having to stop this change and live with it The war further exploded this situation with an additional increase in energy costs As some colleagues have already pointed out it is necessary to reflect on the ecological transition which we all want is clear but I think we can say that at the moment we must have more plans one in the short one in the medium and one in the long term and certainly if in the long term we can think of alternatives in the short term we must make ourselves independent not only from Russian gas but absolutely we must use the resources that exist also in our country and that we have decided not to use If conditions have changed perhaps we must also change our approach which does not mean that we do not disown a medium and long term trend but it means saving our accounts and having less difficulty in finding natural gas for example We must undoubtedly discuss this otherwise it becomes a boomerang Why hurt us Not at all We really use common sense There are also other considerations that I want to make and concern the difficulties as everyone has already said of businesses and families I remember that one of the first measures taken under the 2019 Budget Act was that of the 400 million for municipalities for the safety of roads schools public buildings and so on That was the first expansive maneuver to give the municipalities the opportunity to provide with necessary works for the population The bonuses gave an additional input but in the municipalities we find ourselves unable to go ahead with the works because there was an indiscriminate increase in raw materials an increase certainly there may be but what happened also concerned voices that nothing has to do with a real increase and this is an exclusively speculative fact We must then take action on this too It is not possible to agree to see the work and the construction sites blocked with the budgets of the municipalities in difficulty and doing nothing There are dozens and dozens of implementing decrees that must be carried out and that are firm on which depends the proper functioning of municipalities businesses and families As local administrator I sometimes think that for the valiant who are in the Ministries for charity people undoubtedly of great value and competence some internships should be foreseen in the simple and humble Municipalities where life really takes place with citizens asking for short term answers The roads in fact have to be fixed Maybe the ceiling of a school suddenly shows cracks and you have to give answers quickly In this sense too therefore I think that there must be a meeting point between the activities of the Ministries between those who then have to lay down the implementing decrees and what must happen downstream in the Municipalities There is also another problem however that in the municipalities they find themselves having to stem it is the demand on the part of people the families of traders and businesses to have a simpler life there is an incredible social discomfort that is growing In the budget law and in other measures we have allocated strong resources to support psychological distress We have them for schools for women and so on We 've done a lot but that 's not enough It is not enough because we must treat society in the most serious way for there to be aggregation for there to be social peace for a moment of difficulty to be overcome all together We must think of a new humanism which starts with people who even in difficulty are willing not to break everything but to roll up their sleeves because there is a program But it must be a program from all over the country you can think of working of better crossing the demand with the supply which unfortunately with the income of citizenship has not been done The first part has been completed that of assistance but not that of job search and overcoming the difficulty We must try to bring these realities together A new country with a different perspective beyond the war can only be born if the family is re-founded which still remains the fundamental nucleus but must be put in the conditions to grow together to make everyone grow The same goes for the enterprise which must certainly think of the realization of the entrepreneur but also of the work the development and the realization of the workers It is a new country that we must have in mind Otherwise if this social cohesion and progress do not take place I fear that the gap will open up more and more and we will not really be able to think of a balanced and constructive development of our country We must move towards a new humanism I hope that many of you will be able to share and help this process for what we can do in this House And I think it may not be that small,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,15.666331,-1.6820488,30,mr president compared

#CalandriniNicola,Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President first of all we want to announce as the Brothers of Italy Group the vote in favour of this bill to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the death of Giacomo Matteotti who will fall on 10 June 2024 When he was killed Matteotti was only thirty nine years old but behind him already had a long political commitment started over twenty years before and lived surely with courage and passion which had earned him the nickname of Tempesta In fact he had very often taken uncomfortable and difficult positions During the First World War he expressed himself so strongly against Italy 's participation in the conflict that he was sentenced to the border in Sicily from 1916 to 1918 Back in political activity since 1919 he has been among the hardest opponents of fascism of which he often denounced violent actions In 1920 and 1921 as part of the Italian Socialist Party he opposed the communist faction which had not yet given birth to a party on its own In 1922 a few days before the march on Rome he was expelled from the party together with Filippo Turati Giuseppe Modigliani Claudio Treves and others all accused by the maximalists of breaking the principle of non-cooperation with the so called bourgeois parties for having participated in the consultations of the king for the formation of the new government The expulsions founded the United Socialist Party of which Matteotti became national secretary Elected in 1919 and 1921 it was also elected in the April 1924 elections with the new electoral law that awarded a majority prize to the list that was the most voted on provided it exceeded 25 of the valid votes The results published by the Ministry of the Interior attributed 60 percent of the votes to the national list led by Benito Mussolini which included not only fascist candidates but also several liberals such as Orlando Salandra former popular Catholic and many others On May 30 Giacomo Matteotti intervened in the Chamber of Deputies stating that no Italian elector had found himself free to decide with his will because of the intimidation of the fascist militias during the stage of presentation of the lists during the electoral campaign and also in the seats As a result he stated that it was doubtful whether the national list had obtained that 25 percent necessary for the majority prize and therefore the election of his candidates should not be validated Eleven days later on the 10th of June the day on which his new intervention was expected in the Chamber which had left his home on the lungotevere he was forcibly loaded into a car by a team of five men part of a secret fascist group linked to the Viminal who had chosen the name of Ceka that is that of the Soviet political police According to the reconstructions Matteotti continued to defend himself with great vigor trying to get rid of himself and one of the kidnappers fatally struck him with a dagger The five ended up burying the body briefly not far from Rome where it was found casually two months later Amerigo Dumini who was in charge of the team was arrested two weeks later From a political point of view the affair put Prime Minister Mussolini in great difficulty for months who was referred to by many as the principal who came out of it with the address to the House of 3 January 1925 in which he stated that he assumed every responsibility for what had happened From the judicial point of view in 1926 Dumini and two other men on the team were sentenced to four years three of which were cancelled by an amnesty for preterintentional murder In 1947 a new trial was held in which Dumini was sentenced to life imprisonment for premeditated murder Six years later however he was released by virtue of the amnesty promoted and wanted by Palmiro Togliatti head of the Communist Party The teaching that must be drawn from the figure and the story of Giacomo Matteotti apart from the refusal and condemnation of violence in the political confrontation wherever it comes from and the importance of respect for democratic rules which we believe to be obvious but which is always good to reiterate is that of always defending the right which for a parliamentarians for a political exponent is also a duty of denouncing the distortions and criticizing what is thought to endanger the institutions in that case the regularity of the elections of expressing their own beliefs on what is the good of the nation and its institutions and of criticizing facts and people who are believed to oppose them We hope that all this will emerge in studying and celebrating the figure of Giacomo Matteotti on the centenary of his death I would like to conclude by quoting a sentence from James Matteotti's dramatic speech of May 30 1924 To the President of the House who invited him to continue his speech despite the interruptions of many opponents but to do so prudently he replied I ask to speak not prudently nor imprudently but verbally Here the parliamentarians must always speak as such expressing their beliefs about what is the interest of the nation and its fellow citizens This is our right and even more our duty which Matteotti has impersonated to the extreme consequences For these reasons I repeat the vote in favour of the parliamentary group Fratelli d'Italia,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#ArrigoniPaolo,Mr President ladies and gentlemen the report is the result of intensive work by the Copasir during 2021 thanks to the relations between the Committee and the Republic 's Security Information System and the close hearings with all the ministers of the Interministerial Security Committee of the Republic CISR the Delegated Authority represented here by Prefect Gabrielli and the directors of the Security Information Department DIS the Information and External Security Agency AISE the Internal Security and Information Agency AISI and the new Cybersecurity Agency an intensive and articulated activity has developed The issues dealt with in the report show that the perimeter of control entrusted to the Copasir invests an increasingly extensive and neuralgic area which has what purpose the national security in its different declinations that cannot be considered static and predefined One of the main focus of Copasir 's activity as in previous years was the theme of 5G the single network and the national cloud which our country is still lacking There is an awareness that the strategic and now indispensable role of the most advanced telecommunications networks as well as of the new generation of infrastructures demands a constant defence against pitfalls and threats that risk exposing these garrisons to an accentuated vulnerability This awareness combined with the Committee 's constant drive led in June last year although with many years of delay to the establishment of the National Cybersecurity Agency which is allowing our country to reduce a gap that is no longer sustainable in this sensitive sector a key agency also to respond to the hybrid character of the Russian war against Ukraine Moreover the extremely invasive extent of cyber threats the plurality of possible sources of aggression and undue interference the same heterogeneity of attacks and possible incidents are all together factors of extreme concern which require a protective and maximum resilience framework which requires continual adaptation and refinement To this end we recall that 95 of Italian public administrations do not yet have the necessary and adequate tools to protect their data Thousands of public administrations still have Russian Kaspersky as antivirus There is therefore a need to use European technology to build a national strategic hub which will host country 's strategic digital data and services together with the National Cybersecurity Agency in order to ensure maximum protection of national security The government 's exercise of special powers the so called golden power has also been systematically monitored in the course of the Committee 's work which has identified its limitations as well as its scope for improvement The already fragile economic situation has also been affected by the explosion of the pandemic with a general reduction in productivity and competitiveness and a devaluation of strategic industrial assets increasingly exposed to foreign aims It has been found that in a more dangerous condition are the small Italian multinationals that develop artificial intelligence robotics packaging machine tools defense and biotechnology Hence the need for a geopolitical protection and so called special powers or golden power a legal instrument for the protection of economic financial industrial and scientific interests at the disposal of the Italian Government With this discipline modified during the pandemic to increase the role of intelligence services our country builds or wants to do so its identity presenting before the global world its priorities in order to ensure the maintenance of a leading role for Italy and its degree of overall competitiveness within the global area It is in this sense that a modern and truly incisive vision of the culture of security can no longer ignore the so called economic intelligence as they have been doing for several years in France the defence of the independence of the state and the national territory requires that the perimeter of security includes the protection of strategic economic interests and crucial for the strength of our country The Committee has also launched a survey on aerospace as a new frontier of geopolitical competition deepening the current process of liberalisation affecting the space perimeter and its consequences starting from the adaptation of international regulations in the field and the increasing protagonism of private actors alongside state actors among which are powers particularly active in the exploitation of space domain A further survey of the prospects for developing the common European defence and cooperation between intelligence services is also under way The Committee will come to Brussels in two weeks time One of the issues to consider is the strengthening of the national defence industry as a strategic asset for the country system both because it provides capacities and means indispensable for the protection of national interest and because it is a resource to increase the geopolitical influence of Italy I think it is a good thing that in the light of the Russian Ukrainian war there have been more arguments about the possibility of devoting more resources to defence in the state budget Of course the Copasir could not fail to dedicate a chapter to the country 's energy system Already in the second half of 2020 a year before the emergence of expensive energy the second half of last year it was clear to the members of the Committee the need to carry out a cognitive survey to analyze the vulnerability of our system characterized by a high dependence on energy and raw materials from abroad also due to the unfortunate and progressive reduction of the exploitation of national geo-resources Our dependence on gas from abroad last year was 96 percent due to the lack of diversification of supplies In fact we import 40 of gas from Russia We are critical in the safety of the energy system and strategic reserves a high cost of electricity and gas bills historically higher than European partners and risks of impact of the ecological transition Meanwhile since the second half of 2021 but for those who speak to you it was expected the perfect storm with the dear energy that has touched Europe in particular Italy with more structural characteristics than cyclical expensive energy then aggravated with the Russian Ukrainian crisis to become the worst energy crisis in recent decades also in the face of the concrete danger that Russia can exploit this issue to exert pressure on the EU using gas supplies as an instrument of tension and asymmetrical war With regard to energy security in the current phase of ecological transition the information procedure has shown that the complex changes caused by climate change and the fight against global warming with the aim of achieving so called climate neutrality by 2050 have given impetus to a phase of energy transition full of opportunities but also of serious risks which are much greater and diversified than those related to the renewal of hydroelectric concessions which I see emphasized by many colleagues as the only problem of our energy system With this in mind the need for a strengthening of so called economic intelligence in support of such a decisive sector is further stressed through an approach not only more defensive and protective but also proactive and proactive Mr President I would ask you to be able to hand over the final part of the speech to the record and I come to the conclusion that the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group thanks President Urso who is the rapporteur today and above all expresses his sincere thanks to the women and men of the agencies

#PepePasquale,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen in the meantime I think I share a wish shared by the whole of this House namely that the positive signals coming from Turkey from last night can become concrete and definitive signs of peace as soon as possible I would like to make some comments on the decree law that we are about to approve The measure in fact does not only deal with weapons but also with other weapons Some Members mentioned earlier that it is about the reception of refugees the decree law has allocated important sums but we all know that we will need more to ensure reception health care and services for these women and these children who really flee from the war In this context I take the opportunity to say although I know that our parent Massimiliano Romeo together with other colleagues is already moving in this direction that it is right and proper to move in time so as not to burden all this situation on the Italian municipalities both from the economic and logistic point of view and services It is important that the system be set up immediately that coordination be carried out so that the service can be best served so that the Italian citizens cannot be indirectly welcomed by the people we all want and we must offer them The numbers to date are as follows 74,000 refugees in Italy of which 29,000 are minors So on the one hand there is the attention of the State on the other the great heart of Italy has emerged The Italians have all mobilized themselves individually and associated to welcome these people but also to bring to the borders with the lands of conflict basic necessities Another important measure the operation and security of the offices that Italy has abroad of the staff that Italy has abroad but also of the interests that Italy cultivates in the countries that can be most affected by this conflict It means protecting our women and our men who proudly represent the country abroad On everyone I want to remember our ambassador Zazo who was a hero of modern time a hero who saved 100 people a hero who kept open the only embassy seat in Ukraine ours the one with the tricolor There are measures that concern university students university teachers companies that are suffering from this conflict Then there is also the provision that provides for the disposal of military equipment equipment and equipment free of charge not lethal It is a necessary measure a measure that does not declare war a measure that was indispensable On the other hand we are talking about peace We want peace true peace not that which appeals to pacifism True peace where peoples love each other and live together very well But it must also be said as Mr Candura said very well before that there is a state that has attacked and a state that has been attacked How do you get peace If Russia stops or Ukraine stops The message is clear Let us be clear because we all know this and above all all our fellow citizens can know it in the right way and in the right direction The only way to achieve peace is for Russia to stop If Russia stops peace is achieved and war ends if Ukraine stops Ukraine ends it disappears from the map The only way to achieve peace is that during the time that diplomacy is at work Ukraine can defend itself and can limit the offense that Russia is unjustly causing it This is a fact if Russia stops the war ends if Ukraine stops Ukraine ends Let 's be clear otherwise we do n't understand each other and fall into the misunderstanding It is a difficult time this we are living an extraordinarily difficult time We 've had two years of pandemics and now we have this conflict We have companies in difficulty families in difficulty We are touching problems that we would never have imagined until recently And if it is an extraordinary and difficult time we need an extraordinary commitment on the one hand and we need the unity of the country on the other hand An extraordinary commitment does not mean trenching behind labels and behind slogans We know the country is on its knees but we have to work to get the country up An extraordinary commitment means at the same time respecting international agreements because it is the result of the credibility and authority of our country but it also means supporting families and businesses We will begin immediately from the decree cuts prices but we will continue with the next measures with the next financial and also with the admission of further deviations Let 's not shout at the scandal We have families on their knees We can help them We have companies in difficulty we have to help them Above all we do not accept lessons from those who have been the author by political will of waste par excellence We can talk about the scooters that invade our sidewalks of the wheelchairs of the masks of Arcuri but also of the income of citizenship that so much waste and so many scams has provoked Mr President I shall end with unity The unity is required by President Mattarella who must be our lighthouse always and not if necessary A unity cannot be betrayed for a different political vision at this time because if we are in the majority it is in the spirit of sacrifice and service to Italy Even less so the unit must not be betrayed just to chase the polls This would be a very serious mistake I will really finish Mr President If we are aware that we live in an extraordinary time and that our honor is the Armed Forces let us all rise to their level and rank This means work a sense of responsibility a sense of the institutions and a few words Especially during this period words weigh like stones and if we use the right words and tones we can help the path of peace in the shortest possible time",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#LaRussaIgnazio,"THE RUSSIAN FdI Mr President to commemorate a Member of Parliament a President of the European Parliament who has known and appreciated himself always gives a strong emotion an emotion that the whole House shares today Sassoli rather than an exponent of a political part was in fact a figure that we have always recognized as a man of the institutions He was a journalist on the main television network and he had been in his youth In common with him I found a figure it was also scout And perhaps it has affected his youthful militancy in his way of working and acting What was his way what we political opponents have always recognized and that made us appreciate it Being a man without prejudice strong in his ideas but loyal and able to confront and discuss with everyone to recognize the one who did not think like him as an opponent with whom to be able to confront It was a characteristic of him who accompanied him and made him a President of the European Parliament capable of giving voice to the various pressures needs dynamics such complex ones as those of a Parliament that gathers people from all over the world His line was a clear one a Europeanist political line a political line of tolerance of overcoming all diversity We have appreciated it sometimes opposed it but always recognized as an honest man and it is not little in today 's time and as a loyal man and even more in today 's time it is not so simple and so common Like everyone else when they see a danger approaching and even his illness lived it without us noticing it at least the vast majority of us he may have rethinked his political life which began in 2009 with 400,000 votes of preference I say this to this House which has long forgotten for reasons of law what it means to collect votes of preference He had 400,000 votes preferably in 2009 but then his ambition at a certain point was to try to be mayor of his city of adoption Rome He could n't do it there He took half of Marino 's vows but he did n't make it a drama There too his ability to deal with a problem without making a fuss or boasting about it Then in his election as President of the European Parliament he was able to distinguish himself at the time of the pandemic not to close but rather to prevent any real impediment to European parliamentary activity A man who has been able to give the role that covered a thickness such as politics would always need to have I believe that he is an example for those who have militated in his political part but allow me even for those who did not have his own ideas for those who were a political opponent but in him he is reflected in loyalty tolerance in the ability to face the adversaries with a smile humility and firmness Thank you David",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,6.529328,3.3384402,30,"russian fdi mr president commemorate member parliament president european parliament known appreciated always gives strong emotion emotion whole house shares today sassoli rather exponent political part fact figure always recognized man institutions journalist main television network youth common found figure also scout perhaps affected youthful militancy way working acting way political opponents always recognized made us appreciate man without prejudice strong ideas loyal able confront discuss everyone recognize one think like opponent able confront characteristic accompanied made president european parliament capable giving voice various pressures needs dynamics complex ones parliament gathers people world line clear one europeanist political line political line tolerance overcoming diversity appreciated sometimes opposed always recognized honest man little today 's time loyal man even today 's time simple common like everyone else see danger approaching even illness lived without us noticing least vast majority us may rethinked political life began 2009 400,000 votes preference say house long forgotten reasons law means collect votes preference 400,000 votes preferably 2009 ambition certain point try mayor city adoption rome could n't took half marino 's vows n't make drama ability deal problem without making fuss boasting election president european parliament able distinguish time pandemic close rather prevent real impediment european parliamentary activity man able give role covered thickness politics would always need believe example militated political part allow even ideas political opponent reflected loyalty tolerance ability face adversaries smile humility firmness thank david"
#LaRussaIgnazio,THE RUSSIAN FdI Mr President in Office of the Council I would like to say at once that I appreciated your report for a patriotic opposition force it is not the first time but it is significant that in this case the Brothers of Italy have full support for the joint initiative of the whole Parliament and the whole nation in support of the Ukrainian people and their good reasons without whether or not That is why my thoughts go immediately to those who are fighting in Ukraine to the Ukrainian Armed Forces who have not surrendered and as my friend Adolfo Urso said before to the girls who are preparing with bottles of beer Molotov to the workers who contribute to tear down bridges and viaducts and dig trenches to families with children in the cellars and improvised shelters because no one thought it was so urgent to imagine in Kiev the existence of shelters A conscious thought of the turning point that this story represents for the world there is a first and there is a following Russia 's aggression against Ukraine We are faced with the need no longer to remove what we have removed for too long namely that war is not an impossible thing that multicolored flags are not enough that unilateral peace is not enough and less unilateral pacifism and that every day we must build peace knowing that war can exist It 's the only way to be prepared Today after Putin 's incredible act of Russia we have a much wider solidarity than we could have expected Putin's Russia probably did not expect a Ukrainian resistance to what was imagined as a lightning war such as I use a sad term the blitzkrieg He probably thought that as in Crimea we would find ourselves faced with the accomplished fact and then the reactions would be more disordered and less convinced It has not been so and this error allows us fortunately to think of how concretely to react with solidarity I said it a moment ago without if and without but and also with concrete aid for the needs of material survival but also military aid with defensive weapons that even yesterday in the encounter I had with the Ukrainian consul of Lombardy we were asked starting from the bulletproof vests and helmets extremely defensive elements which they tell us are the most urgent that Ukraine needs Concrete aid of course but also sanctions For once Biden who has some responsibility if only for encouraging with the shameful retreat in Afghanistan terrible actions like this he said the right thing sanctions are necessary because the alternative would be World War III We must be prepared to adopt sanctions which will also be a damage to us our families and our nation knowing that the government we give it a mandate will ensure that they are always fair and will not fall on one nation more than on another We also need to help Ukraine with different reception rules and not to change immigration policy which should be changed in the opposite direction In this case in the face of a real war and real reasons for a European people to flee from that terrible situation we call for all the necessary measures to be taken to abolish the bureaucratic mechanisms that could slow the arrival of those who want to come here to shelter themselves from the war and to work welcomed by friends There is no doubt that the consequences of this act will not only be political and diplomatic and will put us before a reality that we had removed but will also be economic and geopolitical You have already been reminded and I am grateful to you Mr Draghi of the absence of a national energy plan This is not the time to say 've we said 've nor to claim anything in front of those who given the need for a national energy plan always felt that it was a question of freedom and independence I am glad that at last it becomes a common feeling but we need to move on from words to deeds In fact there is no freedom and independence without energy independence Having abdicated our energy independence and put our needs in the hands of others no matter whether Putin or anyone else is something that needs to be rethought immediately even by reopening the debate on nuclear power I remember that the French nuclear power stations are on the border with our country and we would therefore suffer the possible negative consequences but never enjoy the positive ones I do not give the solution but I say that the matter needs to be re-examined I raise this issue which has been ignored I imagine deliberately in the first part of the debate although I do not have the sure answer As I said it is about our freedom and there will be repercussions in Italy but also in Europe I have heard for the first time in a convincing way of common defense Again I do not want to make demands on those who have always believed that thought should go to a confederated Europe with its firm point in defence international diplomatic policy and the defence of common energies rather than looking perhaps at the colours for food that have penalized Italy too many times This is the Europe we expect and want We want to move towards a European confederation that can defend the values of freedom democracy and independence of the peoples united by a common feeling and a history that has united them for good and evil In announcing the vote in favour of the joint motion that we have contributed to writing I say that nothing like the difficulties crises and tragedies can have as a side effect the strengthening of the common roots the awakening of the values that are sowed that make a people a nation and that unite the nations daughters of the same values historical and religious I believe that this awareness must guide us in the tragedy of Russian aggression making us say to one voice that

#LaRussaIgnazio,Mr President after me Senator Fazzolari will explain more widely the position of Brothers of Italy I would just like to point out that in these days even in the press and in the course of television broadcasts the political party leaders are asking themselves an imperfect question asking whether we are pro-Russian or in favour of something else For Brothers of Italy the answer is very simple we are neither philorusians nor philokinesis nor philo Arabic If you really want to apply the concept of the thread which as Giorgia Meloni says belongs more to puppets than to political forces we are pro-Italian At this stage this means being without and without but in a position of accession to NATO and to the Western bloc There 's no argument about that However being led to safeguard Italian interests also means examining not only the position of today for which as the Minister has said with whom I agree we are certainly for the defence at all costs of the territorial and political integrity of the European States Ukraine at the head at this time We are also interested in understanding why we have come to this point I remember the story of not many years ago as far as Putin 's relationship with Italy is concerned of political friendship and not just personal friendship with Berlusconi which is known and on which it is useless to return But I remember George Bush 's America had a completely different relationship with Putin at the time so much so that we could then imagine that Russia could enter NATO and we forgot it while now in order not to have NATO on the border Putin is almost willing to declare a terrible war I am a convinced Atlanticist but the mistakes of some American administrations especially those of Obama and Biden must be strongly emphasized because they have dramatized the confrontation with Russia having facilitated and pushed Ukraine to the request to enter NATO Many years ago I was Minister of Defence and I remember that at the NATO meetings that I attended I expressed strong doubts about the action that had already begun to approach Ukraine or rather to promote Ukraine 's rapprochement with NATO until it got there It was clear that the advantages were much less than the dangers that this could have brought in relations with Russia Then there is the problem of the role that we have always raised This was well done by Senator Nencini perhaps mindful of his party 's main exponent Craxi who knew how to give meaning to the national identity Perhaps he was the first sovereignist of Italy Craxi for that famous story of which it is useless to remember the contours in which in front of the arrival of the American troops and planes put the carabinieri around the airport I wonder however why the European Union today cannot imagine a path which we have long hoped for aimed at giving itself a political role rather than a role exquisitely aimed at giving some form of different pressure to the national states on other matters We would like the European Union to focus on a common military policy a common foreign policy and a common fiscal line and then leave more freedom to individual nations On the other hand this time too we see the total absence of a diplomatic and geopolitical strategy for the European Union For us who are more pro-European than those who are pro-European in substance moments like this demonstrate the need for the European Union to evolve walk and go in a very different direction from the one it has followed so far I believe that I have run out of time and therefore remaining on the subject today on the agenda I repeat that if I look at the future of our nation and therefore of our children I see I imagine I hope and I want an Italy strongly linked to the Western world which knows how to hold to the values of freedom democracy and independence that someone would rather be implied,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,8.903793,-0.46822008,30,mr president

#CirianiLuca,Mr President President Draghi Members of the Senate Members of the Government what has happened in these hours and is still taking place in Ukraine for the direct and precise responsibility of Putin 's Russia is undoubtedly very serious Suddenly we feel like we 're living a nightmare We are facing a dramatic crossroads of history with scenes that we thought delivered forever to our past History places us in front of a crossroads and a brutal acceleration really dramatic because it sweeps away in a single moment the illusions of those who after the logic of the blockades after the cold war after the fall of the Berlin Wall had imagined that history would have a linear path the triumphal march of democracies freedom and rights It was n't like that and it 's not like that Democracy is falling behind and it is our duty to defend it in every corner of the world This crossroads however Mr President ladies and gentlemen also sweeps away the theories of those who in recent years thought that the world the planet and the great geopolitical issues could only be regulated by business the market or by good feelings turning their eyes to another side so as not to see reality as it is or the theories of those who explained that there could be free unarmed states while once again history teaches that States are based on numbers strength and even armies without which the innocent are the first to succumb President Draghi today here in the Senate also for the Brothers of Italy Group for our President Giorgia Meloni is first of all the day of sorrow for the civilian victims for the military victims and for the suffering inflicted on the population And it is also the day for us especially for us if you will allow us of the tribute to the Ukrainian patriots who are fighting alone a desperate war They 're fighting alone a desperate war Politically however for us this day in the Senate as well as in the House is the day of responsibility decisions and unity of the unity of our country of the unity of the European Union I would like to say of the unity of the whole free world These are duties which we as a group certainly do not want to escape We have however Mr President the need to say not today because this day is dedicated to something else that the time will soon come to deal with our mistakes and our faults Mistakes and faults in fact there have been and it is useless to deny it as it is useless to hide the dust under the carpet I want to refer to the failure of our national and international diplomatic action to Biden 's failure in American foreign policy to the hasty and shameful withdrawal six months ago from Afghanistan with NATO allies alerted a few days or a few hours earlier to the role NATO wants or can play at this moment which we have not yet understood and finally I want to refer to the fact that there is no European Union that carries out an understandable and perceptible military activity The European Union militarily does not exist simply I want to make a single reference instead to our domestic policy to the issues that concern our country and I have to do so right now because you did too President Draghi Italy 's energy policy in recent years has simply been reckless We have assigned and entrusted the energy supplies of a G7 country the second European manufacture to politically dangerous countries and at the best of politically unstable cases We have given up a national energy security plan to pursue political correctness to pursue ideological environmentalism In other words we have entrusted the security of our country and our businesses to those who live politics as if they were Alice in Wonderland But today I repeat once again is not the day for these discussions which we will soon have to do Today it is a day for us for our Group for our political strength to reaffirm so that it is clear and there are no shadows that those who unilaterally decide to attack with arms in hand a neighbouring country immediately and automatically put themselves on the side of the wrong and that there are no reasons of political character geopolitical character historical character pseudo historical character recent reasons or past to justify a war of aggression President and colleagues the Brothers of Italy Group represents the only opposition in this House but we have always defined our national patriotic and absolutely responsible opposition We will be as a force of opposition at the side of the Italian European and international government institutions at this epochal moment for the simple reason that it would be impossible as well as wrong to choose not to take sides I happened to read yesterday a speech by Angela Merkel spoken I believe to the European Parliament two years ago during a serious crisis like this perhaps more serious I do not know we will see it that is the pandemic crisis These are words that can be perfectly adapted to today 's crisis The Chancellor said on that occasion that Europe is not such if we do not support each other when an emergency of which no one is guilty strikes us Referring to that crisis he added that we also have the task of showing who we want to be like Europe I want to remind you that there can be no children and stepchildren even in the management and consequences of this crisis and because I have also found it out of place on the part of Senator Renzi the continuous polemical postponement at these moments to the positions taken by courageous states such as the Polish one which have tried on their skin

#MalanLucio,"Mr Malan FdI Mr President the Brothers of Italy Group joins the commemoration of Enrico Berlinguer in the hundred years since his birth Enrico Berlinguer in the twelve years in which he was political secretary of the Italian Communist Party undoubtedly led his party which was for the first forty years of the Republic the second party in Italy from a position that was closely linked to Moscow even in the first years of his secretariat to an increasingly autonomous position to affirming that Italy needed the umbrella of NATO an extraordinary evolution in this relatively short period of time Enrico Berlinguer has gone beyond the usual patterns of his party and its part not only in this extremely important evolution of the international position of the Communist Party but also in other respects As well as in truth his predecessors he fully accepted the rules of democracy even at a time when the bond with the Soviet Union which was certainly not democratic was very strong It was as has been said a man of dialogue so much to meet and this was particularly difficult at the time Giorgio Almirante who was the leader of the Right a courageous act that was followed by the presence of Almirante himself at the funeral of Enrico Berlinguer We commemorate this man who has certainly been among the most important political figures of the post war period knowing well that on many issues we have been and are very far from him but the approach that we believe is correct in relation to the characters and historical events is precisely the opposite of cancel culture that is to pretend that events of decades ago conform to the current standards and to judge with an extremely biased spirit Clearly his is a figure who is very far from us from the political point of view but it is due to respect for a political leader who guided with great dignity an extremely important political force in our nation and who collected millions of votes during the elections as has been recalled in 1976 he exceeded even 12 million votes but remained the second party Just six days after his sudden disappearance which took place on 11 June 1984 the Communist Party became the first party in Italy in the European elections overcoming for the first time the Christian Democracy even if by a little more than 100,000 votes Well in front of those who represented so many Italian citizens respect is due so we join his memory in this commemoration",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,6.5486546,-0.018919118,30,"mr malan fdi mr president brothers italy group joins commemoration enrico berlinguer hundred years since birth enrico berlinguer twelve years political secretary italian communist party undoubtedly led party first forty years republic second party italy position closely linked moscow even first years secretariat increasingly autonomous position affirming italy needed umbrella nato extraordinary evolution relatively short period time enrico berlinguer gone beyond usual patterns party part extremely important evolution international position communist party also respects well truth predecessors fully accepted rules democracy even time bond soviet union certainly democratic strong said man dialogue much meet particularly difficult time giorgio almirante leader right courageous act followed presence almirante funeral enrico berlinguer commemorate man certainly among important political figures post war period knowing well many issues far approach believe correct relation characters historical events precisely opposite cancel culture pretend events decades ago conform current standards judge extremely biased spirit clearly figure far us political point view due respect political leader guided great dignity extremely important political force nation collected millions votes elections recalled 1976 exceeded even 12 million votes remained second party six days sudden disappearance took place 11 june 1984 communist party became first party italy european elections overcoming first time christian democracy even little 100,000 votes well front represented many italian citizens respect due join memory commemoration"
#MalanLucio,Mr President we are not at all reassured by the speech made by my colleague because Article 6a of the agreement which is ratified by the possible adoption of the draft law clearly states that for crimes disconnected from the service our military and it is not an abstract hypothesis but very concrete because there is a mission in place with Italian soldiers engaged there are subject to the courts of Qatar with the possibility that they may pay the penalty in Italy I remember as has already been said that in Qatar homosexuality is a crime and so is adultery which in Arabic is called by the generic name zina which basically indicates disordered sexual conduct This means that if two Italian soldiers have sexual intercourse and are not married they are committing this crime which is certainly not connected to their mission Therefore they would be subject to Qatari justice which provides for a severe penalty once there was also stoning now we can be reassured because we reach only a maximum of one hundred lashes and seven years of imprisonment We can assume that if the sentence is taken for granted in Italy the lashes are abounded but the seven years of imprisonment even if it is taken for granted in Italy does not really seem a reassuring thing to me We are so ready to recognize the rights of homosexuals sexual freedom and so on but then we consider here a very negligible fact that the Italian military in Qatar not by their own will obviously but sent on mission by the Italian Government can be subjected to such penalties At present there are also several others because Qatar 's main source of law is sharia which also includes beheadings amputations and so on In the face of these things I do not think it is enough to abstain We must vote against but I would urge the Government to reconsider to request a postponement and to negotiate again with the Qatari authorities another type of agreement We do not want to go against a treaty that exists but we can not even vote for it The best thing would be for the government to withdraw it and ask for a postponement avoiding this controversy because we usually manage to be united on the Armed Forces In fact we must all defend the men and women who go on mission to Italy You must not force us to vote against or otherwise,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,16.808832,1.7943722,30,mr president reassured speech made colleague article 6a agreement ratified possible adoption draft law clearly states crimes disconnected service military abstract hypothesis concrete mission place italian soldiers engaged subject courts qatar possibility may pay penalty italy remember already said qatar homosexuality crime adultery arabic called generic name zina basically indicates disordered sexual conduct means two italian soldiers sexual intercourse married committing crime certainly connected mission therefore would subject qatari justice provides severe penalty also stoning reassured reach maximum one hundred lashes seven years imprisonment assume sentence taken granted italy lashes abounded seven years imprisonment even taken granted italy really seem reassuring thing ready recognize rights homosexuals sexual freedom consider negligible fact italian military qatar obviously sent mission italian government subjected penalties present also several others qatar 's main source law sharia also includes beheadings amputations face things think enough abstain must vote would urge government reconsider request postponement negotiate qatari authorities another type agreement want go treaty exists even vote best thing would government withdraw ask postponement avoiding controversy usually manage united armed forces fact must defend men women go mission italy must force us vote otherwise
#MalanLucio,Mr President I would like to thank the President Senator Urso for what he has inevitably explained to us in summary terms because given the richness and the wide and important series of issues dealt with his oral report which complements what has already been written could only be a summary in summary terms I would also like to thank all the members of the Committee for their work which is obviously particularly important in this case both as a team and as a municipality because it must be common interest in national security One of the most important aspects that emerges from this report and also in general of intelligence activity is that of cybersecurity cybersecurity This is an increasingly important aspect because technology enters the everyday life of everyone and more importantly it is essential in the everyday life of companies institutions and our armed forces As I said it is therefore an extremely important aspect to the point that NATO has made it clear that the basic rule of the North Atlantic Treaty from an organisational point of view Article 5 which requires all Member States to intervene in defence of one of them if attacked should apply also in the event of cyber attacks and not only in the case of the classic military attacks for which there was obviously no doubt This is an extremely important aspect because a computer attack can cause serious damage in a country it can paralyse economic sectors and it can cause serious damage in the finance sector since obviously the computer tool is now indispensable even in the smallest of banking branches it can block the distribution of energy it can block aqueducts In the report on which we have heard the Committee president 's oral integration and which is at our disposal this issue is dealt with in a broad way The National Agency for Cybersecurity has just been set up and for which as I pointed out on that occasion I believe there is a need for much greater ambitions one cannot think of creating a small bureaucratized agency with some executive appointed on the basis of more political than technical reasoning in an area like this which would be reductive to define competitive When computer engineers practice to become more and more good more and more able to respond to the security needs of the companies or institutions in which they work or work they simply compete with each other and divide into two teams on the one hand someone tries to violate the security of that bank or that agency and on the other hand someone else tries to defend security and wins the best Whoever defends himself of course has greater margins as in all sectors but wins the best It is clear therefore that having someone who is good who is good who has listened to something cybersecurity is of no use because in this duel the opponent is potentially obviously not always of a very high level More attention must therefore be paid to this bearing in mind that cybersecurity must not only be passive but also able to act that is to say it must not only be able although this of course is essential to defend itself as effectively as possible against attacks violations of secrecy and even data retention but it must also be able and credible in carrying out counterattack actions because that is what happens The experts in the sector explain that there is a chance that sooner or later an attack will be successful and if we are only defending ourselves of course those who attack that is those who try to enter the computer systems try and try again and if it succeeds it has won because it knows that it will not have reactions Unfortunately many experts point out that Italy is particularly weak in this respect The Cybersecurity Agency is a step forward but it is a little too little and needs to be enhanced in its quality and also in its ability to react In no way should this aspect be underestimated Let us remember that one of the main ways in which cyber attacks take place is the so called ransomware that is an attack in exchange for a ransom they steal data from an important institution for example from a bank and they ask for a more or less substantial amount of money to return them because the quickest way of realizing for those who have stolen data unless they have done so as in some cases for industrial economic or other espionage purposes is precisely to get money given by the institution whose confidentiality has been violated The institution that is the victim has an interest in not letting it know because otherwise its image is damaged Therefore the fact that there is no news of this type of attack does not mean that this kind of attack has not already happened and unfortunately in some cases there may have been some successes We therefore need a great deal of attention in this respect The work done by our intelligence services and the Republic Security Committee itself is therefore extremely important although by its very nature it tends to be obscure I would like to mention another aspect which I find very interesting in the report the question of state secrecy There have been several requests from Parliament to overcome the secret of state on certain aspects much has been said about the issue of the serious attack on the synagogue the great Jewish temple of Rome when in 1982 a child was killed and there were several wounded including the brother of this child Well there have been very disturbing circumstances on the issue that is that no kind of protection had been sent precisely on that evening although there have been reports of the concrete and imminent danger of a terrorist activity precisely to the detriment of the Jewish community at the most solemn moment of their life that is the functions in the synagogue The secret of state is understandable and one of the resources that the state must have but there is a discipline and a law that say when by whom and how the secret of state should be placed Lately we have a similar attitude as on state secrecy to the purely commercial and economic operations carried out by the Extraordinary Commissioner for the management of the pandemic and we have tabled agendas to ask for clarity on all economic operations for the purchase of materials and services Well we have been told that we cannot respond on matters of confidentiality Too bad there is a law the anti-corruption law that much has been talked about and which has been given much importance which says that public administration expenditure must be made known promptly for issues of transparency and to combat corruption except where there is state secrecy When there is no state secret there must be transparency The instrument of state secrecy is important but the instrument of transparency and clarity in relations between the citizen and public administration is very important in democracy,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#UrsoAdolfo,Mr Urso FdI Mr President we have no doubts and no doubts as to where we are to stand Of course all the more so today when Sweden and Finland have ratified the Treaty of the Atlantic Alliance which ladies and gentlemen is not a formal fact but a historic event It is a historic event for three reasons indeed everything because the countries we welcome Sweden and Finland had made neutrality their raison d'être and now they have chosen were forced to choose It is a historic event for the moment when it occurs with a war on the borders of our Europe in which Italy like all Western and Atlantic democracies is committed to supporting Ukraine 's freedom its independence and its integrity It is a historic event because yes for once our country Italy and our Parliament have been united it is a virtually unanimous unity which I believe is due you must recognize it ladies and gentlemen the Italians recognize it to the precise determined coherent and responsible choice of Brothers of Italy who from the beginning encouraged Parliament to stand up for the attacker and against the aggressor If we had not made this choice of responsibility Italy would have once again appeared unreliable for your divisions and hesitations It is a historic turning point because Sweden and Finland are great democracies and with their accession it is strengthened and it is evident that at the basis of the Atlantic Alliance there are common values of freedom that today more than ever we must defend against the challenge launched by the totalitarian autocratic and imperial systems that want to subdue us as they are trying to subdue Ukraine and perhaps tomorrow Taipei This shows that the Atlantic Alliance has common values in the rule of law and in the democratic principles it expresses and protects in the emblematic value of freedom which if you will allow is the basis of well being I say this to some colleagues in the face of authoritarian systems that claim to be able to guarantee it better than us even in the absence of freedom Well being without freedom does n't interest us At the Madrid Summit as well as establishing membership of the Atlantic Alliance Russia was determined to be the most significant and direct threat and in these hours we must also realise what is happening in the Balkans Kosovo and Bosnia Herzegovina another of Putin 's objectives of expansionism as demonstrated by Lavrov 's failed journey At the same time it is important that this has happened while NATO redefines its objectives and Europe begins to come to an agreement on the need for a common defence which does not mean a common army but sharing security and defence with a scale of priority all the more important for what might still happen Sweden and Finland are great democracies but they are also countries that have developed an efficient military defense They will help us to protect the North Front where the threats to Kaliningrad then the Baltic States and the Arctic where Russia 's military expertise and supremacy in relation to the West will develop We will therefore be able to devote ourselves more to the South front where for the first time at the Madrid Summit the need for a centrality of the defence of the enlarged Mediterranean then of the Balkans the South Bank and Africa which must be our bet has been identified because that is where it develops and ends hopefully for us that is for the world of freedom and development the titanic confrontation between East and West 15:39 p.m. Follow Urso We Italians must be aware of this more than others in the protection of the enlarged Mediterranean in an Atlantic European policy towards Africa that is not only military but that it is above all a social economic and productive policy to grow and grow the continent with us Ladies and gentlemen other equally democratic countries I am referring to Germany and Japan today have already decided to change the Constitution in order to enable their peoples to defend themselves and to prepare a better defence We must reach as soon as possible the target of 2 of investment in the field of defence to make our contribution today more than ever decisive because it is in the enlarged Mediterranean that there is the greatest challenge between the West and the East not only towards Russia and Islamic fundamentalism but also China which in the enlarged Mediterranean finds its reasons for being and the natural outlet of its logic of economic and productive dominance through the Silk Road Ladies and gentlemen you are surprised that the right is on this position The right and those who know the history of the Republic know this has always been on the side of the Atlantic Alliance and has voted and helped to choose at the most decisive moments when Italy had to face the challenge This was also the case in 1983 when the Communist Party and the Italian left came to the streets against the installation of cruise and pershing missiles which were the decisive act in the cold war between the West and the East Then the Italian Social Movement voted for that decisive act and allowed Italy to be the first country to unlock the defense that is to install the cruise missiles to which the others would then follow while the Italian left was on another side on the other side of history which then turned out to be a loser You must not be surprised by our determination our coherence and our responsibility which led to the unity I would say almost unanimously of our Parliament even when we had to vote on sending weapons to Kiev Attention because it is not over here we all know that the months to come and the coming weeks will be decisive also with regard to the war conflict and we must be aware coherent and responsible at all times and support with determination and continuity the Ukrainian resistance in the face of the invader who uses every means of destruction more and more bloody We must give a signal of reliability We 'll do it by the majority of course If the citizens want to if the voters reserve us the leadership of the country we will be assured that Italy will keep its commitments because it is our national interest I hope that the opposition of the future will not change its position I hope that the political forces represented here will not change their position in changing the minds of the majority to the opposition I hope that you too will show the same coherence determination and responsibility as we have set an example in these months and years,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#UrsoAdolfo,"Mr President I have been speaking for the first time in this House since I was elected President of the Copasir using the time that my Group has given me to highlight first of all precisely what the Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic has done in recent months on the very issues that we will now have to deal with in a climate of emergency in the wake of the war in our Europe It will then be Senator La Russa in his explanation of vote who will explain the Group 's position Over the last few months we have been working intensively with our colleagues in the Copasir as required by the law under conditions of secrecy with investigations hearings and analyses which we have taken into account in specific reports to Parliament these yes in public In them we have highlighted among other things very clearly Russia 's aggressive posture not only in Ukraine and Eastern Europe but in every area of strategic Italian and European interest from the Balkans to the Caucasus from the Mediterranean to the Sahel according to a strategy aimed at maintaining energy supremacy controlling raw materials also in order to encircle our Europe We had also pointed out what was happening in Belarus with the constitutional referendum the new threats that arise in Bosnia and Kosovo the strengthening of the Russian military device in Syria the presence of Wagner 's mercenaries in Libya and the military coups six in the Sahel at the border of our enlarged Mediterranean which pave the way for Wagner Significant however only the joint naval maneuvers of Russia China and Iran held in January in the Gulf of Oman We had also made clear the need for a genuine European defence as the President in Office of the Council pointed out today complementary to NATO in order to increase the defence of the Atlantic Alliance on our continent and in the enlarged Mediterranean Soon we will deliver the report on space as a geopolitical factor on which Italy the sixth civil space power in the world can play an important role Defence and space will also be the subject of the decisions that Europe will have to take in March with the Strategic Compass and the project of strategic spatial autonomy now more than ever necessary However we have already pointed out in the recent annual report how completely inadequate the European defence project which in the state provides for a rapid intervention force of just 5,000 soldiers when Italy alone has a device of 9,200 soldiers on international missions The alleged commitments declared as a result of the wretched withdrawal from Afghanistan do not receive more resources Indeed in the new European budget the resources allocated to the various European defence projects have actually been halved Now it is clear to everyone that we need to change because Europe is under threat and we will know how to do it Precisely for this reason our first thought today goes to the Ukrainian resistance to the families in the shelters that on social networks ask for help to the girls who pack the Molotov bottles to the workers who dig the trenches to slow the advance of the tanks Our thoughts go to the young people who hold a rifle even though they have never done military service to those who return home to defend their families and their land to a heroic people who have finally discovered that they are a true nation without distinction of languages and religion as never before in their own tortured history They remind us today with the sacrifice of struggle what our values are awakening our numb consciences to them Putin made a gamble that got the effect of raising global public opinion united as never before Even within Russia itself there are protesters who risk imprisonment and repression This is the first important lesson a warning to anyone in the world who thinks that freedom also has a price that is measurable in rubles dollars or r enminbi a warning to anyone in the world who thinks that freedom can be removed without raising the unanimous reaction of those who like us believe and live in freedom The heroic resistance of the Ukrainians marks a first and an after in the global conflict between Western democracies and authoritarian systems a turning point that will be marked in the calendar of history What has happened to us must finally be a lesson to address issues that we have been putting aside for decades as if they were affecting others while they concern us and especially our children who will pay the price if we do not intervene immediately Investment in defence is certainly necessary as Germany has just done but also investment in research technology training the digital economy and artificial intelligence space and cyber energy sovereignty and the protection of strategic assets without which any autonomy and independence can be preserved The Copasir has presented six thematic reports and an annual report in this parliamentary term in which it has dealt with what is being discussed today Ladies and gentlemen none of these reports have yet been dealt with in a way that Parliament has done although some of the important speeches we have mentioned have been made by the golden power system at the National Cybersecurity Agency which fills a ten year delay The same fate in the void had the other reports presented in previous legislation as well as the annual reports of the Presidency of the Council We have been too distracted about the issues of national security we must now take note of them A session of Parliament must be held soon as we have specifically requested in our document sent to the Chambers before the situation falls What is happening makes us understand how important the security of the Republic is and how much this must be considered in every decision we take even when we address the issues of energy or the digital economy technology artificial intelligence space as well as steel infrastructure assets as industrial supply chains knowing that our systemic opponents i.e. authoritarian systems use them fully in their comparison with Western democracies All this is part of what is called a hybrid war In this regard we have highlighted the need to have economic intelligence at the service of the Italy system which is proactive in protecting the country 's science and technology and productive assets Yes it is true sanctions are producing their devastating effects but arms must also be stopped responding to the heartfelt requests for help from those threatened in life and affections as even countries that have always been historically neutral such as Switzerland and Sweden are doing Now is the time of the field choices for everyone Of course we will also pay the costs of sanctions especially as a result of the price of energy or if you will allow me ladies and gentlemen as a result of our wrong energy choices that have made us more vulnerable than other European partners It is precisely on energy security that we presented a report to Parliament in January in which we highlighted the criticalities of the system and its dangerous vulnerabilities in the face of both the necessary ecological transition and the hegemonic action of the state actors In that report we already identified some solutions that were the subject of the urgent decree in these hours and concluded that it was necessary to implement an energy security plan that would reduce dependence from abroad and above all from Russia with the objective of energy independence and productive and technological autonomy in collaboration with Western European partners also in view of the increasingly evident geopolitical factors and risks already at that time In the annual report for the security of the cyber network Yesterday however the Agency launched a particularly significant alarm also because Russia is the best equipped state in the world for cyber warfare To complete the defensive line we recalled the need to implement the national public administration cloud and the single public controlled network as soon as possible I 'm finishing Ladies and gentlemen Russia has long been preparing for confrontation with the West He 's been investing in the two weapons he owns for ten years energy resources and the armed forces It aims to control the raw materials and borders of Europe to subdue Ukraine today to subdue the Baltic Republics Georgia and Moldova tomorrow Now we all know why and we must raise the level of defence even in the face of a world in which other equally aggressive actors emerge first of all China the primary technological and productive power capable indeed of aspiring to global supremacy We can't escape history but we can change it With the unitary resolution that we will vote today a new phase in the political life of the country really begins that sees us always united when the security of the Republic is at stake and with it the fundamental values of

#UrsoAdolfo,Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister in the introduction you said in the end aware of the climate in this House that the agenda of this G7 so important and significant for the moment when it falls and for the city in which it takes place Berlin was a long agenda perhaps too long added boring given the climate of the House I could perhaps add terribly useless So a long agenda too long boring perhaps useless that does not take account of reality We who are a patriotic force of patriotic opposition must necessarily take account of reality and therefore the first thing we tell you about this agenda considering also the debate that took place a moment ago in the House and here in the Senate is that there seems to be Alice in the country of wonders I believe that you Minister have shown in recent months that you are not Alice in the country of wonders indeed you have shown that you speak frankly in Parliament and to the country already before the invasion of Russia in Ukraine when it was to be addressed as must be dealt with anyway and regardless the issue of energy security and its impact on the economy in the light of the ecological transition I would remind my fellow Senators that the Parliamentary Committee on the Security of the Republic forty days before the invasion of Russia in Ukraine has presented a report in Parliament and not by chance whose title is The report on energy security in the current phase of ecological transition because already before the invasion of Russia in Ukraine we of the Committee were aware and I believe that Parliament should be the same that the issue of energy security was already present or had to be present on our country 's agenda precisely in order to achieve the ecological transition objectives that we all share in Italy and in our European Union We hope that at the G7 summit you will make it clear that the fairy tale is over and that Germany and Europe must face reality first and foremost in the field of energy and the environment What does that mean ladies and gentlemen It means energy security and food security which is not obvious Just now there were those who pointed out how as a result of climate change there could be massive migratory movements of some ten million people from here to a few decades I think that this threat is much more imminent and does not concern future generations but our generation indeed the coming weeks and months If food security is not guaranteed for countries that live beyond the Mediterranean on the south bank in black Africa if Ukrainian ports are not liberated and those peoples are not allowed to supply grain and other food we will have that migratory mass that will come to press as a demographic bomb launched by those who have conceived a permanent war that is enucleated in a hybrid war of which energy is one of the elements of power and of which food is one of the other assets on which it can lever to press and subdue our Europe Of all this we find nothing on this agenda without realizing that if the G7 takes place in Berlin if it takes place a few months after the Russian invasion in Ukraine war still fought today it takes place with a stone feast which is Russia However we returned to the G7 I remind myself certainly not to our colleagues precisely because Russia had already invaded Ukraine in 2014 As a result of that invasion with the annexation of Crimea and militias disguised as independentists in the Donbass in Lugansk and Donetsk Russia was excluded from the G8 From 2014 to today too many years have passed without us noticing what the first war of invasion of Ukraine meant having then suffered the second more bloody than the first because at the first we could not react Above all it has not been able to react to Germany which today lists us as if nothing had changed the agenda of the next G7 energy and environment without mea culpa on the fact that on energy Germany has supported Russia 's power policy and has actually made us dependent to all intents and purposes Certainly we Italians have done the same as far as our responsibility is concerned We must therefore and I hope the Government will do so bring the situation back to reality even at that summit where we find ourselves It is no coincidence Minister that the President of the Draghi Council prefers to arrive at the extraordinary European Council without passing through the parliamentary classrooms as we the opposition force demand for clarity and transparency towards the country even though we support you must acknowledge this the unitary policy which we hope to be unanimous of our country in order to face the serious threat to Ukraine its freedom and independence and at the same time to some extent our freedom and independence It is no coincidence that he wants to go to the European Council without going to this House also because let us be clear it is precisely on energy that Europe is losing its unity Weeks ago we were told that the sixth package of sanctions against Russia was ready weeks have passed and this package of sanctions does not see the light precisely because it concerns energy in this case oil and then gas We were also told that the legal office would make payment in rubles impossible and then the opposite happened because the energy issue is the central theme of European submission to the policy of power of other nations and other countries and it is not only resolved in the field of good intentions or just keeping commitments We believe that commitments must be maintained in order to reach the end that energy transition and therefore ecological useful for the environment but recent events have shown that the other countries I speak of China India and not only have no interest in doing all this indeed they have taken advantage of the crisis to have other fossil energy at a better cost We know that we will not solve the problems of the Planet if we do not involve these countries but we must also know that alone we cannot take responsibility for the problems of the world without being aware of our priorities That is why I believe it is important Minister and I say this also in this House that the country clearly addresses the issue of energy security and food security not only for us but for others As far as energy security is concerned I believe that it is essential otherwise the commitments made also in the field of the environment will be essentially of façade and impossible to achieve We need a national energy security plan which will make the country understand the tools technologies and times to reach that national European and Western energy independence and independence without which we will not be able to defend our independence and therefore our sovereignty Starting with the conclusion this is also linked to the problem of technology because we run the risk of moving from a technology that makes us succubis of Russia that of coal to another technology on renewables that makes us succubis of China We would fall from the pan to the fire so it is more necessary than ever to achieve a strategic energy and production autonomy

#UrsoAdolfo,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen I have spoken for the second time in this House since I was elected President of Copasir in June last year I did so only during the Government 's communications on the war in Ukraine to take into account the alarms expressed by the Committee in its reports on Russia 's aggressive posture in Ukraine and more generally in Europe and the enlarged Mediterranean in the Balkans Libya and the Sahel Africa an increased threat over time aimed at encircling Europe including through the control of energy and raw materials ready to use all means in a modern terrible and pervasive hybrid war We had highlighted the Russian military deployment around Ukraine as well as the consequences of the constitutional referendum in Belarus which would cancel the neutrality of that country thus allowing Russian troops to act even with nuclear devices from Belarus We had highlighted over time even in previous reports the action of Russian espionage and recruitment in our country the pervasiveness of Russian penetration in Europe aimed at conditioning democratic institutions the aggressive action carried out in the new war domains in space and in cyber and the systematic use of Wagner mercenaries not only in Africa We had written among other things and I quote a military escalation in Ukraine could lead to a further worsening of the situation which would also be ruinous especially for Italy which owes more than 40 of gas imports to Moscow We wrote it down Furthermore on energy security the Copasir produced a specific report to Parliament on 9 January of this year at the end of more than six months of study In that report we highlighted the need to free ourselves from foreign dependence all the more so from countries such as Russia which use energy as a power factor In that report we pointed out some solutions which are then the solutions that the government is now preparing to launch in the wake of the emergency Already then we talked about the need to double national gas production to diversify sources to use the state 's replacement power for the solar and wind power plants that were blocked We were already talking about the fourth generation of nuclear power and the hypothesis of nuclear fusion which President Draghi quoted a few days ago in the House of Deputies They were all indications already contained in our report on energy security Just as in the conclusion of the report we clearly indicated the absolute need to implement a national energy security plan in order to achieve strategic technological and productive autonomy in the Western European framework which we are finally talking about in the face of the emergency Ladies and gentlemen today we are finally discussing national security thoroughly on the basis of the Copasir 's annual report of 14 February This is important news Ladies and gentlemen as we said in the beginning of the report it has never happened in the past that an annual report by the Copasir or an annual report by the Presidency of the Council were examined in this House Law No 124 of 2007 fifteen years ago provides for these two reports which have never been examined in Parliament either in Parliament or in the Commission For this reason on behalf of the Committee I would like to thank the Presidency and the parliamentary groups for having shared the need as I hope every year for a specific parliamentary session This was what we asked for in the premise of our annual report a parliamentary session such as the one that takes place every year on justice with legislative consequences In recent years only one debate has taken place in this House on a subject for which Copasir was responsible in 2009 with then President Rotelli This was the case with the interceptions on which incidentally many years later on 21 October last year we were forced to make a report to Parliament ourselves In our report on the system of interceptions we denounced how a situation of absolute discretion on the modalities and criteria by which mandates are entrusted to carry out judicial interceptions also concerning the conservation or destruction of the same I would remind everyone that we are under European infringement procedure because the prosecutors do not intend to implement what is laid down in a specific European directive and what is laid down in Italian law We are waiting for the Minister of Justice to keep what he promised to do during the hearing In other cases however our reports have been followed by concrete actions I am referring for example to cybersecurity which was the subject of our first report to Parliament at the beginning of the parliamentary term It has led to the extension of golden power to the telecommunications sector to the realization of the national perimeter on cybersecurity to the birth albeit only last June with more than ten years of delay of the Agency for national cybersecurity On the other hand we have not been followed up by our request at the time to identify a crime that would allow the perpetrators of the attacks to be prosecuted properly and to prepare an active defence which will obviously be discussed in the next few days In this report we also highlight the need to implement as soon as possible the national cloud of public administration the single public controlled network a strategic policy for maritime connection European technological and productive autonomy in the digital economy Unfortunately ladies and gentlemen there has not been enough attention even when we noticed that Russia is the most equipped state in the cybernetic war and today we have to think about how to eliminate the criticalities that may arise from the fact that Russian antivirus software is used as Trojan horses In these hours the Government of course also at our request will take other necessary measures of which we have been properly informed as always happens in a full and loyal confrontation between the institutional bodies The same is true even more so of Chinese technology which is far more pervasive as we have shown three years ago and reiterated in this report and which unfortunately is not successful calls for the use of Chinese technology in the telecommunications system to be inhibited Other indications of the Committee have been incorporated and taken into account in this report for example with the extension of golden power to the financial and banking sector and other important strategic assets of the country including the health chain or with the criminal law that punishes the detention of material for terrorist purposes I am also thinking of the indication contained in our report on how to combat Islamic radicalisation and the new forms of jihadist terrorism which we presented following the fall of Kabul into the Taliban regime This indication has recently been transposed by the House 's Committee on Constitutional Affairs and therefore we have taken a step forward Surely there is much more to be done In our annual report we have highlighted some strategic assets of the country that we have dealt with in our annual activity from research to university to the protection of patents of technology from the digital economy to port infrastructures from the steel industry to the automotive one from semiconductors to batteries from hydrogen to the recycling of precious minerals from the new dual competition on space to the defence industry On space as a geopolitical factor today we are talking about interspace war and on European defence we are about to conclude after months of investigation two specific reports that we will present to you in the next few days investigations that we have not by chance activated after the wretched withdrawal from Afghanistan In the annual report however we have already pointed out a number of observations on European defence Specifically we have anticipated that it already seemed insufficient to us well before the Russian invasion in Ukraine a forecast of just 5,000 soldiers as a European rapid force in view of the fact that only Italy employs 9,200 soldiers on international missions In this report too we have told you how inadequate the resources provided for in the European Union 's multiannual financial framework have appeared to us resources that have been halved compared to the previous budget Now of course everything will change under the pressure of war as Germany has done and if Germany has you understand that we have to do so too But let us ask ourselves whether the Russian threat is not also the result of European distraction of our unwillingness to see what was happening We can't do this anymore Let 's have it This is also why a broad chapter of the report concerns economic intelligence all the more important in the face of the hybrid war that has been going on for years not since today and of which the main issue is our enlarged Mediterranean It is a hybrid war in which authoritarian systems China and Russia in the lead but not only aspire to technological and economic supremacy also through the control of the energy and food resources of the planet from gas to water of raw materials precious minerals and rare earths of everything that serves the digital and ecological economy we must absolutely realize it but it is falling under their control Who has not noticed we have noticed that in recent months six military coups have taken place of which five have succeeded in four countries of the Sahel in two of which obviously have called the mercenaries of Wagner Economic intelligence and cyber intelligence bond with each other To put it to your attention we have conducted a confrontation with some Western democracies with our Western democracies the United States France Japan and Sweden who have long developed economic intelligence to understand what can be done more and better in democratic countries to protect our technology and our businesses our science and creativity our society and therefore our freedoms Something has been done with current legislation at our request fully shared by the Government and we also acknowledge this to the Undersecretary Gabrielli as we did in our report But even more needs to be done with specific legislative changes because what has been done so far is in existing legislation It is Parliament 's job to change the law In this context we have pointed out that the golden power instrument is useful necessary but not sufficient We also need an industrial policy that aims to preserve and if possible strengthen the country 's strategic assets The same tool as the golden power greatly strengthened in recent years is still little used Look at the reports to Parliament on golden power We say that because sometimes Parliament is distracted The golden power instrument itself which has been considerably strengthened over the past few years at the Committee 's own initiative needs to be further adapted to the evidence that it has been put into practice The case of Alpi Aviation a small company with a high technological content which we have examined and which we take into account in our report on which the Government has recently intervened blocking the sale to a Chinese state owned company has determined us to ask that the golden power instrument also include preventive monitoring action in order to protect small and medium sized enterprises with high technological content as happens in other countries such as the United States This is in our relationship Our report always has a precise method of empirical work it starts from a specific case such as the one mentioned above and takes into account our requests to the Government to act within the limits of existing legislation This is the case during hearings see the number of hearings held last year especially in the second part of the year or through specific information notes to the competent authorities read the specific information notes we sent and to whom we sent them Finally through the reports to Parliament we urge the legislator to intervene For example in the field of monitoring the work of the intelligence sector on which there is a whole chapter and which is the Committee 's main task we found the Marco Polo Council case Our activity in this regard has allowed the authority of the sector to prepare a first measure on the incompatibility of the summits of the Intelligence after the cessation of the service A measure published on an extraordinary basis in the Official Journal so that third parties may be aware of it Now we need to improve the legislative framework which is Parliament 's job As well as I hope I hope other bodies of the State will also do as far as they are competent In the final part of the report we therefore provide some guidance on what we consider necessary to amend in Law 124 An excellent law but passed in 2007 fifteen years ago when the hybrid war was not even imaginable when Russia was basically still in the spirit of Sea Practice In the report we say that it is already necessary to do so called ordinary maintenance but absolutely necessary and we also list the points where action is needed At the same time however we have pointed out that legislation needs to be revised more significantly also with regard to the architecture and expertise of intelligence agencies For this reason we have announced that in the next and final report at the end of the legislature at the end of further investigation we will provide our relevant information in a preventive comparison to the Copasir with the Government Among other things we have dealt with one issue which emerged in both this parliamentary term and the previous one concerning the composition of the Committee at the time when the majority opposition parliamentary position changed In the previous parliamentary term he had been pleaded with a transitional legend increasing the number of members of the Committee have we forgotten that We have not forgotten that We have therefore proposed in this report a regulatory solution allowing the Presidents of the Chambers to intervene when the majority opposition distribution changes to regulate the Committee 's activities which in fact in the first six months of last year see the number of hearings and speeches had practically reduced to a small number almost paralyzing itself compared to what we did in the second part of the year The work of the Parliamentary Committee on the Security of the Republic cannot be paralyzed it cannot of course be done today Ladies and gentlemen reading the combined provisions of the annual report and the report on energy security someone wrote that the Copasir had foreseen what would happen some journalists have been psyched on this with military aggression in Ukraine Something significant we had said in the ways in which we could say it of course on the basis of the secret hearings that we had held and therefore the information that we ourselves received because our source of information is the hearings the Intelligence the Government the authorities that we summon nothing else to avoid misunderstandings Now we must react aware that we are at a turning point in history to an epochal passage The world we dreamed of is gone and maybe there was n't even yesterday there is a before and after and it does n't help to recriminate or reproach or worse still put in trouble the opponent or ally for what he had declared in other times in another historical age when he had other information This is a game of massacre that the country does n't need It is the moment of unity and responsibility as they have been realized unity and responsibility in the resolution that defines what Italy 's position on the war in Ukraine should be a war that concerns us because it is a part of the hybrid war that with different but equally devastating means authoritarian systems have developed towards Western democracies to subdue us and if you like even to some extent to take away our freedoms It is also a problem for the West Let me give you an example that must be clear to everyone because technology develops and today technology allows algorithms through facial recognition and only through that to understand what are the political opinions of the citizen who is subjected to facial recognition without other information You understand well what this means compared to countries where social control of dissent is prevalent and in countries such as ours where the privacy and freedoms of individuals communities and nations are fundamental That is why I hope that the same unity and responsibility will be realized whenever we address the issues of the security of the Republic which is not only control over intelligence I say this in the absence of misunderstandings The parliamentary committee for the security of the Republic already in its name which Parliament chose in 2007 unlike the previous Copaco is not limited to the control of intelligence it also does that of course and it is not limited to the apparatuses of the State either because we are not talking about state security The name refers to the security of the Republic which is something more and different the legislator has been far sighted than the control of intelligence or even simply the control of state security That is why we have dealt with thematic reports we have done six in this parliamentary term of which three in the last six months The arguments seem irrelevant to those who do not look from the perspective of national security but today we know how important the report we have made on financial security and the insurance system of our country in the face of the decisions that for example Europe and the Western world have had to take on financial sanctions against Russia In the same way we realize how important the cyber security report of three years ago was regarding the possibility of a cybernetic attack in our country and the measures that must be taken to prevent that through the Trojan horse of technology we can expropriate our information or worse still trigger a cybernetic war in our country I hope therefore that the same unity and responsibility will be fulfilled whenever we speak of security to the Republic and that at last every year there will be a report with a meeting with final resolutions in which the report of the Presidency of the Council which is held every year in February and the annual report of the Copasir will be examined and compared so that Parliament and the country can be aware of how the needs of the Republic 's security change with respect of course to what happens in every international context I believe that this is useful for Parliament to come up with the necessary measures I believe that in this case we could really say that we have responded to the needs of the country I conclude ladies and gentlemen by saying that we must realise that we cannot escape history even if we may wish to We cannot escape from history and history today requires us to take the necessary measures immediately as regards our defence our security and the strategic assets of our country to face together with the other Western democracies in our European Union and in our Atlantic Alliance what we have before us We cannot escape history but we can change history",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,11.155968,4.642054,30,"mr president ladies gentlemen spoken second time house since elected president

#UrsoAdolfo,Mr President first of all I would like to thank the Members who have thought that they have spoken here for the ideas they have given us on which we will then make our subsequent reflections in the context of the meetings that the Committee will develop Of course I would like to thank my colleagues from the Committee who have spoken Senators Arrigoni Castiello and Magorno because as they have pointed out the Committee acts as it must as a team and not by chance all the reports it has submitted under the three Presidencies of this legislature have been unanimously approved This shows that there has been a sharing beyond belongings and the placement between majority and opposition Of course I also thank the intelligence men who are often engaged in crisis theatres In a few days as every year there will be a ceremony at the intelligence headquarters in memory of their fallen men to protect the nation during their missions I would like to respond specifically to some of my colleagues on the issues that have been highlighted The Copasir hearing was held today on energy by Mr Cingolani who will be speaking here tomorrow morning To answer Senator D'Arienzo I will give an emblematic figure twenty years ago we imported 20 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia today we import 29 30 billion that is 10 billion more that are exactly what we produce less from our deposits because twenty years ago we produced 15 billion cubic meters of gas in Italy and imported 20 billion from Russia today we produce in Italy 3 4 billion and we import 10 more from Russia To my friend and colleague Senator Gasparri who stresses the risk of other supplies I say that it is true if as we will do we will diversify our sources to provide more from Africa not only Algeria Libya or Egypt but also from Congo and Angola then we will have to understand that Africa is in our main interests because if we abandon it then it is worse than turning or abandoning Russian gas We must therefore make a strategic policy for Africa I would point out to Senator Gallone who highlighted our speech on hydropower that Parliament will decide next week whether our assessments of national interest should also lead to the modification or suspension of competitions which we alone do in the European context Senator Malan and Senator Pinotti rightly talk about the Cybersecurity Agency which is important I also believe that it is significant what the Government intends to prepare shortly to eliminate some critical conditions compared to Russian Kaspersky software and not only Senator Pinotti rightly proposes to hold a parliamentary session on European defence and defence in general I believe that this is very important also the light of what Mr Arrigoni pointed out about the Italian defence industry which must have its own policy We have in fact assisted and we have evidenced to the fact that a very important company like Leonardo anticipates a defense industry policy and another just as important as Fincantieri anticipates a different one There is therefore a need all the more so in this area for a national defence industry policy To Senator D'Arienzo who addresses the topic of economic intelligence linking it also to the European one I respond that on the economic front you cannot develop a European intelligence because it is clear to everyone that the interests and the modalities of intervention are different just think of France which is one of the most active subjects on economic intelligence On the other hand cooperation on military intelligence and even more significant integration can and must be developed In this regard only in parenthesis I would point out to this House how important the evolution of Atlantic intelligence is I am referring specifically to the possibility of enlargement of five eyes the five eyes that share information among them that we ourselves cannot share It has emerged quite clearly in this Russian war in Ukraine how much the American Intelligence and English Intelligence evidently share with each other and with the other three countries of the so called five eyed information that is not necessarily shared with us There is an important problem that we have to deal with from this point of view I shall conclude on the subject of desegregation put by President Marilotti whom I thank for what he has done and is doing We will deliver to this Parliament a report not on the Moro praise Mr Gasparri although perhaps it would be necessary but on how to improve the regulations in order to make the best conservation of acts It is undoubtedly true what Senator Marilotti had denounced a few days ago with the current legislation or better with its current execution it would take two hundred and thirty years only to desegretate the acts contained here in the Senate of the Republic Finally I respond to secret contracts about which Senators Magorno and Gasparri spoke the legislation concerns secret contracts which according to European standards should also include contracts for the custody of interceptions by the judiciary Instead the judiciary believes that unlike other European countries we are a special case and secret contracts are not handed over to the Authority that the Government and Parliament have identified for control which is the Special Section of the Court of Auditors I would add that in recent days the Court of Auditors has also given us further documentation on the possibility that failure to implement the European directive and failure to deliver secreted contracts to the special office of the Court of Auditors may also interfere with the validity of the ongoing proceedings And here I conclude so as not to open up other very important issues,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,13.144189,1.0564388,30,mr president first would like thank members thought spoken ideas given us make subsequent reflections context

#IwobiTonyChike,IWOBI L SP PSd Az Madam President members of the Government ladies and gentlemen today we are called upon to express ourselves on this important draft ratification law concerning the accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the Atlantic Alliance It is certainly a significant step given the long tradition of non-alignment that these two countries had in the post war period a strategic approach that of non-alignment which allowed Sweden and Finland to remain close to the West but to maintain a good relationship with the cumbersome Soviet neighbour The historic decision of the two countries to stop this strategic approach to officially join NATO is clearly a direct consequence of the Russian aggression in Ukraine last February which has followed several assertive Moscow policies over the years This does not mean that the choice of Sweden and Finland is due solely to quota factors Both countries have started a process of modernisation and transformation of their security and defence policies which has made military cooperation with the Atlantic Alliance increasingly frequent and which makes their entry an added value for the Atlantic bloc A small strategic reflection on NATO 's enlargement to these two countries We are talking about a new enlargement director towards the North who clearly brings new opportunities and new challenges Expanding the perimeter of security entails unprecedented burdens and responsibilities for NATO Competition on the Arctic at the moment marginal in the interests of the Atlantic Alliance can regain a new weight as a result of this accession process The Russian invasion in Ukraine has given great prominence to the East European front which has returned to the centre of NATO 's interests The aggressive policies of China which is considered the real challenger of the international order by the countries of the Alliance will force things to concentrate efforts and burdens on the Asia Pacific quadrant These are challenges that as NATO 's founding country we need to know and support It is good to remember however that our strategic interests are mostly located in the so called South front in the enlarged Mediterranean basin Asymmetric threats such as terrorism political instability leading to crises and mass migration the energy supply match these elements are priorities for our foreign policy and must be our objective to bring back the focus of the Atlantic Alliance also towards the South front In conclusion Sweden and Finland have realised that there is no security outside a cohesive political military organization like NATO and have knocked on our door It 's our duty Open it to him As our secretary Matteo Salvini stated Italy 's membership of the Atlantic Alliance is not in question and it is not a political crisis or a change of government that can question this reality We belong proudly to the history and culture of the West we can only be on the side of the free countries and we work to ensure that the future is a future of peace For these reasons I declare the vote in favour of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo

#IwobiTonyChike,Mr President Mr President in Office of the Council members of the Government ladies and gentlemen Russia 's military operation today leads us more than ever to question ourselves as a people as a nation and as a European Union about the importance of the value of peace Speaking of peace today as the primary and decisive objective of the Russian Ukrainian conflict is fortunately a wish shared by all of us The question is if anything how to reach it It is clear that today more than ever there is a sense of the importance of a common European foreign and defence policy which actually leads the Union to gain greater international weight and full strategic autonomy in all fora Unfortunately the sinking of the Minsk Accords and the worsening of the current situation lead us to hope for a more central and incisive role of the European Union than today above all as a promoter of the values of peace even beyond its borders The reasons behind this conflict are multiple and the symptoms could be analysed for a long time but beyond every single reason what is certain is the unacceptable military aggression to a democracy at the gates of Europe thus opening up a wound and a new drama within a continent that in the past decades has already suffered for a long time because of wars The main points to consider are to avoid the immediate extension of this conflict to reach the conclusion of military actions as soon as possible by using diplomacy as the only possible means of resolving disputes If this is a shared goal it is equally important to conceive ways of achieving this result It is clear that a cross-cutting sanctioning action where not well thought out can also have serious consequences of an economic industrial energy and therefore social nature in European countries and especially in our country The sanctions mechanism must therefore be considered as a strategic deterrent which in order to be such must minimise the consequences on the economies of the Member States of the European Union and at the same time to ensure the effectiveness of its scope Some consequences will certainly be inevitable even in the light of the effects that we are still experiencing in connection with the pandemic crisis However we trust in the wise decision of the Italian Government to ensure that Italy 's position in the possible adoption of sanctions against Russia is taken into account in the appropriate forums At this very difficult stage it is called upon to take decisions that require a collective and supranational conscience for the security of all its citizens and for the objective of peace With the hope that the conflict will cease as soon as possible an important test for the European Union will be the joint management of the reception of Ukrainian refugees I am sure that Italy will be at the forefront of reaffirming the values of European solidarity guaranteeing shared humanitarian corridors I shall conclude Mr President by expressing our full solidarity with the Ukrainian people and reaffirming the great sense of responsibility which must animate this like any other Parliament both to resolve the current situation and above all to avoid a dangerous military escalation with devastating and unpredictable effects on both sides We express our full trust in the Italian Government and in diplomacy,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#RautiIsabella,RAUTI FdI Mr President the world has changed since 24 February Russia 's military aggression against Ukraine has broken a global geopolitical order and has also brought into crisis a security paradigm for the entire West It is a war in Europe and European countries strengthen their defence and security structures welcome some countries more than others Ukrainian refugees and send aid and weapons systems In the face of the Ukrainian crisis Europe was forced to cope with the prolonged absence of a foreign policy the weakness of its diplomacy and the lack of a common defence force Italian diplomacy did not play a leading role in the scenario of tension and crisis that preluded the outbreak of war We were let 's say quite absent and silent but also a little marginalized in those international attempts then failed to find a diplomatic solution After the outbreak of the war the Italian Government committed itself to an important resolution supported also by Brothers of Italy which condemns the aggression of Russia shares the European decision on sanctions against Russia and establishes the right of reception for Ukrainian refugees Again the first Ukrainian decree we know that there will be others is approved in the House I would say almost unanimously however with a very large majority with the favorable vote of Brothers of Italy a favorable vote be it clear not to the Government but to the contents of the decree a vote ours which expresses the condemnation of the Russian military attack on Ukraine and its people attack on national sovereignty freedom independence and the right of those people to self determination Our position was clear from the beginning and we have never changed it an inevitable inexorable choice of field on the one hand tanks and on the other the civilian population on the one hand the aggressor and on the other the attacker And while always trusting in diplomacy negotiations and the resolution of conflicts with international law there are moments like this where there is no room for hesitation for sophisticated distinctions and for a sort of hairy pacifism We will never do the eulogy of war we are terrified of it like everyone else and we are horrified of it but we do not even accept I want to be clear those who claim the surrender of the Ukrainians as a duty Only the Ukrainian people can claim the right to surrender just as they can be the only one to exercise their right to defend themselves and defend their national sovereignty We believe that the aggressor must rely on solidarity and support from Western democracies I return to the decree law approved also with the vote of Brothers of Italy to the House it is a consensus dictated by the Ukrainian crisis and the emergency in which we crashed It is a decree law that provides I remind those who pretend to forget it today also military aid and the participation of military personnel in the upgrading of existing NATO devices such as for example the deployment of Alliance forces in the Baltic Republics the surveillance of the Alliance 's airspace the naval surveillance device and more As we have denounced both the House and the Senate in the Commission trying to amend without success the text in this sense in this decree law there is no intervention to protect Italian families and businesses from expensive bills There is no intervention which is also present in all our amendments on which the Budget Committee has expressed a contrary opinion in order to support businesses and households against expensive bills You also rejected the amendment on unaccompanied minors So we ask ourselves a lot of questions You did not want to face the damage caused by the economic rebound of sanctions which falls on Italy on our trade and on our companies Thus while Germany decides to raise its military expenditure to the threshold of 2 of annual GDP and even to create a special fund of EUR 100 billion dedicated to arms and while France chooses to increase its investment in security and defence in Italy President Draghi to be exact at the Versailles European Council reaffirms the respect for commitments not binding but still signed with allies already in 2006 I remember and relaunched at the Summit in Wales in 2014 i.e. those of 2 of GDP for defence expenditure The government therefore reiterates old commitments and assumes new ones it does so in the House on 16 March also approving an agenda linked to the decree law on Ukraine which commits it to progressively increase the expenses of the defence towards the goal precisely of 2 of GDP Let us make it clear that we in 2020 were in the world ranking in 102nd place and therefore perhaps we should do something The government assumes a precise posture There are I have here dozens of statements which I could of course re-emphasise about the positions taken by the President in Office of the Council and the Minister of Defence but in a few days at some point everything changes and we are today The Italian government is screwed on itself it takes two steps forward and one back it swings it crawls We are here without a rapporteur and paradoxically with the request for a vote of confidence with which basically let 's say more than ever the Government disowns itself I would like to remind you that our agenda for those who had not read it and had only told it did not indicate a time period in the commitments in which there is no 2024 written and this is of its importance In addition it was asked to be consistent with what has already been said So I come to the conclusion Those resources are needed for barracks equipment training air bases hangars everything that needs to be renovated in defense they are needed for cyber challenges That 's what the expense increases are for Dear colleagues of the League I also address you Our choice today not to vote for trust in the Ukraine decree is easy because you do not deserve our trust Our choice is a must it is called consistency We would also have voted in the Senate as in the House in favour of this bill of conversion of the decree law if it had had a normal path with amendments agendas improvements or a comparison On the contrary the recourse to yet another vote of confidence on such a shared and sensitive matter denies the Government itself that that confidence demands Yesterday President Ciriani and Vice President La Russa stated the contradictions contained in the request for a vote of confidence Our choice is compulsory and easy What I ask myself and ask you is your choice It is more difficult for you or at least it should be because I wonder what vote of confidence you are expressing For which government do you vote for trust you who are such diverse forces Which Government are you trusting To the Government that accepted without rewording it the incriminating agenda of Brothers of Italy and yet it is history Or to the government of Minister Di Maio who has not spoken and we do not know what you think Or to the government of Minister Guerini who sought a loophole with mathematics predicting the end of 2028 sure comes after 2024 for goodness sake What is the government you trust Is it the Count Government which increased military spending by 17 during your term of office What is the government you trust What says one thing and you deny the next day What is your government President Draghi has said well to you saying I shall conclude Madam President that if the commitments made at such a delicate time are called into question at the gates of Europe the majority pact will fail You must take note of this Yours is not a force of government it is a summation that is not a synthesis that does not have a foreign policy and that is full of contradictions

#RautiIsabella,"Mr President Mr President in Office of the Council members of the Government ladies and gentlemen the next European Council will discuss Russia 's military aggression against Ukraine the energy issue and the dependence of some European countries on imports of gas oil and coal from Russia We will also discuss the effects of the pandemic security and defence issues and as you Mr Draghi also mentioned the approval of the strategic compass It is on this particular subject that I am speaking The strategic compass after almost two years of gestation conceived therefore in times of peace is adopted in a dramatic moment that is in times of war It was approved by the Council of the European Union on 21 March and is expected to be formally adopted at the next European Council It is clear that this document takes into account the current geopolitical structure and the Ukrainian crisis However the document has a long term ambition and among its concrete objectives that of strengthening overall the security of the Union and outlining its strategic prospects for the next five to ten years in relation to the threats facing Europe No one escapes that the geopolitical framework is increasingly complex and that there are numerous outbreaks of instability and hybrid and unconventional threats In addition to the traditional crisis scenarios in the immediate neighbourhood namely the Western Balkans North Africa the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East to the eastern border of Europe we cannot forget the new tense scenarios in regions further away from Europe as well as the persistence of the terrorist threat In this increasingly complex international and global context Europe aims to strengthen its defence capacity and according to the compass it does so through four pillars action security investment and partners In a nutshell as the President in Office of the Council reminded us the process of action provides for the establishment by 2025 of a rapid deployment force of 5,000 units capable of operating in conflict scenarios in regions of interest to the European Union This rapid deployment corps is expected to be multinational inter force and multi-domain it is not a European army but a joint emergency unit The second area of the compass that of security provides specific attention to cyber domains and space which are increasingly subject to strategic competition and also provides for the strengthening of cybersecurity common intelligence capabilities as well as the adoption by 2023 of a space strategy for security and defence It is also expected to increase the capabilities of the National Armed Forces in disaster and emergency interventions in support of the civilian population The chapter on safety also provides for the coordinated expansion of the presence of European military navies on the key routes for the Union but also in the indopacific area in order to guarantee maritime safety and freedom of navigation The third pillar investment among other things commits States to increasing defence expenditure in order to fill some strategic gaps in national instruments and reduce technological and industrial dependence The investment chapter also provides for an increase in Community resources to be allocated to the European Defence Fund in the next multiannual budget of the European Union The final chapter of the compass is devoted to partnerships and underlines the commitment to be deepened and the political dialogue on security and defence issues at all levels multilateral regional and bilateral confirming at multilateral level cooperation with NATO and the UN but also as I recall with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE with the African Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations Overall the strategic compass thus provides the European Union with an action plan to strengthen its role in the field of continental and global defence and security in short a guide for action and a programmatic path towards common security in the five operational domains land sea air space and cyber The strategic compass represents for us a significant and important first step in the direction of a Europe of defence The European Union therefore assumes as the President in Office of the Council recalled a responsibility to become an actor capable of contributing to international security and to that of the European continent But let us repeat ladies and gentlemen that this is only a first step and the point is and will be to achieve and how to do so what has been established according to the time limits planned for 2030 We therefore reiterate that this is a first step or a step forward if you prefer to promote peace and stability and to ensure security and cooperation at European and international level However I would point out that this is certainly not the point of arrival for European defence We also believe that in the process which should lead to credible European security and in this we call the attention of the Government it is necessary for every step to involve the Italian Parliament in its competences It will be necessary in every step of implementation of the planned roadmap to defend national sovereignty If the strategic compass wants to represent a balance between Europeanism and Atlanticism pursuing the line of synergy between the European Union and NATO for Brothers of Italy in this direction no transfer of national sovereignty can be considered We also hope that this strategic instrument will have a strong positive impact on the entire national economy and in particular contribute to the technological and industrial development of the defence sector including I stress small and medium sized enterprises as well as in the field of security and airspace The political judgement on the strategic compass is conditional on what will be its real and progressive application it is also dependent on the forms of European coordination that it will be able to guarantee and I stress the role that Italy will be able to play in this renewed European context The issue is always about political division and not just about the aspects of defence because what really makes the difference is having or not having a common European foreign policy and never abdicating to the principle of the sovereignty of the nations It is also a question of guaranteeing European forces equal dignity in synergy with the allied forces Brothers of Italy ladies and gentlemen as you know does not support this today that the strategic compass is born and does not support it now that Europe is upset by a unilateral military attack put on the ground by the Russian Federation against Ukraine a free and independent sovereign state The same strategic compass also had to reconsider itself in the light of what happened in Ukraine and also its way of exercising a role as peacekeeper and as a security guarantor In short the European Union which is often so pervasive in the lives of the Member States even on matters such as nutrition DOC and PDO products the sick bollets of the nutritious score has proved to be absent and weak in some appointments with history As a political force Brothers of Italy has always criticized a fanatical European Union for being a bureaucratic and economic giant and for nothing worried about being a dwarf in foreign policy After 24 February everything changed and Europe will have to decide what to do when it grows up",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#RautiIsabella,Madam President on 26 November 2021 the so called Quirinale Treaty between the Italian Republic and the French Republic for enhanced bilateral cooperation between Italy and France was signed in Rome Today this Assembly is called as my colleague recalled to the ratification of this Treaty after the passages in the parliamentary committees and the approval in the Chamber last May with the vote against by Brothers of Italy The importance of this agreement is not under discussion here Indeed the Agreement is certainly very important and for this I would say it is likely to have serious consequences What we want to stress is a lack of method and some potential defects and also risks I would say of merit Meanwhile it is worth remembering that the idea of the Treaty was born in a bilateral summit of 2017 during the then PD Government of Gentiloni and the Italian left has never stopped since then to become spokesperson of the French interests in Italy while for Brothers of Italy the national interest is priority In fact while the Quirinale Treaty was being built France tried to implement unilaterally without any legal basis as the chronicle has shown to what we call the pirate Treaty of Caen which would have taken away precious territorial waters of course in favour of France A treaty which has fortunately never been ratified by Parliament as you know also thanks to the Brothers of Italy who has always denounced it and strongly contested it First of all this is a question of method because the signing of the Treaty was preceded by non-transparent or even secret negotiations and in any case without a preliminary discussion in Parliament In essence ladies and gentlemen the Treaty has been signed in absolute secrecy should we say so Then it was brought into the Commissions without particular emphasis as if it were a marginal act or mere formality However this is not the case because the Treaty provides for important commitments on equally important matters I mention only a few even for those who are not listening such as the space part which NATO has identified as the fourth domain and therefore an important area but also matters such as industry defence and climate policy provisions going through the issue of borders I stress this and migration issues I stress this to arrive at the non-marginal economic issues of trade which are also largely covered by this Understanding particularly Article 5 The French President Macron at the signing ceremony of the Treaty to the Quirinale seems to have pointed out that this Treaty filled the absence of an Italian French agreement similar to the 1963 Elysée Treaty agreed between Paris and Berlin President Macron forgot,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,18.114962,-0.5441942,30,madam president 26 november 2021 called quirinale treaty italian republic french republic enhanced bilateral cooperation italy france signed rome today assembly called colleague recalled ratification treaty passages parliamentary committees approval chamber last may vote brothers italy importance agreement discussion indeed agreement certainly important would say likely serious consequences want stress lack method potential defects also risks would say merit meanwhile worth remembering idea treaty born bilateral summit 2017 pd government gentiloni italian left never stopped since become spokesperson french interests italy brothers italy national interest priority fact quirinale treaty built france tried implement unilaterally without legal basis chronicle shown call pirate treaty caen would taken away precious territorial waters course favour france treaty fortunately never ratified parliament know also thanks brothers italy always denounced strongly contested first question method signing treaty preceded non-transparent even secret negotiations case without preliminary discussion parliament essence ladies gentlemen treaty signed absolute secrecy say brought commissions without particular emphasis marginal act mere formality however case treaty provides important commitments equally important matters mention even listening space part nato identified fourth domain therefore important area also matters industry defence climate policy provisions going issue borders stress migration issues stress arrive non-marginal economic issues trade also largely covered understanding particularly article 5 french president macron signing ceremony treaty quirinale seems pointed treaty filled absence italian french agreement similar 1963 elysée treaty agreed paris berlin president macron forgot
#RautiIsabella,Please Senator Rauti continue RAUTI FdI Thank you Mr President President Macron forgot to point out what appears however today even more as an anomaly of which everyone seems to have forgotten but we do not we refer to the Treaty of Aachen a sort of iron treaty that France signed with Germany in 2019 in particular on the issues of defence and he did so let us remember whistling away Italy the repercussions on Italy and also on the rest of the other European countries That too must be said Dear colleagues the feeling is that in Paris you like to receive white delegations and establish the rules of the game It is also for this reason that at least it is legitimate to doubt that Italy will not obtain great advantages from the subscription of this enhanced cooperation The supporters of the Italian French partnership the fanatics those whom someone with a neologism called the Dracron it is clear that neologism is born argue instead that it is a political instrument to overcome disagreements at European bilateral level It is a treaty marked by the desire to strengthen the core of the European Union thus building a strategic alliance between Paris and Rome I mean a lot of stuff looks like a bit of a dialect Brothers of Italy on the other hand believes and I come to the questions of merit that the Franco Italian Treaty determines and I do not use terms a subordination of our nation to France in extremely important areas such as those I have already mentioned while some were chatting but I also add in the financial agri food and of course political fields However the enhanced cooperation with France which we have signed coincides with a series of instrumental claims on borders that have no historical and legal basis A dramatic example is the long standing and unresolved issue of Mont Blanc on which France declares as if nothing were happening that it would lose the copy of the maps annexed to the Treaty of Turin of 1860 that it defined in an unequivocal way what the border line was It 's good to remind her of these things So ladies and gentlemen it continues to surprise us not only that such an important treaty has been studied and concerted in a non-transparent situation without a real political and parliamentary debate but also that this happens in the almost total silence of the media On the contrary we cannot hide some of our concerns such as immigration commitments because the bilateral agreement between Italy and France risks once again being penalised for our country which must become a refugee camp and the agreements of Malta teach something We are also very concerned about the repetition of the conduct of some French companies that have acquired at favorable conditions important productive realities of our country such as Parmalat Galbani Invernizzi Vallelata Locatelli to name but a few but I could continue proceeding then in some cases to the relocation of the activities with a great negative fall on the Italian employment induced and we can not be disinterested of this I should like to add and I shall conclude what has happened and could happen again in the banking sector where some French institutions have even shopped in Italy as the cases of BNP Paribas which has acquired the National Labour Bank and Crédit Agricole which has acquired Cariparma and Banca Popolare FriulAdria and unfortunately also in this case ladies and gentlemen I could continue Finally how do we vote for this enhanced cooperation with regard to the deep differences in the Libyan crisis with France not being scrupulous in overcoming Italy and going against the interests of our country I do n't know how you 're gonna put it But one thing I know and we know one thing is certain today and know it it will always be certain Brothers of Italy will watch over this and other treaties will always protect and will never give up in front of any form of transfer of national sovereignty,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#RautiIsabella,RAUTI FdI Mr President perhaps I do not share every single word of the motion but there are borders like this where we have to choose whether to wage a war of words or the battle of principles That is why I have decided to sign this motion with conviction on which the Extraordinary Commission for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights has worked giving priority to the battle in favour of certain principles With this preannunciation I vote in favour of the Brothers of Italy Group and I would like to say that in my speech I will remain adherent to the theme and motion because this is what we have to discuss today avoiding to get out of the topic also using polemics against other people and since I want to be on the subject I get there Today we take on a responsibility that is important because we officially condemn violence and rape in conflicts and we naturally do so by linking ourselves to a perimeter of a very robust and laboriously conquered international authorising character Obviously we are referring to the role of the International Criminal Court but also to the Geneva Convention to the Rome Statute and then to at least two fundamental and fortunately immortal resolutions of the United Nations Security Council No 1325 of 2000 and No 1820 of 2008 but I could also mention the following three follow up resolutions There is therefore an important and robust perimeter of international law fortunately to which we refer But beyond what is expected we come to the subject Let 's start with the assumption that rape is a weapon of war It has been historically and continues to be so in post modern conflicts Women in short as spoils of war from the rat of the Sabine to the Moroccans of the Ciociaria from the rapes in Sudan Sierra Leone Rwanda Liberia Congo Bosnia and Herzegovina to the victims of ISIS to the victims of Boko Haram until today 's Ukraine It is a practice that has been handed down for centuries a world of violence that has crossed and continues to cross the earth an infinite and cursed history that goes through time This is the hidden side of the war and I want to point out that it is also one of the greatest silences in history it is a black hole that has swallowed thousands of victims The difference is that today the women's and armed conflicts are not a business of women but it is a matter definitively included in human security policies with a strong impact also on international law on that perimeter to which I referred and to which the motion intends to contribute Return to the above mentioned UN resolution No 1325 Women peace and security which is considered for those who follow these issues the mother of successive and related resolutions because it is the first of the United Nations Security Council to deal explicitly with the impact of the war on women but also I stress this the important and fundamental role of women in the resolution of conflicts Women therefore are not only victims but also agents and peacemakers The strength of Resolution 1325 which is an important document and legal instrument is its innovative character because it gives us some basic indications on how to promote a culture that does not discriminate against women how to take all measures to prevent violence how to protect women who are victims of violence how to punish the perpetrators of crimes against women and how to compensate victims of violence The subsequent resolution No 1820 of 2008 thus marks a further step because it comes to linking sexual violence to a war tactic and recognizes the impact that sexual violence has in conflicts defining rapes and other forms of sexual abuse as a war crime and a crime against humanity as our motion also reiterates That is the point it is a crime against humanity Moreover there is the recognition of war rape as an instrument of ethnic cleansing and as a plan of genocide with a strategic and political purpose as a weapon and as a systematic tactic to destabilize terrorize humiliate force the abandonment of the territory reduce to obedience and submission and attention this weapon does not only concern women and children but can concern men and children reduced to slavery because there are many forms of violence For centuries rape and sexual violence have been considered a byproduct of wars they called it collateral damage suffered by women they called it an inevitable effect of conflicts We must overturn this perspective this ancient and cursed rite which has been renewed in modern and asymmetrical conflicts between non-state multidimensional actors in interstate guerrillas which have made these instruments even more violent and have gone even further to strike the civilian population It is against this phenomenon that we absolutely must condemn As Franco Algerinian scholar Karima Guenivet writes in her memorable book entitled Warworms Sexual violence as a new weapon Sexual violence is less and less a consequence of war and more and more a weapon used for the purposes of political terror the eradication of a group a plan of genocide and a will for ethnic cleansing The reality is dramatically this You see ladies and gentlemen this is yesterday 's weapon always and hopefully not tomorrow 's weapon which uses some winners against the losers who use some invaders against the invaders It is a form of bullying and has become a strategic weapon Violence on women and girls but also on men and children in short on the defeated and the invaded whatever the context is a horrendous form that must be condemned as an act that violates fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law and as an unqualified act when it also becomes a strategy of war This is the node now inescapable in international matters of human security women peace and security to restore to this dignity of international human law,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#RautiIsabella,Mr President when for the first time Brothers of Italy asked for a session of Parliament on national security the situation had not yet fallen Unfortunately the military aggression against Ukraine and the ongoing war have made today 's debate even more urgent necessary and dramatic What is happening demonstrates the importance both of the security of the Republic and of any decision taken not only in the field of defence but also in those of energy technology the digital economy and infrastructure Among the important issues of the report are European defence and national security assets that should be central to any political decision But it is on another fundamental aspect that I am speaking namely energy security which is a crucial part to be presided over within a comprehensive strategy to defend national interest and on which the report reiterates the need for strengthening in the terms of so called economic intelligence On the energy issue the Copasir presented last January a report to Parliament as President Urso recalled highlighting the criticalities of the system and the vulnerability both in the face of the hegemonic action of the state actors and the necessary ecological transition In the same report a number of solutions were also put forward which are fortunately the subject of urgent decrees or which are in the process of being evaluated The report clearly stressed the need to implement an energy security plan that would progressively reduce our dependence on other countries and especially on the Russian Federation aiming at energy independence and productive and technological autonomy in collaboration of course with Western European partners also in view of the geopolitical factors and risks that were being foreshadowed The report also states that The current scenario presents further weaknesses linked to the increase in prices in particular gas which has occurred in recent months and which is likely to mark the immediate future As we know unfortunately that was the case On these issues the Committee has indicated the need and urgency to adopt a national energy security plan aiming at an adequate technological and also productive autonomy of the country in the field of energy through the strengthening of national industrial and research chains Today ladies and gentlemen we are in a state of emergency and the situation could also lead us from here on I say it could to abandon Russia 's gas and oil in whole or in part and this is also one of the many dramatic consequences of the ongoing conflict but it is clear that today we are also facing mistakes of the past and wrong energy choices or not choices that have made us dependent on others and more vulnerable than other European partners We too will face the costs of sanctions especially as a result of the price of energy and that is why Brothers of Italy calls for action at European and international level so that costs are shared equally between the different European countries and the Western Alliance But it is not enough ladies and gentlemen Brothers of Italy believe that a plan of energy security is needed and that more energy must be produced in Italy with all possible instruments from the increase of the current gas production in the existing deposits to the new renewable energy plants a necessary combination to achieve the objective of energy independence without which we stress there can be no other kind of independence The ongoing war places the energy issue at the heart of global attention The surge in petrol and diesel prices is a reality with which we are all unfortunately accounting every day The same applies unfortunately to the generalized increases as it stretches we have had confirmation even today the shadow of the speculative spirals to be blocked to stop the escalation of the lists It is necessary to strike those who are jackaling on the tragedy of war as requested by Brothers of Italy also through a motion presented to the House In conclusion Mr President I must stress certain aspects of the report which I believe are of interest to this debate Energy is a social resource that is it is a universal right that should be guaranteed it is certainly also an environmental resource and it is a commodity but it should never become a weapon of geopolitical blackmail And yet it happens and it's happening It is for this reason ladies and gentlemen that we must have an energy policy that responds to the emergency and is able to plan the future as well But Italy must recover mistakes and delays because an energy policy is missing and lacking Meanwhile in order to face the emergency Brothers of Italy calls for an immediate reduction of excise duties and VAT on fuel costs Moreover I stress the reduction of the tax burden on fuels would not lead to any loss because these increases had not been estimated and represent a so called extra throw for the treasury chests We must immediately in our opinion correct the shot think about a strategy of energy independence because there are entire supply chains I do not mention them that risk stopping companies forced to close down or to reduce production Families are struggling to survive Even on the dear bills Brothers of Italy had launched already at the beginning of the year a cry of alarm and criticized a financial maneuver that provided for the increase only one and a half billion a clearly inadequate figure so much so that in January the Government had to intervene with other decrees to calm the bills but it is not enough as we have seen It would not be objective to attribute to the ongoing conflict everything that is happening in our economy because many crisis factors were already present in the last months of 2021 and the prices of all raw materials had already grown without the government in our opinion addressing the situation adequately The war has created a short circuit and we are chasing emergencies Ladies and gentlemen I would like to conclude by saying that today 's debate must help us find the necessary measures because Italians cannot support further sacrifices and do not deserve a Government that is still in the face of what was already an epochal socio-economic crisis that the consequences of the ongoing conflict are worsening dramatically launching new challenges hybrid and multidimensional threats,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,14.5973,-0.14074995,30,mr president first time brothers italy asked session parliament national security situation yet

#CanduraMassimo,Minister I can think of at first glance the phrase of the Chinese philosopher as well as leader Sun Tzu that is Know your enemy or at least your opponent The first consideration I make is of a geographical nature In the newspapers and even here we are talking about a Ukrainian front but Russia has a somewhat different vision For Russia the entire geographical arc that goes from the peninsula of Kola to the North Sea passes through Eastern Europe and arrives passing through the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the Middle East in the eastern Mediterranean is a single front from the security point of view I make this geographical consideration because it is news of Monday that the cruiser Ustinov as you will know sailed between Calabria and Puglia in the south direction parading in front of the military port of Taranto our base and then make route to Greece and probably to the eastern Mediterranean All these movements of submarines in front of the Ukrainian coast do not have a different military operational meaning than that of Russian submarines and military ships in the North Sea or the Mediterranean because it is all one operating theatre if we can say so The other geographical consideration I would like to make is that we are rightly talking about Ukraine in terms of violated sovereignty economic and social problems there are refugees dead and wounded but for Russia the problem is again a security issue All the invasions that the Russian people have historically suffered come from the West It is clear that Napoleon and Adolf Hitler are certainly not Europe today and they do not represent us in any way But psychologically the support of the Russian population to President Putin someone called him the tsar comes from this Encircling syndrome is not something theoretical or a whim of the newspapers but it is something felt within the Russian population And it is a very important factor if we want to democratize Russia And when we compare ourselves with it we have to take into account things of the vision of our competitor We do this in a relationship of friendship and we do it even when we fight we must know our enemy Then the fact that the precept comes from Asia know your enemy and in Europe Socrates said know yourself underlines again the diversity of vision of life and man between two cultures So in this vision we are also talking about the manifestation of intentions The recognition of the sovereignty and independence of these two Republics is a violation of Ukraine 's legitimate sovereignty Ukraine is not part of NATO but on 12 June 2020 Ukraine became an opportunity partner of NATO It is not a partner role in the sense of an ally but it is intended to ensure interoperability between the military systems of the partner country and the rest of the Alliance Clearly if I put myself from the Russian point of view as I have just said I can not see in this something aimed at peace and cooperation I am pleased it is a sacred principle that you have spoken about the principle of the open door NATO is open to all states that want to be part of it It is right that it should be open and it is right that Ukraine with a democratic government should be asked to be a part of it The NATO Russia Council I remember the 2003 Maritime Practice Summit had also begun a path that seemed extremely promising but not all the countries of the world agree even in the West with this vision which I share Here an Englishman who surely knows you helps us he is Halford Mackinder the great father of geopolitics who spoke of Heartland the heart of the Earth the Euro Asian continent Who controls the Eurasian continent which goes from Vladivostok to the shores of the Atlantic controls the world It is clear that the priority for those who are not part of this continent and do not control it becomes opposed to the fact that this immense mass unites and coagulates Hence the need for an enemy Russia and an West separated from Russia What I 'm saying is that democratization and friendship must be something that comes from both sides and not from one What Russia is doing in Ukraine is absolutely illegal from the point of view of international law sanctions are well come but they must have an effect on Russia and not on our citizens I 've heard of some kind of entrepreneurship sacrifice before Well see that a sacrifice for an entrepreneur Italian as from another country is not the sacrifice of a stranger the entrepreneur increases the prices of goods fires fails These are the reactions to such a crisis After that it is our citizens who pay Consequently I hope that the Italian State when the sanctions are declined will help those sectors of the Italian economy affected by the effects of these sanctions I would point out a second element historically speaking In 2014 sanctions were issued in particular in the agri -food sector I am Veneto that have hit the economic fabric of the North East of the country hard Russia at that time imported about 32 percent of foodstuff food materials from abroad Do you know what the reaction to sanctions was In 2021 they imported 12 percent we helped them to be autonomous The potatoes bought first in Central Europe are bought by Kazakhstan I do not know whether those sanctions have had the desired effect they have been disastrous to our economy In order to inspire good will to Russia and Putin I have more than a few doubts There is one thing I would like to stress the question of energy and the coordination of the European Union Minister France and Germany have two completely different energy mixes Germany is abandoning nuclear power and coal relying on gas for ecological transition as required by the taxonomy recently approved by the European Union France is continuing on nuclear power We can well understand that the energy strategy and the strategy towards Russia of these two countries cannot be compatible and cannot be compatible with ours either As a result talking about a common European Union strategy makes me a little smiling how can there be a common European Union strategy even in terms of energy I agree with you Minister we must equip ourselves to deal with crises not only from a geopolitical point of view but also on the demand and supply side But when we have a gas storage capacity across Europe of less than a fifth of the annual consumption where can we go This problem cannot be solved at all because renewable alternative energies will arrive in a few years time when we have solved the problems of energy accumulation and transmission with technology But energy is like the air we breathe we do n't need it in five ten or fifteen years but we need it right away So it is not right in my opinion to rely on tomorrow 's renewable energies to solve a problem that can strangle our economy today and that is simply because it is obvious Just see what is happening in Italy with the expensive bills which is linked to a price trend due to the geopolitical crisis and not only It would be desirable at European level to re-examine the pace of the ecological transition 2035 is approaching and not as a date of hope but as a threat I apologize if I had to stop for breathing problems Thank you Minister and I hope you will defend Italy,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#CanduraMassimo,Mr President I wish to greet the members of the Government all the honourable Members and all the Members present We have reached many points this evening but I would like to return to the root of the problem Today we are discussing this measure after Vladimir Putin 's government has decided to attack a sovereign state called Ukraine in a proditory and predatory way It is an invasion that has a bit broken the bubble of comfort in which we have lived for decades thinking that these kind of wars belonged to the past at least in our geopolitical quadrant in our area in our Europe No you do n't We have learned with dismay that an isolated state at international level that is not part of a strong alliance is prey to the strongest the most aggressive the most overbearing This leads us first of all to unequivocally condemn from the point of view of international law but also of ethics Vladimir Putin 's government for what it is doing in Ukraine But this also leads us to reflect on a conflict that has only appearance in the military dimension There is a very important political issue When we look at the countries of Eastern Europe we think of sovereign states precisely identified Poland Romania Ukraine itself But if we took the flight and looked from the Kremlin towards the West the vision on that side would not be that of sovereign states but of a security selfish and self centered dimension in a certain sense but understandable at a historical level and illegal and illegitimate under contemporary international law so Ukraine Poland and the Baltic countries do not have the right to choose independently which world to belong to whether to the world of Western democracies or to the sphere of autocracies They simply have to remain at the service of Russia 's security This political vision is absolutely irreconcilable We have a very serious problem which is not simply Russia 's aggression against Ukraine The problem is what we want to do with those principles that we have so far praised and that have proud us at least in words Can a sovereign state decide to join NATO and the European Union or should it be the bully of the neighborhood the referee of the international position of a democracy We as democracies are dependent on Russian gas a colleague of mine said it before and he is right and clearly we must choose whether we are people and countries of principle coherent or whether we must be merchants who sell their principles of freedom in the name of money when talking about the other person We are talking about spending on the defence of our country which is not simply the defence of our country but the defence of NATO and a political system If we do not think that peace which is not submission and freedom which is not anarchy are not discounted values but require sacrifice if we do not put this in our head I repeat it is much better that we close our countries close our parliaments close our defense expenses and give ourselves or sell ourselves to the first bullo of the neighborhood called Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping I recommend that you read the joint statement that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin signed on February 4 2022 twenty days before the invasion and the opening of the Beijing Olympic Games In this statement in addition to the strategic collaboration on various points that I am not here to outline because I do not have the time above all it is reinterpreted to the use and consumption of two dictatorships the concept of democracy saying that there are models and paths of democracy alternative to those that the West selfishly wants to impose on the world and that China and Russia have found their model of democracy because the Chinese and Russian peoples have chosen two non-democratic regimes Think of the circular reasoning democracy is that the people choose not to be governed democratically It is written very clearly and it is shocking I therefore call on those Members who rightly say that peace is a value I do not agree that peace is subjection I share peace but I also share the fact that we must be consistent in defending ourselves and our own principles and if someone among our electors ours in the sense of the whole hemicycle is not convinced of the goodness of military spending for the defense of the country that is for their defence it is our job to teach him to talk about it We cannot bend to fake news and to the propaganda of our opponents which exists because I repeat the policy of dictatorships that say that it is democracy to choose the dictatorship is antithetical to us We therefore have the responsibility not only to support the decree 2 and the action of the Draghi Government but we also have the task of making it clear

#FazzolariGiovanbattista,"President Draghi the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin recently declared that Russia wants to take back the territories that belong to it and return to its historical borders This means not only all the borders of the Soviet Union i.e. Ukraine Moldova the Baltic States and Georgia but if we know history also the Tsarist borders including Finland and part of Poland including Warsaw It is clear that Finland has been concerned and asks to join NATO and that Eastern Europe too is concerned because Putin has stated that he has aims on it Our concerns however do not end here because the Russian institutions have finally explained what they intend to denazize Ukraine They explained to us that Ukraine does not exist there is no Ukrainian nation there is no Ukrainian people there is no Ukrainian language But Nazi propaganda from 1990 onwards has created an anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalism and therefore now Russia with its special operation must re-educate the Ukrainians and make them understand that they do not exist and that they are Russian Now to us who are Westerners this seems absurd but to those who have grown up in communist regimes and are very familiar with rehabilitation centers all this seems normal and goes in that direction I am sorry to have to waste minutes to eliminate some fake news that runs on our media but unfortunately also within Parliament The war would be waged to stop the genocide in Donbass this is a Russian fake news repeated in Italy and also in Parliament Beyond the matter that the Donbass is not Russian because given to the hand 40 percent of the Donbass is inhabited by Russians the official numbers are the following and I challenge the Italian who usually watches our television to have this perception the civilian deaths in Donbass in 2021 were 25 in 2020 the civilian deaths were 26 in 2019 they were 27 So no genocide in progress and no genocide to stop Where do the 14,000 deaths we hear about come from These are mainly Ukrainian and pro-Russian fighters involved in the Russian invasion of the Donbass in a scheme we know and which Russia systematically repeats that is creating conflict zones in the states it claims it applies to Transnistria in Moldova Abkhazia South Ossetia in Georgia Donbass in Ukraine Russia simply wants domination over the territories it claims including Ukraine The problem is that the other states do not agree with Russia they disagree because Russia is not an attractive state Russia is a poor state and has a lower GDP than Italy despite having 145 million inhabitants It is a country that produces nothing and exports only raw materials like a third world country It is a country with huge income disparities with enormous corruption where Putin and his hierarchies show a billionaire wealth that is not well known where it comes from while 20 million Russians do not even have a bath in the house This is Russia and it is no wonder that Ukraine like the rest of Eastern Europe looks to the West and not to Russia But Russia instead of wondering why decides to intervene with tanks Luckily Ukraine resisted this invasion which according to any military analyst was to last a few days Russia has invaded Ukraine and Ukraine has amazed the world with a resistance that has never been seen before without the weapons it needs Also this lie repeated by certain journalists I do not know whether because paid by the Kremlin or because in bad faith and by certain political forces according to which Ukraine has already been sufficiently armed is denied by military analysts The Ukrainians fight with a piece of artillery every wind in possession of the Russians and with less range and less fire capacity Resistance is only due to the heroism of that people Ukraine is experiencing its Risorgimento fighting for its freedom and independence And we Italians that the Risorgimento lived it and that we transformed what others called only a geographical expression in our homeland should have an empathy towards that people and its Risorgimento But political choices are made not with empathy but with reason And the reason why we must support Ukraine has already explained to us the president of Fratelli d'Italia Giorgia Meloni and it is very simple because there lies the Italian national interest First Putin 's statements are already very clear if Ukraine capitulates quickly then it will be up to other European countries and to us as Brothers of Italy would not like the return of Soviet imperialism even in the third millennium Secondly very pragmatically it is not Italy that decides the fate of the war in Ukraine there is a surreal debate as if the Italian weapons were fundamental to decide whether Ukraine can resist or not Well even if Italy were to betray its international alliances the United Kingdom the United States Australia Japan all the rest of the West would continue to defend Ukraine It would not change therefore the fate of the war but would change the image and credibility of Italy in the world making it fall back into that image of a country that is not reliable as it has often been painted

#FazzolariGiovanbattista,Minister thank you for being here We as a force of patriotic opposition will not make presumptuous attacks today but we will try to make our contribution Thank you very much if you will listen carefully to me despite the desolation of an empty Chamber when we talk about issues such as these as a witness to a West which is inadequate to meet certain challenges First of all I want to represent my personal closeness and that of Brothers of Italy to the many Ukrainians and Russians who live in Italy and who at this moment live with great apprehension what is happening regardless of the responsibilities of its Governments A thank you goes to our diplomats and our officials in Kiev and a thank you to you Minister for leaving the embassy open it is an important sign of presence which repeats itself after what has already been given in Afghanistan and which gives lustre to our nation With all due respect however I must say that we would have preferred a more experienced foreign minister to face a crisis like this You said that you had been confronted with Minister Lavrov a diplomat since before you were born a person of enormous depth You are an intelligent and prepared person and you will agree with me that in a context like that maybe a Third Giulio Di Sant Agata or Ambassador Vattani or others with the same standing as Lavrov would have been more appropriate Unfortunately the government of the best beyond the name it has given itself has chosen its boxes according to other logics and then we pay it in contexts like this Italy arrives unprepared and even worse the European Union arrives unprepared once again bureaucratic giant geopolitical nano and internationally What happens in Ukraine is also a child of European weakness In this context clarity is important and then I want to say straightaway that the Brothers of Italy supports an Italy fully part of the Western bloc fully part of the Atlantic Alliance without ambiguity Ours is not a tactical choice or a choice of convenience it is the awareness of being part of a Western world with common roots common philosophical visions son of the classical and Christian roots of Europe which belong to Europe and to all countries of European culture This is our belonging to the West We have never looked at China the Islamic monarchies of the Gulf Russia our choice of field is clear and clear In the same way we have always supported respect for international law aware that it is the only instrument to prevent the outbreak of wars and conflicts and also for a reason of opportunity international law defends the least powerful States and unfortunately for a long time Italy and Europe are not among the superpowers of this planet Therefore all the more so Italy and Europe must forcefully and always uphold international law We were however easy prophets when on the occasion of the war in Serbia for Kosovo we said that we were creating a dangerous precedent Solving a crisis although very serious and bloody by redesigning the borders of one European State would have been a precedent used by others in Europe And that is exactly what Russia is doing quoting the Kosovo case when it comes to redesigning borders to resolve an armed conflict situation With the same clarity however we are wondering whether NATO and the West have made the most appropriate progress so far If we have arrived from the 2002 Maritime Practice Agreement with a proximity between NATO and Russia to a war situation at our doorstep something has been wrong It 's a fact The goal according to Brothers of Italy but I believe it is a goal shared by all Europeans is to achieve a definitive peace between Europe and Russia for a number of reasons In order to achieve this ambitious objective we must be able to reconcile two very different needs on the one hand the needs of the Eastern European countries rightly concerned by Russian imperialism which they have known over and over again in history and last but not least freed themselves from the Soviet yoke only in 1990 From a historical point of view it means yesterday It is clear therefore that these countries are worried and frightened We should remember the debt we owe to the countries of the East which we have given to the communist dictatorship in exchange for our freedom when with too much simplicity we attack Poland Hungary and the Visegrad bloc If they are lagging behind in democracy perhaps it is because we have handed them over to the Soviet bloc for half a century It is an even more important speech for Ukraine Putin has made a long historical reconstruction partly true of the proximity between the two peoples He however failed to remember a historical event Mr. Minister if you listen to me maybe it 's more useful to all of us,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,11.417376,0.13087302,30,minister thank force patriotic opposition make presumptuous attacks today try make contribution

listen maybe 's useful us
#FazzolariGiovanbattista,"FAZZOLARI FdI And we are very happy with the Presidency 's firm vigilance Putin has made a long historical reconstruction partly true of the relations between Russia and Ukraine of the relations between two very similar peoples He however failed to mention the painful parenthesis of the relationship between these two peoples first of all that of the Ukrainian genocide the holodomor the genocide by hunger that Soviet communists imposed on Ukraine in the 1930s to bend it to the new Bolshevik model This too must be remembered when we talk about Russia and Ukraine On the other hand however there is a superpower calling for guarantees on its own safety In this respect unfortunately we have given rise to Russian concerns We won the Cold War thanks to Reagan 's space shield which was partly a bluff but which worked We were able to strike the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union was unable to strike the West This led to an arms race by the Soviet Union which the Soviet economy did not hold and therefore suffered a collapse precisely because of the space shield announced by Reagan Today we want to do more We want to be able to have a NATO structure that makes Russia offensive that is that we can hit its vital cities before Russia has the time to react Now we are not referees in this game we are biased We won two to zero the Cold War If we can win six to zero we 're happy eight to zero ten to zero we agree as long as we do n't do two to two and lose two to three and that 's our concern Are we sure we can make an offensive power that has 6,500 atomic warheads and 145 million inhabitants which is the largest state in the world from a geographical point of view If we 're sure fine We are not so sure for a number of reasons firstly it is the power of Russia as we have already said secondly Russia has already given signs that it was not prepared for certain concessions He did so in Georgia with a situation very similar to that of Ukraine Georgia in the process of joining NATO was militarily occupied by Russia and the West did not react The third most serious reason was the sign of weakness of the West and in particular of the Biden administration Let 's talk about numbers Minister which if we reason together may be useful perhaps even in some international conversation Biden has announced to its public opinion and to the whole world that 3,000 American deaths in 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan were a cost in terms of lives too high to bear so much so that it led to a disorderly and shameful withdrawal from Afghanistan I repeat 3,000 dead in 20 years The Ukrainians in a war defined at low intensity in a few years had 14,000 deaths in the Donbass these are the relationships All experts estimate that any earthly conflict even with conventional weapons would lead to tens of thousands of deaths in a matter of days So how does the West at the same time say that it is not willing to bear a cost of 3,000 deaths in twenty years and make it believe that it would be willing to have 50,000 deaths in a few days That 's how we exposed ourselves to the Russian reaction with an incompetent American administration We have to have the strength to say it With Trump it would n't have happened and I do n't say it but many people in the United States say it today Trump would n't lend his side to this weakness Let 's talk about the Americans who are the ones who always do much of the work for the West And if we want to talk about the West we 're even worse off A Europe impoverished by the Covid which imposes the obligation of vaccination and to walk around with masks and with the green pass with what credibility does it talk about war Do you go to the front with the FFP2 and respect the social gap Let 's be credible On the front line and with the green pass of course we then lend our support to those who think they can bully the West In this context Europe is always inadequate Minister I ask you to officially protest on behalf of Italy with Borrell responsible for European foreign policy who is allowed to make idiots tweets saying that with sanctions no shopping in Milan for the Russians People are dying there people are fighting there and we have a clown who says no shopping in Milan Is this the reaction of the West I ask you to make Italy 's voice heard When Europe speaks of a dramatic

#FazzolariGiovanbattista,FAZZOLARI FdI If you bothered to find out about the history of our Group you would know that we are not afraid of the responsibility of saying pagliaccio to someone Speaking of inadequate management of certain contexts Minister Di Maio in 2019 I submitted a parliamentary question addressed to you because it included Ukraine among the safe states of origin of illegal immigrants This means that the Ukrainian person found without a residence permit could be taken and sent back home because the country was safe while there was a war I asked her how it was possible for the Ukrainian carer without a residence permit to be sent back to Ukraine where there was war and she did not include Pakistan Egypt Nigeria Ivory Coast Bangladesh where there are no wars Well let us try to live our eastern borders even more seriously if there is war in Ukraine Ukraine is not a safe country or in Ukraine there is no war and then it is a safe country but it cannot say the two things at the same time I therefore ask you on the other hand to remove Ukraine from the list of safe countries in order to avoid repatriating Ukrainian caregivers and perhaps including Pakistan so that we can return those who illegally land on our coasts without having any title In conclusion it is right to make every effort to work for peace Europe has few weapons at its disposal including sanctions if the sanctions hit Russia more than they hit us otherwise they become mockery for everyone first of all for the Ukrainians and for those who support that situation Moreover support for Eastern European countries once again threatened by Russian imperialism just with the alleged attacks on the Visegrad blockade condemnation of the violation of international law by Russia for the recognition of the separatist Republics of the Donbass a plan of energy autonomy of the European Union because we can talk about what we want about bad Russia but then from Russia we have to buy gas otherwise we turn off the light in our homes And above all we must respect the commitment of the parameter of 2 of NATO 's military spending we continue to speak of the Atlantic Alliance and of NATO membership but Brothers of Italy is the only party that has always paid the electoral cost and of unpopularity to say that it is not spared on military spending that freedom has a cost and that cost is the ability of a people to defend themselves There is the 2 of GDP parameter for each NATO Member State which Italy continues to systematically fail to respect And precisely because of a situation of tension we ask at least that already in the next financial law we expect to respect the parameter of 2 of GDP As true Europeans we care about this Europe We have at heart the peace and the borders of Europe once again endangered by the inadequacy of this European Union Once again the Confederal model supported by the European Conservatives chaired by Giorgia Meloni namely a model with a Europe

#BalboniAlberto,Mr President I would like to outline the agenda for the first time signed by all the members of the Fratelli d'Italia Group As has already been pointed out during the general debate this Treaty the so called Quirinale Treaty brings together agreements between Italy and France in various areas and among them in the field of justice In particular Article 4 of the Treaty which is referred to as Migratory policies justice and home affairs stipulates the joint commitment I quote to deepen cooperation between the respective judicial authorities and to ensure constant coordination in accordance with the prerogatives of the judicial authorities Well as you know on 29 June last the French judicial authority the Paris Court of Appeal decided to deny the extradition requested by Italy of ten communist terrorists refugees in France after committing very serious crimes in Italy and having left behind an endless trail of blood There was an expectation on the part of the victims and of all Italians who have not forgotten what the years of lead have meant for Italy what it meant for Italy to imperish for years and years for decades of murderous criminals who put themselves behind false political justifications while committing serious common crimes rapes murderers kidnappings in person what it meant for Italy for our homeland to go through those truly difficult years It was therefore hoped that thanks also to the commitments made by President Macron towards Italy and the arrests finally carried out in 2021 after decades of impunity in Paris we could close this tragic page of the national history of the lead years obviously through the application of justice On the other hand unfortunately many years later the Mitterrand doctrine prevailed once again which tries to justify these crimes in some way behind a false screen of their politically inspired nature Moreover from what is learned from the press and from the comments of these days it seems that the French judicial authority has even called into question referring to the European Convention on Human Rights the fact that Italy has guaranteed a fair trial for these accused Well there is no guaranteeing country as much as Italy there is no trial that respects the rights of the accused more than it does in Italy above all with regard to the humanitarian question or such claim since we also cite the precarious health conditions of some of these defendants there is no penitentiary system that guarantees endless rights to prisoners such as the Italian one It is really ridiculous to think that in France someone imagines that a prisoner in serious health in Italy does not have all the protection that humanitarian principles recognize to people in these conditions I would like to remind you that this very Government has also recognized the detention of dangerous mobsters with health conditions certainly not as serious as those that seem to concern at least one of the arrested in Paris It therefore sounds paradoxical ladies and gentlemen that on the one hand France wants to sign with Italy a commitment to greater cooperation in the field of justice and at the same time want to continue to guarantee impunity to these criminals It is clear that Italy must react in the strongest possible way to this injustice It is clear that in compliance with the judicial authority and the principle of the division of powers Italy cannot confine itself to a simple manifestation of disappointment or dissension but must firmly pose an essential issue Criminal refugees in France must not enjoy any impunity they must not enjoy any immunity Those applauses in that Chamber when the Court of Appeal of Paris read the sentence are an outrage to the entire Italian people and to the feeling of justice not only of the victims but of all Italians who believe in the Italian judicial system even with its limitations and its defects because of perfection everything is there and of perfect nothing can be considered Of course however Italy has nothing to learn in terms of guarantees from a country like France Then we will talk about what France does with regard to immigrants arriving through Ventimiglia about how France behaves towards people who would be entitled that is to humanitarian aid and who instead rejects even if they are minor For these reasons we have proposed the G100 agenda and we trust that the Government can To welcome him,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,18.46377,0.3624401,30,mr president would like outline agenda first time signed members fratelli

#BalboniAlberto,Balboni FdI Mr President Mr Casini my colleague from Fratelli d'Italia was the same and I thank him for his appreciation of the arguments I thought I had put forward by presenting our agenda which was accepted by the Government which of course is greeted by the whole of the Fratelli d'Italia Group with great support However for the very reason that you pointed out earlier we will vote against this Treaty because the question is precisely what you put Mr Casini the role of France the role of Germany the role of Italy The Europe we know today was born around these three poles We are founding partners of Europe with equal dignity together with France and Germany Ladies and gentlemen the real issue that arises today on the ratification of this Treaty is precisely this what is the role that Italy is given in relation to France and Germany France and Germany have concluded an iron treaty the Treaty of Aachen with which they have undertaken to agree first among themselves the line to be taken within the European Union Italy was placed in an ancillary and subordinate position Then we of Brothers of Italy as you know colleagues Brothers of Italy always have exclusively as a point of reference first of all the national interest wonder why when Italy signs such an important Treaty with France it does not put on the mat the theme of the role that Italy must assume towards France and Germany We would have liked the subject of the Treaty of Aachen to be raised before we signed this Treaty Europe cannot walk on two legs but it must walk on three legs Italy is a founding partner of the European Union and has nothing less than France and Germany at least for our irreplaceable strategic role in the Mediterranean So why are we ratifying a treaty today that establishes our subordinate role vis-à vis France and Germany and on the contrary transforms France into the guarantor of Italy vis-à vis Germany The things that matter are decided by Germany and France after which France comes to explain what the line is It can't and does n't have to work like this Brothers of Italy understand that the subordination to France is almost in the DNA of the Democratic Party of the center left of the left wing democratic tradition of which today President Casini is interpreter and in general of the other part of the hemicycle it is enough to see the relationship that the Democratic Party has always had with Macron and with France in general There is no one among us who has the Legion of Honor I believe instead that the MPs of the Democratic Party with the Legion of Honor count to dozens between Chamber and Senate That is a difference ladies and gentlemen we do not have the Legion of Honor you do When you have to choose between national interest and good relations with France choose the second We do n't You in the face of operations such as that of Lactalis for example which bought the entire Italian food chain have had a benevolent and condescending attitude We do n't When France nationalized its shipyards to prevent Fincantieri from buying them you sketched them out We are not dear colleagues of the Democratic Party When BNP Paribas as my colleague Mrs Rauti mentioned earlier bought important Italian banks it was good for you once again Woe to the world however in case of the purchase of a French company by an Italian company in this case the barricades were raised because the French their national interest can do it very well We should learn from them as well as from Germany of course The same story Stellantis ended as it ended and we know very well that also in this case the role as protagonist was certainly not reserved for the Italian part That is why we are convinced that if a treaty were to be made it would have to be put on a different footing As Mr Casini mentioned earlier in fact Italy 's national interest was certainly not that of France in the Libyan affair What happened in Libya against the Gaddafi regime did not happen for humanitarian reasons or to defend civil rights it happened because France was annoyed by the privileged economic relationship that the Italian Government of which you were a member at the time Mr. Undersecretary had managed to establish with the Gaddafi regime which was certainly not democratic like so many others with whom the West does not have problems maintaining and encouraging economic relations Even today France supports a part which is not the part of freedom and democracy it supports General Haftar who is certainly no less dictatorial and more democratic than Gaddafi As for migration policy how can we hide the unqualified behavior in this case yes in violation of the basic humanitarian rights that France holds in Ventimiglia sending back even minors qualifying them for adulthood even if they are obviously thirteen fourteen and fifteen years old children or sending back migrants taking off their shoes If Italy did such things what would happen The UN would come if we behaved like France does to migrants trying to cross the Italian French border So ladies and gentlemen we are voting no for all these reasons and above all because the true bipolarism that is being affirmed not yet in this House reflecting numbers that no longer exist in reality but in the country among Italians is that between a Democratic Party subordinate to the French interests and Brothers of Italy that as Giorgia Meloni says is the real and only guarantor of national interest,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#BalboniAlberto,Balboni FdI Mr President I would like to ask the Government to report urgently to the House on the scandalous decision taken today by the French court on the request for extradition of criminal terrorists who had been arrested for serious terrorist offences committed in Italy including the murder of Calabresi This is a scandalous decision which contradicts in a shameful way the much warned Quirinale Treaty which I would like to remind you had a paragraph specifically devoted to cooperation in the field of justice between France and Italy Italy cannot tolerate that after forty years These criminals and murderers continue to enjoy substantial immunity in the name of the so called Mitterrand doctrine which we as Italians hoped imagined and believed was finally archived These criminals must pay their debt with Italian justice I believe that we must all express our full solidarity with the families of the victims and we must demand that justice follow its course without favorable treatment in respect of an ideology that has marked a path of blood years of lead that the Italians want to forget so that we can really turn the page however justice must be done I therefore ask on behalf of the Brothers of Italy Group that the Government immediately report on this very serious incident and on the initiatives it intends to take at diplomatic level with France so that this decision can be challenged and annulled,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,18.532784,0.6224124,30,balboni fdi mr president would like ask government report urgently house scandalous decision taken today french court request extradition criminal terrorists arrested serious terrorist offences committed italy including murder calabresi scandalous decision contradicts shameful way much warned quirinale treaty would like remind paragraph specifically devoted cooperation field justice france italy italy cannot tolerate forty years criminals murderers continue enjoy substantial immunity name called mitterrand doctrine italians hoped imagined believed finally archived criminals must pay debt italian justice believe must express full solidarity families victims must demand justice follow course without favorable treatment respect ideology marked path blood years lead italians want forget really turn page however justice must done therefore ask behalf brothers italy group government immediately report serious incident initiatives intends take diplomatic level france decision challenged annulled
#LunesuMichelina,LUNESU L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is an honour for me as a Sardinian to commemorate on behalf of the League a great protagonist of Italian politics Enrico Berlinguer a man destined to become a protagonist of the democratic life of our country He was certainly if not the greatest the most beloved secretary of the greatest western communist party A hundred years after his birth as well as remembering who he was and what he did it is important to reflect on what remains of political action of his ideas of his progressive drive with which he dealt with current issues Dolce Enrico sang Antonello Venditti if I were still there the world changes the only thing that remains is a more true injustice He fought against injustice The political idea that animated Berlinguer was permeated with absolute integrity ideal intransigence constant and tenacious attention to the general interest and public good deep and unwavering convictions that led him to raise the great theme of morality in politics and to see without fear before others what was happening in the deepest folds of our country the degeneration of public life the spread of occult powers the hypertrophy of the party system and the transformation of some of them into pure instruments of consensus and power It was the man who could trace a furrow between Italian and Soviet communism when with extreme courage in the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union PCUS in 1976 he performed that rift by uttering words such as democracy and pluralism which earned him the cover of the Time and the hatred of Soviet orthodoxy Enrico Berlinguer had the courage to support his ideas moving for the good of the country superior to that of his own party to seek the agreement with Aldo Moro in the historical compromise which was stopped only by the assassination of the leader of the DC but not only also to meet several times the secretary of the Italian Social Movement heir of fascism to understand together how to save the Republic from red and black terrorists Berlinguer 's thought was a long thought working for peace always and anyway pacifism today as it was then is exchanged as partisan for a political force while it must be remembered that working for peace is our duty Speaking of the future he said that you are saved and you go forward if you act together and not just one by one Indro Montanelli described him as an introverted and melancholic man of immaculate honesty always struggling with a demanding lonely conscience of spontaneous habits more troubled than enticed by the perspective of power and in perfect good faith Of him remains a social program a political program economic ethical and moral unwritten fundamental for the democratic future and progress of our country It is the capacity for long term analysis that would historically make him a prophet in the desert compared to the political cultural offer of the 1980s The moral question highlights the profoundly political nature inherent in the question of representation Berlinguer would have been among the first to understand that the superb occupation of the state gangs by the parties was opening a gap between the political class and civil society It is important to emphasise Berlinguer 's attention to sensitive issues such as the limited resources and environmental compatibility its reflection on the potential good and bad uses of new technologies the strong sensitivity shown to the gap between North and South of the world the understanding of the need to tackle globally the upcoming challenges of the new millennium He was a leader able to openly question a model of society centered on the profit and the intensive exploitation of resources a leader able to indicate new trajectories of social progress in the context of the end of the twentieth century with the awareness of the need for change and at the same time the attempt to coincide continuity and transformation tradition and innovation In some moments the first characteristics constraints and limits that came from an identity its history and its time prevailed but in most cases it shone its ability to look far away to produce the accelerations it felt necessary,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,6.741854,0.0054188273,30,lunesu l sp psd az

#SaponaraMaria,SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen when we think of Giacomo Matteotti we think of a free man a politician who was not afraid to denounce fraud and fascist violence during the April 1924 elections paying for this act of courage with his own life At the end of the famous speech given to the Chamber of Deputies in May of the same year the politician was aware that that courage would lead him to die and it was precisely so The secretary of the then United Socialist Party will be kidnapped and found dead on August 16 in a forest about thirty kilometers north of the capital Kill me too but the idea that is in me you will never kill her these were the words spoken by Giacomo Matteotti in the last speech to the Chamber words that animated and gave strength to the powerful desire for freedom of the opponents of fascism so much so that during the Resistance the Socialist Party will constitute the Matteotti brigades in which he participated as leader Sandro Pertini The example that Giacomo Matteotti left to the next generations was very powerful For this reason it is important to continue to remember his actions and his thought so as not to disperse his inheritance The bill of celebration has not only a historical value but also helps to keep alive the memory of a fundamental figure in Italian political life but above all an emblem of freedom Of freedom unfortunately one appreciates the importance only when one loses it otherwise one takes it for granted as a work of art that by virtue of having it before his eyes is not appreciated In recent years our freedom has been severely put to the test first by the pandemic which has locked us in the house and then has forbidden us any social and even work activities now by the war in Ukraine which makes us witness impotent overwhelmment among peoples even on live television An infamous war that kills women and children and leaves everything around the desert of destruction while we are forced to hear truths of convenience in countries where it is impossible to express one 's own free thought It is an almost unreal and incomprehensible situation if one thinks of all the initiatives promoted after the last world war so that certain things do not happen again so that the memory of heinous facts and history teach us not to decay into war and violence anymore The content of this bill must also be a warning to us not to fall into the same mistakes not to stifle the freedom of others This is why today it is very important and necessary to continue to keep alive the memory of figures like that of Giacomo Matteotti a giant of freedom that fought against the violence and the overpowering dictatorship so that the new generations but also we could live without being oppressed by power and fully savour the scent of freedom I thank the proposer of this bill the President of the 7th Commission all the signatories and all the members of the Commission and with this announcement the Lega

#RomeoMassimiliano,ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President the League will vote for the government and if it had not been placed it would still have voted for the measure in our examination because our position is clear according to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter Ukraine has the right duty to defend itself The Italian Government has a duty to lend all the necessary help to the Ukrainian people including military aid also respecting and this is something we must remember the Atlantic Pact Therefore it is right to respect international agreements because a common European defence is necessary not only for greater European integration but also and above all as a deterrent effect for those that can be present or future attacks This is crucial The League at the same time unlike others has asked to moderate its tones Why The world is currently walking on a thin red line that can plunge us into an escalation of conflict and lead us to World War III Therefore we must give the words that are spoken and be very careful about the actions that we want to take this is why we said to moderate the tones It made us smile a bit 'a certain warlike fury perhaps from some characters also from the press someone defines them as the warriors living room the warriors sofa in short those who perfectly follow the Italian tradition synthesized in the phrase Armiamomi e parti Let us return to our natural beehive which is that of diplomacy this is the word we used We want to see an Italy that is at the forefront on the diplomatic front and we are pleased that President Draghi and the Government have taken this initiative Premier Draghi's phone call with both Zelensky and Putin was absolutely important The premier said we want to talk about peace The aim is the negotiation that must yes lead us to an agreement which will then have international guarantees but that is the way forward Therefore the government does what is right and that is contained in this decree- law but on the other hand push its action as it is doing also and above all on the diplomatic front It is right to help refugees and here too the decree contains important measures for the most part they are women and children fleeing from bombs let it be clear and therefore it is right to help them Indeed in this regard as a League but together with all the forces of majority we have asked and obtained there is a precise commitment of the Government that on unaccompanied minors in order to meet the needs of the mayors the State takes full responsibility for the expenses precisely to help the smaller municipalities Moreover we ask the Government it is a commitment that will mainly concern the next decrees starting from the so called price cut decree that there be the will to help also our families and our enterprises That 's the point Among the headlines of some of today 's newspapers is Small and medium sized companies with gas barrels and we talk about expensive energy and expensive fuel we cannot think and we say this to the Government with all due respect that the fuel discount can last thirty days It must be extended It must be extended We cannot think that we can't help some businesses that are closing down because they can't stand up anymore Last time we talked about the middle class many families in crisis Yesterday there was a statement that many people can't even pay their bills anymore because they do n't have the money and they do n't pay them We must make an intervention but the government objects that the Ministry of Economics and Finance of money are not there because everything that could be collected was collected for the decree energy in the House and for the price cut in the Senate Well we understand this We must then intervene with the European Union to allow the Member States of Europe to make the budgetary deviation because we cannot but give resources to our economy unless we want to shut down businesses and put the vast majority of our people into poverty I do not think that is the objective of the European Union So all the more so we must insist on the willingness to find these resources As we said everything that has been done is right The measures that the government has put in place to support our families are also good but knowing that they are not enough more needs to be done It is the commitment that we are asking the Government and with this we reaffirm our vote in favour of the confidence and the measure under consideration,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,9.421319,3.0142357,30,romeo l sp

#RomeoMassimiliano,Mr President Mr President in Office of the Council distinguished Ministers and Undersecretaries ladies and gentlemen there is no doubt that democracy and freedom are at stake in this conflict as the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni has reminded us very well However we must also be careful to ensure that this freedom which is put in danger from the outside is also defended inside because unfortunately too often it happens that it is enough to deviate from a minimum very little from the dominant thought from the mainstream and politically correct to be immediately accused of complicity with the enemy ambiguity and being bearers of hatred and anything else As if it were forbidden to advance a but to pose a doubt to try to reason to seek the so called right means that has made over the centuries a bit the history of our country of our culture Why do I say that Because we have seen it in recent years it happens a little across the West Mr President when it comes to certain issues from gender policies to immigration to Covid and also on the subject of war woe to deviate from what is the dominant thought It is enough to say and to say that we must dialogue with Russia not in order to make its interest but in a functional way to open negotiations which must obviously be between two parties and must also include Russia in order to be immediately accused of pointillism rather than anti-Europeanism and so on Now thankfully since both Macron and Scholz have said that we need to talk to Putin at least we have knocked down this politically correct wall and we understand we know this that it is not so much what is said in the substance but who says it and especially how it says it I quote another example namely a statement by the Secretary of the Democratic Party Enrico Letta who a few days ago let go of a thought that I personally absolutely share better an imperfect peace than war It is almost had to run to the shelter not to deny but at least to correct that it was just a quote and that there is no change of line This kind of attitude says a lot about what are the real possibilities of being free to express in a Parliament and in the country what are legitimate opinions You can be absolutely convinced of Europeans Atlanticists and consider the most powerful weapon of diplomacy Since I mentioned the speech of the most powerful weapon there is no doubt that if we had not provided military aid and support to Ukraine especially in the first part of the conflict it would have been difficult to bring Russia to the negotiating table because it would have won the war in two weeks and probably decided to invade some other country as well So it is absolutely true and important what has been done and it has been voted in a resolution It is also true that in view of the fact that this is a conflict of some depth which risks I say this by quoting a journalist uncontrollable waves it would be just as good for this military support to continue in the context of the legitimate defence of the Ukrainian people just as we voted in the resolution of 1 March being careful that self defense does not in turn become aggression That 's what we 're asking for Are we saying something scandalous No in our opinion we are simply saying what most people call common sense what we are talking about when we also want to discuss these issues without necessarily being geopolitical experts In the same way it is equally true this certainly that we must not divide the West It is clear that the West must not be divided especially at the level of public opinion we would play the game of the enemy Putin I repeat there is no doubt about this Of course it is all true however in order to avoid playing the game of our enemy there remain essentially two open paths to follow which you Mr Draghi together with the other Heads of State will have to discuss in the European Council The first is that the international community the European Union NATO all possible states that can stand in the way of trying to resolve the conflict separate aggressor and attacker and both commit themselves to a negotiated peace immediate with a ceasefire This is the path we prefer and which we expect but if it is not possible and should instead continue according to NATO alarms an extension of the war because someone claims that Putin will lose and that Ukraine 's victory will certainly not go through a ceasefire if the war really lasts for a long time then the European Union and all the institutions should start to think that we must intervene very seriously to support our economic fabric made by small and medium sized entrepreneurs All this to protect the purchasing power of workers and pensioners given the increase in inflation to compensate for the imbalances resulting from the sanctions applied to Russia which certainly hurt Russia as the President in Office of the Council says but also to us let us not forget that We must face the food crisis something that the President of the Council himself has highlighted At this moment then there are emergencies on which we must intervene quickly we must declare the state of calamity for the obvious drought that is hitting our country and not only We need to act quickly to ensure an energy independence as soon as possible not dependent on others 750 wells are still and must be reactivated immediately regardless of the parties of the no which unfortunately in this country have caused the ruin on many sectors and on many fronts We need to stop migratory flows and on this point it is only the Government you chaired Mr President in Office of the Council that shines particularly there is a 30 increase even in the light of the risks associated with the food crisis Speculation must be stopped and in this respect the idea that you have launched on the price cap then on the roof at the price of gas but not only on that All this however must be done quickly because we cannot allow workers to begin to lose their jobs that our manufacturing industry begins to close its doors that our economy faces degradation and a complete débâcle because in the face of a social and economic degradation there would be disturbances that would lead public opinion not only of Italy but of the whole of Europe and of the whole of the West to divide and in that case we would play the game of our enemy Putin Europe therefore knows that if war lasts for a long time because this is the road that must inevitably be taken if there are no other solutions it must intervene and when one is in a war economy as President Macron has explicitly stated there are two roads or taxes are being increased but we do not want to go this way and the President of the Council said that it would never increase them or public debt is being increased but Europe does not seem to have understood much seeing the latest recommendations from the European Commission We must move in this direction We understand that in the end the decisions are taken by you Heads of State and Government with the relevant Ministers in the European Council then there will be the G7 Summit in Bavaria and the NATO Summit in Madrid It is you who make the decisions indeed often let me say this I do not only do it on a controversial issue it does not seem that Parliament gives the direction to the Government but in some cases it seems that the Government gives the direction to Parliament and unfortunately this happens not only in Italy but also in other European countries Since you decide this time we tell you to hurry I do not know if he remembers it hurry because there is not only the risk that peace is seriously drifting away but also that soon the air conditioners will not work

#RomeoMassimiliano,ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President President in Office of the Council members of the Government ladies and gentlemen in the context of just and proper support for the Ukrainian people from a humanitarian and economic point of view as well as for military aid which you and your Government are pursuing we are allowing ourselves to give you a suggestion Mr Draghi We ask you to use a little more calm in some circumstances because on some occasions they were too belligerent or at least they were perceived as such the population gets scared and we think that public opinion should be reassured On the other hand at a stage like this public opinion is absolutely important At the same time I recall that Italy is a country with a very long tradition of diplomacy of the highest level which must be taken into account The same determination and determination as you and the action of the whole Government we call for action to convince the European Union that aid is also needed for the internal economies of the Member States of the European Union We need help from our families as well as from our businesses President Draghi on the internal front the economic repercussions of this war will mainly affect the ordinary people what has remained let us say of the middle class small and medium sized enterprises artisans traders professionals micro-entrepreneurs farmers that economic fabric that has made Italy great in history and that today after two years of pandemic it is already quite martyred There are many entrepreneurs who can't stand it anymore there are many who are closing and can't keep it open This is serious damage We call on the Government and you Mr President to ask the European Union not only to intervene to protect strategic industrial areas but also this middle class which for us Italians is and has always been strategic We must not forget also the many companies that will suffer losses due to the application of sanctions against Russia Just to give examples the Lombardy Russian interchange is worth about 3 billion Confcommercio Lombardy has told us of which 1.5 billion only for the city of Milan We cannot forget that there are also 447 Italian companies operating in Russia with a turnover of about 7.4 billion which today feel abandoned to themselves You Mr Draghi who determines European choices despite perhaps your low profile wants us to believe otherwise let the partners of the European Union understand that we cannot return to the Europe of accountants and numerals We absolutely need an expansionary policy and extra spending space because we have to help our internal economies In a policy let 's say so also of control in order to try to avoid the speculative bubbles that have hit not only the fuel let us remind you for example the fact that lately the large shipping companies ten in the world of which four Europeans and one Swiss have suddenly made all cartels and have increased the transport costs of twelve times not justifying not even an increase of the fuel itself Is there a European Commission body responsible for antitrust Yes so why does n't he intervene We need immediate action otherwise with these transport costs we risk really putting much or much of our entrepreneurial fabric on our knees We therefore count on his intervention because what we must avoid after two years of pandemic and now the arrival of war is that Italy increasingly weakened in its productive system becomes the victim of predatory activity of foreign countries and capitals We cannot afford to become a sort of European discount Let 's close quickly with the theme of green transition which must be built Of course we agree it must be built yes but gradually because one cannot think of doing so with that ideological supposition of those who have aimed to put out the fossil energies coal oil and gas without having first ensured an alternative energy self sufficiency It was a short sighted European Union policy of which we are unfortunately paying the price today Similarly we pay the price on other issues such as the fact that the issue of agriculture which is now central with the emergency that you have highlighted has always been put by the European Union as opposed to the environment no it is a strategic mistake which unfortunately has contributed over the years and now to putting ourselves in the political conditions as we said before of emergency We probably would have been more prepared if there had n't been this shortsightedness For these reasons in telling you these things and giving you as we said at the beginning some suggestions we announce the League 's vote in favour of majority resolution built with the right balance,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#RufaGianfranco,"RUFA L SP PSd Az Mr President Minister I would like to thank the previous speaker for her announcement Unfortunately the real defeat is the need to vote as in any institutional room in the world on a motion with the objectives well explained by the Undersecretary Sisto Unfortunately even today there are at least 59 wars and conflicts with thousands of victims a year Let us think of the conflict in Afghanistan Myanmar Yemen Ethiopia and Syria with an impressive number of deaths displaced persons prisoners and people suffering from hunger From February 24 2022 another of those wars that is understood only after it has manifested itself realizing how much fear it makes To date in Ukraine 4,560 deaths and 5,691 wounded without calculating psychological and physical deaths consequence of satanic atrocity for possession of resources for economic cultural religious and demographic possession possession and supremacy where treaties conventions and promises fall in the face of atrocious ends and revenge The horrors of the battle of Solferino in 1859 prompted Jean Henry Dunant to set up the Red Cross From 1864 until now numerous conventions of international law have been signed up to the four Geneva Conventions the Convention for the wounded and sick in the countryside for the wounded and the sick on the sea for the treatment of prisoners for the protection of civilian people in times of war Two other protocols had to be added to these in 1977 the protection of victims of international and non-international armed conflicts In 2005 always out of necessity and always in Geneva a third additional protocol was introduced with the need to adopt a distinctive emblem following the attack on the Red Cross and the Red Crescent In this simple and quick excursus we understand how history did not teach did not make us understand how atrocious human wickedness is especially at war There is never a fair war and there is never a war with a winner because they all lose when the dead or dead living like the victims of rape remain on the ground These acts war crimes and crimes against humanity are the manifestation of animal behavior dictated by hatred and violence and contempt of the enemy We should stop and think how cruel the minutes hours and days of such squalid violence are Those who commit them will never have a justification Let us ask ourselves what will remain of the body and soul of those women of those men and of those children raped and raped and forced also to witness such atrocities With victory comes the loot has been a cry of war for centuries Men interned in concentration camps severely tortured and women especially women part of this unpleasant spoil We must then build a society that is able not to forget and not to think that the words of solidarity and compassion are enough when there is a war we must intervene to end and finish the laments of physical and psychological suffering History must be feared and respected It is like when I request that the National Day be established out of respect in memory of the victims of the war rapes of 1943 1944 better known with a name that although annoying is historical and real that is the Moroccans In the face of the rapes of more than 60,000 women men and children of an Italian people the Ciociano people my people in front of the offensive titled in France of squares and streets to goumiers soldiers framed in the corps expéditionnaire français an Italie CEF under General Juin 's command we must assert the memory and the claim of apology without concern whether or not the thought and feeling of oltralpe are impacted Mr President I would like to stress that we do not recognise this day as required by the draft Law 2281 of 2021 which means that we will also speak in this House today by denying and offending history and reality It is not a challenge or the pride of a people which is certainly not desired but the recognition of reality respect for suffering and memory an indelible memory also thanks to the exceptional interpretation of the sublime Sophia Loren in the film La Ciociara And it is in schools that the history and consequences of war must be taught The strength of peace and the cruelty of war must be understood in schools It is necessary to study history in order not to forget Today we try to explain to our children the story of the invasion in Ukraine the evils of a conquering people on a conquered one Let us make it clear how much suffering and violence on the bodies and life of a people can bring war The League will vote in favour of the motion hoping that the Commission responsible for drawing up a draft crime code will not be an instrument of only discussion and participation and hoping that the International Criminal

#GarneroSantancheDaniela,Madam President Minister I have listened carefully to what you have come to tell us in this House and I say to you that I had the impression that yours was a report a lesson almost from university explaining the cubic meters explaining various problems from where we import the gas and more Minister I believe that in this House that of the Senate of the Republic you should have brought solutions today He should have let the Italians know what will happen to their lives their businesses their families in the coming weeks Instead he did n't say anything about it at all In our opinion there are two fundamental elements the war that Putin waged in Ukraine has changed and is changing the world Therefore in his report today he should at least have mentioned the PNRR which is obsolete today and has no sense of existence as it was written and thought If I am not mistaken about 40 of the resources are on the ecological transition Do you think that at this moment where they are bombing where they are killing the theme is the ecological transition or the survival of our industries and our families When you came to the industry committee you considered my question provocative It is not provocative Minister but simply of common sense In life in fact not everything is an immovable paracarriage If there are situations which certainly none of us had considered and which we are living things change You 're the government of the best There is a President in Office of the Council who is certainly authoritative who in Europe can express his vision without it and without it and I hope that he will also be heard What are you waiting to tell us that that PNRR needs to be changed in its foundation That 's the first question I 'd like you to answer which you have n't done yet In addition Minister there is a second element In addition to this frightening war that we are experiencing our businesses have been living for two and a half years three winters a series of economic disasters and I believe you know the life of the real country Everything that has happened in fact has certainly impacted very much on our economic life Therefore it is time to understand what needs to be done For us as Brothers of Italy what needs to be done is very simple we need to immediately put our hands on excise duties and VAT not to worry more about economic coverage Given the escalation of prices the state has collected more VAT and today could have the money to calm down all those highly energetic production sectors and perhaps make them work more quietly Mr Minister what will happen when you imagine because we do not have the confidence of this not to intervene on prices or perhaps to intervene late throwing away time that time that businesses and families do not have If you do not decide today but perhaps it was good to do so yesterday to lower the price of diesel and energy the companies will close the companies will fire and the cost on the social shock absorbers will be much higher than the intervention that you should do today This is therefore a very short sighted vision Minister we are also pleased when you say that perhaps within thirty or forty months we will be able to be less dependent on Russia or other countries Families and businesses however are not thirty six forty months old families and businesses are thinking of tomorrow Did you see what 's going on in the transport sector We are one of the countries with the highest number of trucks for road transport and if they stop everything will stop because we will have the problem of going to the supermarket to do the shopping I therefore think that you should take action without delay I would have expected you to come to this House today to say that energy is a primary asset So far in fact I 've talked to her about companies and families but I could also talk to her about all those people who are disabled and fragile who are currently attached to machines to keep living Do you realize that there are Italians for whom energy is a primary asset because without that tube attached to a plug they would die Can we say then that energy is a primary asset I have n't heard a word from this government about fragile people Minister you must give us an answer because when a Minister of the Republic says that there is a gigantic scam and that there are speculators you must tell us if they are natural persons and in that case you must say name and surname or if the speculators and scammers are those who today determine the price because in that case you as Minister and member of the Government in two minutes can decide if this is the problem to reevaluate the price formation Brothers of Italy have said this for many days and yesterday a motion was also presented to the House Our proposals are simple but effective and above all would impact tomorrow on the lives of businesses and families I cannot understand why perhaps by deciding to evaluate three months in three months it is not established that VAT and excise duties will be eliminated tomorrow You know very well Minister that in that way the price would be completely different I am sorry to some extent to correct a professor but I must remind you that a few days ago you said that the average price of fuels would not exceed EUR 1.95 On Monday March 7 he took over the average price of fuel weekly and reported a finished price of 1.95 euros per litre for green petrol as we know however he exceeded the 2.30 euros amply In that case too perhaps it would be better not to make such a daring forecast which in one way could put citizens in a more tranquil position thinking that that is the maximum price because you know that it will most likely come over EUR 4 per litre In conclusion Minister today we did not expect a lesson or a report we believed that the Italians who hang from his lips could understand if their trucks can circulate if they can continue to produce tiles if paper mills can still make paper if those Italian excellences can still continue to produce because there are no solutions from university lessons,#group.FdI,Fratelli

fundamental elements war putin waged ukraine changed changing world therefore report today least mentioned pnrr obsolete today sense existence written thought mistaken 40 resources ecological transition think moment bombing killing theme ecological transition survival industries families came industry committee considered question provocative provocative minister simply common sense life

without hope also heard waiting tell us pnrr needs changed foundation 's first question 'd like answer n't done yet addition minister second element addition frightening war experiencing businesses living two half years three winters series economic disasters believe know life real country everything happened fact certainly impacted much economic life therefore time understand needs done us

sectors perhaps make work quietly mr minister happen imagine confidence intervene prices perhaps intervene late throwing away time time businesses families decide today perhaps good yesterday lower

#VescoviManuel,Mr President ladies and gentlemen allow me first of all to address an important issue It is right to speak in times of foreign policy crisis and we are doing so today for very dangerous action However it would be nice if this House were more often involved in talking about foreign policy The last time this happened with regard to the Afghan situation and today we are talking about Ukraine I think that the size of a country is measured by foreign policy Perhaps in this House we could talk more about finding solutions and ideas to suggest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and President Draghi because it is through these choices that the greatness of our country is determined I was very pleased when President Draghi was very determined determined and pragmatic in defending President Ursula von der Leyen with regard to the Turkish question with a test of international diplomacy and decision of our country In these moments we feel proud to belong to a country that wants to be respected also abroad We come to the current situation the economy has just started again starting again after two difficult years But there is also great competition on raw materials a very important arms race tension in the East China Sea and the crisis in Ukraine We need to be clear about what is going on and then we need to give answers I have heard many judgments from my fellow Members today I believe however that sometimes ruling and expressing judgments also block diplomacy You Minister said that diplomacy even ours is doing a great job I am very happy and thank all our diplomats and staff who are working to find a solution As you said we must use diplomacy a lot and be pragmatic in order to avoid a conflict which I hope not could be at home I think in short as a first point that none of us are in favour of war Today unanimously we are all opposed to any act of war all of us in this House but also in the real world of our country The second point is that the vast majority of this House as well as my own personal view and my Group believe that since it is in the Atlantic Pact it must be respected Thirdly however we must listen to and understand the will of the peoples who must be respected as the UN stated in 1966 with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which was adopted in our country in 1976 I was taking into account the actors in the current situation and their different and opposing interests We have Italian interests those of America Russia Europe the countries of the Atlantic Pact Ukraine and then also the interests of the people of Crimea and Donbass There are various actors and when one makes diplomacy express as I heard today certain sentences do not help It is necessary to find the synthesis of the various interests the meeting point We must put ourselves in the shoes of those actors in order to find the synthesis and avoid something absolutely disastrous that could be war but it could also be equally disastrous the economic sanctions on which the country will naturally decide I do n't mean we 're against it and it 's war data However we must also consider the repercussions of these sanctions It is easy for those who sign them to set sanctions but then they have repercussions in the real country they have repercussions in the people of companies perhaps employees of entrepreneurs companies that close precisely because they suffer their consequences The country will decide but we are careful to establish sanctions reasoning also in the interest of our country Minister in conclusion for our part great space and great work to diplomacy in order to be able to listen to all the actors I have listed before certainly I have forgotten some of them limiting myself to the most important ones in order to find a solution that is good for all the countries concerned,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,12.695143,5.1840143,30,mr president ladies gentlemen allow first address

#VescoviManuel,Mr President I think we are all for peace and none of us are for war We are working precisely to achieve peace as soon as possible also thanks to our diplomacy Coming to the point of the Ukraine decree Mr President I have always asked myself a question The issue in that area has been known since 2014 since then we have certainly not made a policy of diversification so much so that today 40 of the gas the European Union imports it from Russia financing it We must therefore be careful on the one hand to put sanctions rightly but on the other hand we remember that the European Union today buys 40 of gas from Russia Maybe all these not from the last ten years no to the TAP no to the TAV no to everything have led us to this situation of dependence on Russia Our country needs a vision also as a policy of gas and energy We must have a propensity for the future be able to talk to yeses and give a vision of the next ten years Otherwise we will find ourselves as today always with a decree Ukraine and always living in urgency With urgency however we do not build a great country The second point which I raised also through a question is that Italy is lucky even at a geographical level to be at the centre of the Mediterranean We must therefore begin to have this vision and also relations with North Africa with countries from which to import gas in order not to be a hostage of a single nation We must also be able to find solutions within our country and to have relations with the Balkan countries I put a question about fifteen days ago about the electricity pipeline that connects Italy with Montenegro where there is already a structure and a cable that imports electricity It would take a second to double the electricity to import into our country To start having these vision and visional relationships which also lead us to connections with all the Balkan countries in this specific case with Montenegro for us could be one of the solutions a little on one side and a little on the other it is better to diversify and not have a single important supplier Mr President allow me then to take a political step The size of a country is measured by its foreign policy We are all seeing in the newspapers that a passage is taking place in Turkey to find a diplomatic route between Ukraine and Russia I would have liked this passage to have taken place in our country since we have a very important class of ambassadors to whom I commend because together with all our staff abroad they are truly extraordinary people However this is not the case I would like to ask the Foreign Minister a question in the sense of a reflection are the terms he is using which I have heard in some television broadcasts adequate to achieve an important diplomatic route between Ukraine and Russia We are trying to become the diplomatic reference point in order to find a solution between the two states,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,13.197341,3.1529481,30,mr president think peace none us war working precisely achieve peace soon possible also thanks diplomacy coming point ukraine decree mr president always asked question issue area known since 2014 since certainly made policy diversification much today 40 gas european union imports russia financing must therefore careful one hand put sanctions rightly hand remember european union today buys 40 gas russia maybe last ten years tap tav everything led us situation dependence russia country needs vision also policy gas energy must propensity future able talk yeses give vision next ten years otherwise find today always decree ukraine always living urgency urgency however build great country second point raised also question italy lucky even geographical level centre mediterranean must therefore begin vision also relations north africa countries import gas order hostage single nation must also able find solutions within country relations balkan countries put question fifteen days ago electricity pipeline connects italy montenegro already structure cable imports electricity would take second double electricity import country start vision visional relationships also lead us connections balkan countries specific case montenegro us could one solutions little one side little better diversify single important supplier mr president allow take political step size country measured foreign policy seeing newspapers passage taking place turkey find diplomatic route ukraine russia would liked passage taken place country since important class ambassadors commend together staff abroad truly extraordinary people however case would like ask foreign minister question sense reflection terms using heard television broadcasts adequate achieve important diplomatic route ukraine russia trying become diplomatic reference point order find solution two states
#PellegriniEmanuele,Mr President I rise to explain the G101 agenda I believe that this swindle of the day comes from an act of political responsibility In the face of the decision of the French appeal court which concerns the refusal to extradite a whole series of people who have committed very serious crimes it is the political responsibility of this Parliament and the Government to take a position obviously within the powers entrusted to them With this agenda we ask the Government to commit itself to doing everything diplomatically useful and necessary so that the action of the Government also of the French Government because we know that however the proxy has a political derivation can lead to a decision to accept the request for extradition Extradition that is not only sacrosanct from the legal point of view but I believe weighing the words I say ethically duty free by all those institutions that must assist the relatives of the victims and all those who have suffered suffering because of the very serious acts of crime that we cannot forget just because it has been so many years This is a form of respect we owe to the victims and relatives of the victims To say that a defendant a convicted person because he is such is in difficult health conditions does not mean that he cannot suffer the right judgment and the right penalty Let 's remember that those who carry out the profession of lawyer are taught that every lawyer must assist his client in order to be defended in the best possible way but also in order to receive the right penalty On the one hand therefore we have a moment of political responsibility which takes shape in this agenda which aims to respect the legality decisions and convictions that these subjects have already suffered in our country in respect of the deaths suffering and blood shed in those terrible years This is also an act of international political maturity We cannot talk about the European Union in fact of European integration if we do not respect the principles contained in this Treaty of international cooperation also with regard to the surrender of the people who have committed these very serious crimes We cannot therefore think that this agenda will be allowed to go this way simply as a letter on paper This is a political act that must be weighed internationally Therefore we ask the Government to promote these actions of course from a diplomatic point of view because we know very well that French judicial action is an autonomous action By assuming the responsibility for what I say I repeat that we cannot think that within a sentence of a judicial body even if of a country absolutely civil as France can be the refusal to extradition can be justified simply because the terms the numbers of articles of the laws that are intended to apply are not indicated This is because we know very well that judges must judge according to law and that it is the task of judges to know the law and therefore to apply it That is what we are asking for on the agenda We simply call for compliance with international rules standards and relations but above all what is more important respect for people killed by people I cannot even define people because they are only criminals,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,18.855389,1.4635081,30,mr president rise explain g101

#BossiSimone,Mr President Mr Draghi I have listened carefully to your words The European Council of 24 and 25 March will address the Russian Ukrainian crisis as one of the topics on the agenda Everyone in this House is well aware that in this sad affair there is an attacking country and an assaulted country However I think it is good to remember that the conflict in Ukraine certainly has historical and profound roots The crisis initially political and later military began with the demonstrations in Kiev in November 2013 a crisis that has brought to light in a striking way one of the many international fault lines that have developed most in the countries belonging to the former Soviet Union The Ukrainian example before our eyes today is perhaps the most symbolically significant and geographically most impactful for the interests of European scenarios in all its drama However the warnings of this crisis had already emerged over the last twenty years throughout the Soviet bloc Therefore in the eye of a careful observer it is important to keep in mind that the Ukrainian scenario risks not being an isolated phenomenon nor even being the last We all know in this House and not only in this House but of course we do not that this crisis could for example spread rapidly into the Asian scenario President Draghi I am sincere and tell you that this seemingly quiet climate does not reassure me but I believe that it is the same for you and your Government Given that the Senate Assembly unanimously wants a ceasefire between the parties I believe that it is right to point out that among the main commitments of the majority resolution assessed and written carefully in the Commissions moreover before the intervention of Ukrainian President Zelensky yesterday there is precisely an indication to the Government to continue in this objective However it should be understood how the European Union can play a diplomatic role and whether the European Union can have the opportunity to play this role With all honesty the Union has not been able to interpret this role of mediation at the moment We have seen a number of unitary attempts by the French President who have not had the outcome hoped for But if Europe really can and wants to play this role it would be extremely useful to understand what the so called red lines for Brussels are at last I believe that an important table such as the European Council to which you will be present is useful in trying to make this summary If as it seems Ukraine 's neutrality with regard to NATO membership is an essential part of Russia and Kiev has also opened up to this condition we must think of a security system capable of defending Ukraine in the short to medium term In this game the European Union must show its will firmly not least in order to be able to effectively speed up the potential negotiation process and stop this useless massacre of lives of civilians that we would never have expected to see in 2022 least after a world pandemic But tomorrow 's European Council will also have the issue of the strategic compass the instrument that contains the European Union 's security and defence programmes Reading the first published document the plan seems extremely ambitious and I do not know whether this is good or bad What jumps at first sight is that it has been clearly accelerated by the new front opened by the Russian invasion in Ukraine and I do not think it is just my impression If you will allow me Mr President in Office of the Council on the issue of the strategic compass and the autonomy of European defence I have a couple of comments that I would like to leave to you and to the House The first point is that although in every document both national and European we hurry to say the opposite the risk of a future overlap between European defence and NATO is already more than clear Let us remember that it is from a European embryo the 1948 Brussels Treaty that the future Atlantic Pact of 1949 then the Atlantic Alliance also arises from the European will to involve the United States in the collective defence of the continent Therefore there is talk of European defence made up of thousands of men and countries in cooperation and not in conflict with NATO It is precisely the robustness of this statement that is not so clear at all as structural anticipations are not clear The second point again on the strategic compass is that we risk making the same mistake again with the birth of the European Union that of starting from the roof and not from the foundations A common defence presupposes a common strategic thought and this at the moment simply does not exist An example of what I am saying is that we saw it at the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis the European Court of Justice rejecting the appeal made by Hungary and Poland has in fact established that Brussels can retain the funding of Member States that violate the rule of law a decision that allows the Commission therefore to potentially suspend payments to Warsaw and Budapest Let us stop and reason on the strategic scope of this European modus operandi a decision that takes place in the midst of the escalation between Russia and Ukraine just when Europe should show itself as a united front and I remind all of you that Poland and Hungary are part of that line from the Baltic to the Black Sea and that it should eventually absorb a potential Russian conventional attack on Europe If the intention of the European Commission at this historic moment is therefore to sanction countries such as Poland and Hungary to which much of the European defence has been entrusted it is objectively difficult to speak of strategic autonomy given the illogical nature of this behaviour Finally with regard to the economic response to the crisis the data are beginning to stabilize and we are confident that this international tension will have a strong impact on our economy Some financial institutions report 1.5 percentage points less than the estimates in the Eurozone and this translates into two percentage points for Italy estimates that are confirmed by the indiscretions we read every day on the national press bodies I say therefore President Draghi let us not be in the same situation as the pandemic originally experienced when we felt that we would face the crisis with a few billion detours Let us get out of a very serious two year economic recession let us be ready to protect our economic system We try to understand how our country can find some opportunities in the medium term especially in the policies of diversification of energy supply The opportunity is provided by the possibility of moving the European political and energy centre of gravity southwards after we have witnessed with the two Nord Stream projects the concentration on the East West energy axis Italy can return to aspire to represent the energy hub of the South North axis by developing relations with the wider Mediterranean front The Foreign Minister 's missions to Algiers as well as the attempts to cooperate with the Mediterranean countries Spain Portugal and Greece which we have witnessed in recent days are good In conclusion I understand that the Government has decided how the Country Italy and Italians must take sides assuming great responsibilities and possibly great repercussions Well Mr Draghi if this is the path the Government intends to take towards peace do so by involving Parliament more closely in every decision because the continuing development of the situation must see us united with a clear mandate to ensure that this responsibility taken at international level must provide first and foremost for the protection of our citizens our businesses and future generations The burden of today 's choices must not and must not fall on those who have already suffered on a people who have been leaving for two very hard years in economic social and health terms Let us take on without hesitation the responsibility to act to protect the families businesses and the spending capacity of our population,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#FuscoUmberto,Mr President ladies and gentlemen Member of the Government the crisis in Ukraine has focused on a subject that of military spending which has actually been the subject of a wide ranging debate and analysis both political and academic over the past few years In the various contexts of deepening in the Commission the need to finance more and at the same time rationalise our military spending has been highlighted on several occasions The great tension caused at this time by a war scenario at the borders of the European Union must not confuse us and distract us from a reform of our security system that is at least necessary It is recalled that the willingness to commit the Atlantic Alliance member countries to reach 2 of GDP for defence expenditure dates back to the NATO summit in Wales in September 2014 In the conclusions of the summit this commitment is found in point 14 In recent years our country has demonstrated its will to respect this promise reversing the trend of lowering military spending that has continued inexorable since the post war period Therefore net of today 's debate it is plausible to think that our country has already planned a path that will lead to the fulfilment of commitments made at international level However I would stress that it is important not to superimpose the conflict situation at our borders with the increase in defence spending That would be a big mistake Talking about rearming is improper confusing public opinion and does not do justice to the immense work that our armed forces do for our country Investing in the defence sector means also and above all investing in research and work It is precisely in the conclusions of the NATO summit mentioned earlier that this concept is expressed Point 14 calls for allies to spend at least 20 of their military expenditure on research and development because our security and defence depend both on how much we spend and how we spend That is why it is certainly important to have a unanimous will reiterated in Parliament But even more fundamental is to have a clear vision of where to go and how to improve our military spending Well the quantitative commitment but that it is accompanied by a commitment of modernization and efficiency A small remark which can be useful for a future debate on the subject to improve defence spending we must aim to have an increasingly structural vision of interforces which goes beyond the current approach of armed force divided into closed and separate sectors With regard to weapon systems aircraft and boats we have great Italian industrial excellences that must be protected and pushed for greater cooperation with other major European and world players The institutions must accompany and support this process Finally invest invest and I repeat still invest in the training processes of our staff which must be trained on the use of complex and constantly updated systems Let us remember that the role of personnel and therefore of human value within the Armed Forces is also greater than the technological capacity of armaments Training and constant updates therefore also wages that are competitive and non mortifying functions reminding us that our Armed Forces must play a different role than that of the Police Forces Allow me Mr President to thank the great work of our women and our men who every day take care of the security of our country They have been fundamental in these two years of pandemics and continue to work daily in the shadows for Italy Military spending means not only war but also justice for these people In conclusion on the Ukrainian question I would like to say a big thank you to our fellow citizens In these weeks I have personally witnessed a real race for solidarity thanks also to the help of the municipalities to help the Ukrainian population both in terms of sending humanitarian aid and in terms of receiving A beautiful example of solidarity and closeness not taken for granted in a period certainly not simple from the economic point of view It is on this and diplomatic efforts in favour of a peaceful resolution that we must work on reaffirming all our opposition to any kind of
