#JuanLuisSteegmannOlmedillas,With all due respect Madam President Very good afternoon ladies and gentlemen To the motion presented today Citizens by his lordship Don Guillermo Díaz passes as to the urgent inquiry he presented it is a little decorated The interpellation was a feignment a kind of penguinella duo in the same way that this motion becomes foam based on conditionals that you have hidden Mr. Díaz Madam President ladies and gentlemen it is the foam of the rivers to ask to eliminate the obligatory masks inside conditioning to the epidemiological situation and the comparative perspective That is what the Government already does which does everything with a gender perspective sustainable resilient incomprehensible and above all cursi It is a futility it is utopian and it is childish to ask the interterritorial council to make a calendar of descalation Our amendment is simple It urges the Government to withdraw the compulsory use of masks in all areas and at any age please release our children except within health and social health facilities and this only until it is essential I 'm pointing out some things we 've learned from the coronavirus The first which is unpredictable so the second point of the petitum is unacceptable by coercion and absurd by irresistible It is impossible to advance a calendar of descalation exposures when we do not know how long the epidemic is going to last whether it is going to turn into an endemic or if omicron is going to be the penultimate or the penultimate variant The second is about masks and he cited the one that is possibly the best university center of epidemiology in the United States the Minnesota CIDRAP First it says that the fabric masks have almost no utility with the omicron variant and second that there is no solid evidence of the utility of the mask against any variant in any environment except for the FFP2 and FFP3 masks in health and social health environments Do not misrepresent the recommendations of ECDC or WHO they are recommendations not obligations In the last update of the ECDC of 7 February at no time do they advocate that they be mandatory moreover as an alternative they put them only for vulnerable people and for vulnerable centers See if it is useless to force to wear the mask that has recently been published this COVID notebook made by twenty five Spanish scientists all very politically correct that is on this side and of twenty five chapters none is intended for masks none Ladies and gentlemen at the moment public health recommendation messages should emphasize the extent to which they have a higher hierarchy of effectiveness vaccination otherwise not All restrictive measures imposed by the Government since the proclamation of the declared state of alarm contrary to the Constitution through VOX must therefore be dropped I 'm on my way We therefore reject the impositions that are imposed on the population when our fellow citizens need recommendations that adapt to the changing reality of the epidemic We refuse to have the children gagged We are disgusted by what a socialist MEP has revealed today in the Committee on Health that one reason for maintaining the mandatory masks is because they have eliminated isolation for the infected What a shame What a shame We are disgusted that the obligatory masks force the Spaniards to choose between masks and heating It disgusts us and we say that 's enough What we need in Spain at the present time is continuous true and verifiable information about the epidemic to provide citizens with sufficient knowledge to take informed measures to protect their health that of their own people and their economy I am sorry to repeat what I said in the Health Committee a few hours ago I 'm sorry because you can give the impression that we believe that on the sides of the sinister and separatists do not understand either our sources Mrs Andres or our arguments I 'm so sorry Nothing closer to reality they do n't understand them I 'm done Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,12.177468,-24.4469,1,due respect madam president good afternoon ladies gentlemen motion presented

#JuanLuisSteegmannOlmedillas,With all due respect Madam President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon Citizens propose the cessation of compulsory masks in public transport and in some health facilities such as pharmacies and optics Six months ago they tabled a similar more fearful motion and VOX tabled an amendment to remove the mandatory masks for all persons of any age in all areas except within health centres I say this because in the exhibition of this proposition it is said that Citizens stayed alone in this abolitionist petition let 's say so and the only explanation that I think of is that they have problems of memory or identity because as it is now the liberals it can be because of that Despite this we will support this non-law proposal but first I want to highlight several facts First of all here we have been suddenly proposed by the Lordship of Podemos a government of experts but I will point out a number of facts The predominant variant BA.5 is the most contagious COVID 19 has changed and now it can be said that mortality is similar to that of influenza The government 's obligation is for all types of masks but it turns out that fabric masks serve nothing that surgery does not serve just the BA5 variant and that the utility of masks at the population level has only been demonstrated for FFP2 masks and in health environments Point There are no publications that have demonstrated the usefulness of masks in public transport I repeat there are no publications Vulnerable people could benefit from the use of FFP2 masks but if the Government wanted to prescribe FFP2 masks to protect them they should only be for vulnerable people who would have to pay the equivalent of half a litre of milk 600 millilitres of juice and three eggs If the masks remain compulsory as Don Simón claims when the Spanish know that the expert who says that the masks have to be compulsory is Don Fernando Simón they will immediately be removed and if the masks have to be financed it would have to be as proposed by VOX financed by the State and not by the Spanish pocket But the government prefers to seize VAT to fill the pockets of the chiringuitos who want to corrupt our children and our grandchildren both with sex and drugs From this rostrum we demand that the public health committee make public the deliberations and the evidence supporting all its decisions and also because it has to apply article 11 of Law 33/2011 the Spaniards have the right to know it We also call on scientific societies to be courageous and honest to make their recommendations public to see their foundations and to communicate them to all Spaniards so that they have real verifiable and real time information Ladies and gentlemen we need selective shields not global impositions The VOX Parliamentary Group has proposed all the measures which have been many and you know it to combat the epidemic from scientific evidence and under the premise of non-compulsoryness In VOX we believe that the Spaniards have the common sense enough to understand all kinds of reasoned recommendations and therefore we reject the obligatory masks because they are useless to the vast majority and because in these moments of hardship people will have to choose between masks heating or food We announce that we will reject any totalitarian and frightening imposition in the conviction that this Government has taken advantage of it exploited it and if we leave it used it for illegitimate and illegal purposes Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,13.061402,-24.991568,1,due respect madam president ladies gentlemen good afternoon citizens propose cessation compulsory masks public transport health

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much Mr President This proposal for an organic law brought to us by the Socialist Group is a clear threat to the independence of justice the rule of law and legality That is why I would like my first words to pay tribute to a man Pedro Alfonso Casado lieutenant colonel of the Civil Guard of the Special Intervention Unit who died on 5 July in an act of service precisely defending legality the rule of law and justice Honor and glory to the Civil Guard and its heroes Now let 's go to what I do n't know if I qualify as a sanatorium a voodoo or a pantomime between the Socialist Party and the People 's Party so much riding riding so much they 're always the same doing the same If we go back to March last year we realize that the Socialist Group with its partner Podemos presented a proposal for an organic law to approve article 570 bis of the Organic Law of the Judiciary In his explanatory statement he told us I read literally From the above the need to limit the decisions taken by a outgoing General Council of the Judiciary i.e. in office to exclude from its powers the possibility of electing inter alia the judges of the Constitutional Court This is a year and a few months ago Well now in July 2022 the Socialist Group we have fallen from the proposal presents us with the reform of the reform Now that article 570 bis is no longer valid for them it no longer serves them and they seek for the single direct reading procedure and therefore trying as far as possible to ignore this very serious attack on justice and the independence of the judiciary that we adopt a proposal in which it now says otherwise To avoid this situation which they created in the March reform last year which can cause difficulties in the renewal of constitutional bodies it is proposed to reform this article so that the General Council of the Judiciary can now appoint at least the two judges of the Constitutional Court which is what they claim corresponding by election of the General Council of the Judiciary This has been reported by the courts I will refer to the complaint made to the Group of States against the Corruption of the Council of Europe GRECO by the Civic Platform for Judicial Independence They have clearly stated that it is solely in the interest of the Government to control the Constitutional Court They have said in their complaint that it is a formal violation because it avoids any process of hearing when presenting it as a proposal for an organic law and not as a draft law Moreover it falls into the background of an issue that clearly violates article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights because it violates or violates the principles of guarantee independence and impartiality of judicial bodies We could continue to make all kinds of legal assessments but I believe that the Spaniards need to speak to them in clear high and precise Spanish in this seat of national sovereignty to put aside the entire media circus and the politicians language to which the Socialist Party and the People 's Party so accustomed and to tell them and explain at least for that reason VOX has come what is behind many of these parliamentary initiatives I would like to underline the special gravity of this and I will do so in a graphic way with this drawing in which all Spaniards will be able to see the Congress of Deputies and all its lords above reforming the Organic Law of the Judiciary Well what do you want with it To appoint toe yes toe magistrates who are like them And place them where At the General Council of the Judiciary and hence directly at the Constitutional Court For what To continue to control the Constitutional Court politically And what do you want with that They claim that there will be no further rulings declaring the unconstitutionality of two states of alarm or for example the unconstitutionality of including Pablo Iglesias in the CNI 's supervisory commission or that the remedy for the kidnapping of this same House will be allowed or that resources such as those that our group has submitted against labour reform or against euthanasia so many resources that the Socialist Party fears may go wrong in a constitutional court that has not properly tied up That is the reality that is the sad reality before which we find ourselves a Socialist Party and a People 's Party that do not claim in any way even if they are filled with mouths saying otherwise that there is an independent justice We will speak tomorrow about VOX 's proposal that the General Council of the Judiciary be truly an independent body that the twelve judges under the Judiciary be elected by and from judges and magistrates that politicians through Congress and the Senate not be able to continue to put to their finger in the Supreme Court in the provincial hearings in the National High Court and in the Constitutional Court that they denounce before all of you and the Spanish the constant maneuvers they have made because they do not believe in the division of powers because they do not believe in the rule of law and because they believe much less in judges and magistrates who act exclusively to the dictate of the law and to the service of legality the rule of law and the Constitution The Socialist Party and the People 's Party or the People 's Party and the Socialist Party want puppets that they can handle but that sooner than later with VOX in government is going to end Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,7.0906096,-19.342758,1,thank much mr president proposal organic law brought us socialist group clear threat independence justice rule law legality would like first words pay tribute man pedro alfonso casado lieutenant colonel civil guard

#MercedesJaraMoreno,Mr. President ladies and gentlemen good morning We are here today to discuss the amendment to the whole of the Citizens Parliamentary Group 's bill on urgent prevention and containment measures to address the health crisis caused by COVID 19 As we discussed on 1 February blackmail seemed to us to be the real decree law and its validation and blackmail in substance and in form seems to us today to be the debate of this amendment to the whole presented by the Citizens Group To talk about health restrictions and masks do they force us to treat pensions again If they had proposed deleting this point which should be incorporated by its importance in another initiative and not in the health framework of preventive measures against COVID we could start talking We say no to blackmail but we do not say no to pensioners on the contrary we must again oppose their debate now since it is absolutely inappropriate and a practice too common and repeated in this Government to mix matters that have nothing to do with each other to force us to vote for the whole thing on the side I repeat it again as a few weeks ago Ortega Lara 's party does not allow blackmail With regard to the amendment of Law 2/2021 the removal of the restrictions imposed by the Government was shared but it was constitutionally unacceptable for Citizens to transfer to the Congress of Deputies the competence of the declaration of the end of the crisis generated by COVID 19 It is the responsibility of the Government which already abdicated transferring its responsibility to the autonomous communities I take this opportunity to give our opinion on how we should reintegrate into normality The Government should at this time only issue recommendations and not impose any more obligations or of course additional restrictions since the scientific evidence the flow of this last wave and the management of the countries in our environment have already highlighted that they serve no purpose I repeat they can recommend it but they must not force it The restrictive measures imposed have led to the destruction of a multitude of people and small businesses who have also been unable to access the aid announced by the Executive in the form of drums and plates because in daily practice the bureaucracy has prevented them from accessing them The ineffectiveness of prohibitions and the high level of injury to citizens in general and to workers in particular have already been demonstrated To the catastrophe of the Chinese plague is added the Russian war and the inefficiency of the 'sanchocommunist government which is a constant If we analyze this last wave in which we are still sailing we can see that although the severity has decreased with vaccination the number of infected has been so high that although the percentage of serious patients over the total number has decreased in absolute numbers the special services of the hospitals have again collapsed Let 's not be fooled we 're still in trouble Obligatory masks inside outside and interpersonal distance do not seem to have the effectiveness that should be with regard to the containment of the disease For this reason many countries in our environment are beginning to dispense with them for either we die of COVID or we die of hunger aided by the measures imposed by this Government Given that the pandemic situation has no near end and that we already have experience of what the measures taken so far have given us it may be time to change course and choose to equip citizens with knowledge so that everyone can protect their health and economy by making their decisions freely In short in VOX we advocate for the truthful information to the Spaniards without any limitation We must be treated as responsible adults We need to educate ourselves in healthy lifestyles and we need to be trained to avoid infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID flu tuberculosis pneumonia and those that come Thirdly and with regard to retired healthcare professionals we reiterate here our concern that the increase in their income has a negative impact on their taxation They must consider that their extra wage is taxed at the minimum rate in order to make up for them and not to be taxed with which the Government would be benefiting in addition to its work from its income Ultimately and with regard to the recruitment of foreign health care workers it should be noted that the completion of this sixth wave makes it less urgent to rush into the recruitment of professionals and what we should do is to speed up the approval process especially in the case of Ukrainian health care workers These professionals must have the same responsibilities as regular workers without requiring supervision by their peers If this were not the case comparative grievances could arise in terms of remuneration and functions and all this could lead to job tensions for the optional staff Think if doctors no longer have time to properly care for patients there is even less time for the care or supervision of the work of other colleagues and the same happens in other professional categories In short while we share the vision of removing the restrictions and prohibitions imposed by the Government which can and must now establish properly informed recommendations we will vote against this amendment because the Citizens Parliamentary Group has not had the courage to propose the withdrawal of pensions in its quest for survival approaching the dynamics of the Government Thank you very much Mr Vice President Thank you For the People 's Parliamentary Group in Congress I have the floor Mrs Pastor,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,11.647425,-24.61991,1,mr. president ladies gentlemen good morning today

#MercedesJaraMoreno,Madam Minister Madam President ladies and gentlemen we are again here to talk about rules and prohibitions that have failed to contain the pandemic such as Royal Decree Law 30/2021 of 23 December which among other things regulates the use of masks We say it loudly there is no scientific study I repeat there is no study that has demonstrated the usefulness of outdoor masks Of course they are useful in indoor spaces and an FFP2 mask is better than a surgical one and is in turn better than a fabric one but none of them are worth anything if it is misused or used longer than due it is more they can become a walking focal point of contagion That 's the real problem But it is a problem that you have preferred to hide because it would mean treating the Spanish as adults which this government never wants to do They prefer to subject the Spaniards to absurd regulations and then rejoice at how they obey them which gives them a sense of domination over the population Better to impose than to report on reality But as a doctor I assure you that the Spaniards have good health criteria have common sense and are getting tired of their absurd and unjustified impositions The Spanish Government and the Taifa governments never inform the Spanish if they did they would have to recognize VOX 's proposal for the masks to be financed That 's the real problem We have a clear example in schools where this tyranny is exercised more rigorously The chances of hospitalization and ICU in children are extremely low and the minimal lethality so it makes no sense to use masks in recreation and in a context of high vaccination of the parents neither in the interior Adequate ventilation diagnostic tests and masks suitable for teachers That 's the way to go in schools When a parent knows that a reused mask is an infection vehicle we will be fighting the epidemic When the state funds the masks we 'll be fighting the pandemic When filter ventilation mechanisms are put in place in public transport we will be fighting the pandemic When a family does n't spend 10 of their income buying masks and antigen testing we 'll be fighting the epidemic This government does not fight the epidemic all you do is dictate a useless measure to cover up your incompetence Not to finance masks or to cancel the VAT on FFP2 masks is a credible proof that the government puts the collection before the citizen 's health You only think of collecting to then waste that money that you steal from the Spaniards in wages for the useless plugs that the NGOs and the ministries parasitize Stop bittering the lives of citizens make recommendations report well and have citizens decide freely We 're sick of such baseless imposition That 's it With regard to article 2 with regard to the recruitment of retired health personnel we believe that the work should be adapted to its risk profile at reduced hours not at night and also with an adequate tax contribution and remuneration to compensate them for their sacrifice In relation to article 3 do you believe that hiring extra-Community doctors will solve the saturation of primary and specialized care We 're telling you it 's not going to be like this It would be smarter to perform concerts with private health and only go to non-Community specialists if necessary and always taking into account the opinion of professional colleges Finally the Government has introduced into this royal decree law a matter that has nothing to do with the essence of the decree it is an ugly practice that you abuse where you hang a matter as transcendental as that of pensions which deserves a separate treatment It is good enough to use pensioners and our elders as currency Stop blackmailing this Congress to cover up its inability to give a dignified solution to the weakest people It is always the same ladies and gentlemen they throw the bone of the debate at those Tertullians on the left who come out like dogs of prey to bite and attack the opposition parties telling half truths or lying without any kind of modesty to widows elders or parents of disabled people By the way this group opposes the comparative aggravation between pensioners who have contributed and those who have not when they have very similar pay We do n't care Ortega Lara 's game does n't pay for blackmail Madam President ladies and gentlemen we will oppose the validation of this royal decree- law not only because of the obligation to wear masks or because of its harmful management of human resources in public health but also because we consider it a genuine aberration and a cowardice on your part Mr Sánchez to put in the same package the masks and the management of human resources health along with a subject as serious as pensions We cannot allow pensioners to continue to be used as a currency of exchange because it is cruel and inhuman and clearly portrays the ill intentions of this Government totalitarianism and imposition In VOX we will always defend the Spaniards especially the weakest and that is why we will not allow this blackmail Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,12.7797365,-25.872925,1,madam minister

#TosatoPaolo,TOSATO L SP PSd Az Mr President the measure under consideration by the Government that it calls for confidence certainly contains measures that are acceptable and therefore it will have the vote of confidence of the League The work in the Commission to improve the measure certainly took place with the commitment of all all the political forces and the Government Everyone basically did their part Overall the judgment can only be positive Are the measurements right That is the question we have to ask ourselves when we vote on a measure The answer is that yes they are useful because they support many groups affected by the pandemic and the economic crisis However there is another question that we have to ask ourselves and that we have a duty to ask ourselves are these measures sufficient Unfortunately the answer is that they are not The next decree law supports will also contribute but the moment we are living requires more effective responses from the Government The energy and fuel increases the difficulty of finding raw materials for industry to which we are adding or could add difficulties in supplying cereals feed and fertilizers require extraordinary action The government 's response seems slow In the Budget Committee we have all felt a strange feeling that we are examining a fair useful measure but absolutely out of the reality that the country is living today We are deeply concerned because steel mills paper mills and other production activities of the big industry are suspending production it has never happened in the history of our country It is a very serious damage to the entire manufacturing chain The costs in agriculture are now out of control I think for example to agricultural gas oil in the road haulage for the increase of fuels one risks the blockade of the country The supply of industry and large scale distribution is at risk of being put at risk by a blockade which must be avoided We all know that inflation is increasing considerably and the purchasing power of households is in danger of being irreparablely compromised These are the damages and these are the risks The government must therefore act now immediately more quickly every day of waiting is a lost day and must do so with important and decisive measures The next decree energy law what we expect to be launched this weekend cannot be expected timid or partial it must be courageous and decisive On the increase of fuels the League was the first political force to call for action on excise duties VAT and extra-trajectives but we want an effective measure a reduction of 15 cents is not an adequate response Interventions must be effective Citizens those who work and create jobs are no longer content with symbolic interventions are no longer content with our good will nor are they satisfied with our greatest commitment They want they want concrete results The crisis in industry the economic sectors and the agricultural sector is following and will unfortunately follow the social crisis of families and not only of the groups closest to the poverty line but also of the middle class Who today can afford to live dignifiedly with increases in gas electricity and fuel which sections of the population Perhaps for the first time only medium high incomes a minority of our population can do so The installment of bills and taxes is not enough it is not necessary it postpones the problems and does not solve them it makes the ascent to get out even more impervious We demand more from this government be it clear We 're in a dramatic emerging phase As the President in Office of the Council Draghi said we are moving from a market economy to a war economy so all the old rules budget balance constraints restrictions limitations are no longer current The government with President Draghi must obtain significant derogations at European level and far more important than what we are proposing to the country The League wants to help avoid a scenario that really risks being dramatic He wants to do so by supporting this Government and will certainly do so by voting on the measure under consideration Look however that the abyss is near it is near it is imminent This can be a decisive week We have high expectations from the energy decree but we also have high expectations from the decree that will change the rules regarding the containment of the pandemic and the rules that we have set to limit the severity of the situation We say and ask for enough of the rules that have led to the green pass the super green pass and the impossibility for workers over 50 to go to their jobs This is also an answer the country expects We have taken action in emergency situations The emergency today is less we must take note of it and give new freedom to the country and to the citizens who claim these results We will support the government but ultimately we ask for more speed more awareness more courage and more

#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President this amendment by Brothers of Italy calls for an extension of the period of maternity leave after childbirth to one hundred and eighty days It would be a concrete and precise act to meet the needs of mothers and whole families Evidently a child between three and six months of age needs a lot of care certainly cannot be left alone and having someone to take care of him involves costs I therefore believe this to be a perfectly reasonable proposal I would also point out that even now the state of emergency for Covid 19 then we have other states of emergency mothers who belong to categories of workers subject to the vaccination obligation there are several are deprived of the maternity allowance although they are on compulsory maternity leave if they have not complied with the terms of vaccination second and third dose This is a completely unjustified issue because the sense of these vaccination obligations is to avoid infection at the workplace since it is believed that these categories have a particular danger of contagion But a mother who is at home on maternity leave what danger does she pose to her colleagues Now the fact of depriving a mother of her livelihood and there are even single mothers I do n't think that there is a need to remember it but one forgets it when voting certain laws without any justification from the point of view of contagions I really find it unacceptable I have never been able to talk about this in this House because there has always been confidence in those measures but this is an opportunity to talk about it We cannot pretend to help families when aberrant standards are adopted against mothers who have children,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,13.605827,-22.756462,1,mr malan fdi mr president amendment brothers italy calls extension period maternity leave childbirth one hundred eighty days would concrete precise act meet needs mothers whole families evidently child three six months age needs lot care certainly cannot left alone someone take care involves costs therefore believe perfectly reasonable proposal would also point even state emergency covid 19 states emergency mothers belong categories workers subject vaccination obligation several deprived maternity allowance although compulsory maternity leave complied terms vaccination second third dose completely unjustified issue sense vaccination obligations avoid infection workplace since believed categories particular danger contagion mother home maternity leave danger pose colleagues fact depriving mother livelihood even single mothers n't think need remember one forgets voting certain laws without justification point view contagions really find unacceptable never able talk house always confidence measures opportunity talk cannot pretend help families aberrant standards adopted mothers children
#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President I am speaking on the order of business with regard to what Mr Parrini has said I recall that this decree law of 26 November which introduces compulsory vaccination for police school staff and other measures was largely exceeded by the decree laws of 24 and 30 December and 7 January The amendments were tabled with a deadline not extended of 14 December Since then it has been twenty nine days and we have not yet been able to begin the examination of the amendments because we must agree with the majority We were supposed to start work at 3:00 yesterday There has been a delay to this day for this reason but at 9 a .m. we did not even have a second discussion about the absence of the government There was clearly no intention since the representative of the Government who had every right to stay wherever he wanted was in the corridor outside the Commission 's courtroom The Constitution and decency say that the laws are discussed in the House or in the Commission in front of the citizens with a record and not in endless negotiations in the majority or in the context of whomever you want This is fine it is normal that it should happen but a minimum of decency should be respected in time because these measures have a huge impact on the lives of Italians and cannot be discussed in the corridors to the total detriment of the possibility of examining them where they can be voted where the Constitution stipulates that we should vote in the Commission and in the House In fact it does not escape that it seems that the discussion of the decree law is going to be exhausted today because tomorrow there is no sitting It is all reserved for the corridor and nothing arrives in its own institutional headquarters in a situation in which moreover we examine a decree law that has been largely exceeded by all the others if not for some details on which they manage to nail themselves All right I can also understand the problems of the majority but it is done in accordance with timetables decency and the need to examine measures in the Commission and in this House not in corridors not in private negotiations or in private negotiations,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,11.945959,-21.003931,1,mr malan fdi mr president speaking order business regard mr parrini said recall decree law 26 november introduces compulsory vaccination police school staff measures largely exceeded decree laws 24 30 december 7 january amendments tabled deadline extended 14 december since twenty nine days yet able begin examination amendments must agree majority supposed start work 3:00 yesterday delay day reason 9 .m. even second discussion absence government clearly intention since representative government every right stay wherever wanted corridor outside commission 's courtroom constitution decency say laws discussed house commission front citizens record endless negotiations majority context whomever want fine normal happen minimum decency respected time measures huge impact lives italians cannot discussed corridors total detriment possibility examining voted constitution stipulates vote commission house fact escape seems discussion decree law going exhausted today tomorrow sitting reserved corridor nothing arrives institutional headquarters situation moreover examine decree law largely exceeded others details manage nail right also understand problems majority done accordance timetables decency need examine measures commission house corridors private negotiations private negotiations
#MalanLucio,In the same previous spirit with the intention of establishing the conditions for moving forward Article 7 provides that the prefects shall draw up a report on the activity carried out for the control of green passes by all the Forces of the Order in coordination with the local police and so on Now because the control of green passes is not the only problem in our country if this is to be done with our amendments we propose several measures while the report is omitted because if there is a minimum of confidence in the prefects perhaps it is better to let them work rather than make them produce cards with great use of the copy and paste from one side to the other At least it could be expected that instead of weekly the report is monthly to have a little less bureaucracy since apparently the only problem of public order in our country is the lack of green passes But the proposal we are most concerned with is that the report not only concerns the control of green passes but also the whole of the activities carried out to protect citizens and to respect the laws highlighting in this area the extent of the controls referred to in the previous period namely the famous control of green passes If you run after all green passes but drug dealing continues to be a free market commercial abuse is on all roads including those of the Capital a few steps away from the palaces of the institutions the rave parties continue to hold themselves with such laxity that they also come from abroad to celebrate these orgies of drugs and not only with rapes and sometimes even murders well it would be appropriate to keep that in mind too because the green pass should not be the only problem,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,9.4600525,-22.081266,1,previous spirit intention establishing conditions moving forward article 7 provides prefects shall draw report activity carried control green passes forces order coordination local police control green passes problem country done amendments propose several measures report omitted minimum confidence prefects perhaps better let work rather make produce cards great use copy paste one side least could expected instead weekly report monthly little less bureaucracy since apparently problem public order country lack green passes proposal concerned report concerns control green passes also whole activities carried protect citizens respect laws highlighting area extent controls referred previous period namely famous control green passes run green passes drug dealing continues free market commercial abuse roads including capital steps away palaces institutions rave parties continue hold laxity also come abroad celebrate orgies drugs rapes sometimes even murders well would appropriate keep mind green pass problem
#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President Amendment 1.24 and a number of other subsequent amendments call for the measures dictated by the emergency to be equated so much so that they are explicitly justified as such in the premises and are part of a decree law which by definition must be of extraordinary necessity and urgency We do not understand why these and other rules introduced by the provision often last until 15 June when at the time of the enactment of the decree law the state of emergency ended long before and now ends anyway on 31 March Evidently there is a tendency to end emergency never,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,11.452622,-19.46681,1,mr malan fdi mr president amendment 1.24 number subsequent amendments call measures dictated emergency equated much explicitly justified premises part decree law definition must extraordinary necessity urgency understand rules introduced provision often last 15 june time enactment decree law state emergency ended long ends anyway 31 march evidently tendency end emergency never
#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President Article 2 introduces the vaccination obligation for categories such as police forces in which there are several cases and one which is quite well known I am referring to the Marshal of the special departments of the Carabinieri in service in Codogno in February March 2020 who has endangered his life even if the Carabiniere must obey the orders in the conditions we know then the disease was unknown and was considered even more dangerous than it then turned out to be Yet it was very dangerous and we know well how many deaths there have been in that area in particular with a mortality that even reached 7 10 percent of the infected These are the conditions in which this marshal worked Since at that time he contracted the disease from which he was cured he felt that he was not reunited during this period and consequently was suspended from service I say this to outline the picture Amendment 2.29 at the first signature of Senator Rauti and others at the first signature of Senator Iannone and at my first signature go in the same direction If the vaccination obligation for the police forces and for the other categories for which it is intended serves to contain the contagions despite the very poor results which I would call failures in recent months then it is necessary for the people who actually go to work and therefore are in contact with colleagues or other people and not already for those who are at home on sickness or maternity leave It is good to know that despite the fact that Mr Lamorgese answered one of my questions in the Commission saying that this was not the case this is the case You must know that if a woman who is pregnant or on compulsory maternity leave is not vaccinated her salary is suspended even if she may be the only livelihood she has I repeat this is true even if it is at home and has no contact with colleagues Firstly there is a lack of motivation Secondly I find that taking away the livelihood of a woman in maternity even if she was a dangerous criminal is something I avoid defining with the word I have in mind simply saying that it should not be done on matters of elementary humanity I 'll add one more element We have tabled these amendments all of which have been rejected without any explanation The Budget Committee has given an opinion against Article 81 of the Constitution arguing that if these amendments were to pass extra money would have to be taken out to give the salary to the maternity women involved This means therefore that these women must not vaccinate because otherwise there is no cover Is n't that right Mr. and Mrs. Budgetary Committee Even if they were to vaccinate there would be no resources to pay their wages Then the government is saying that these women are deprived of their livelihood but that if they are vaccinated there is no money Actually here we go beyond any limit of logic and frankly even of elementary humanity,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,14.500813,-22.47753,1,mr malan fdi mr president article 2 introduces vaccination obligation categories police forces several cases one quite well known referring marshal special departments carabinieri service codogno february march 2020 endangered life even carabiniere must obey orders conditions know disease unknown considered even dangerous turned yet dangerous know well many deaths area particular mortality even reached 7 10 percent infected conditions marshal worked since time contracted disease cured felt reunited period consequently suspended service say outline picture amendment 2.29 first signature senator rauti others first signature senator iannone first signature go direction vaccination obligation police forces categories intended serves contain contagions despite poor results would call failures recent months necessary people actually go work therefore contact colleagues people already home sickness maternity leave good know despite fact mr lamorgese answered one questions commission saying case case must know woman pregnant compulsory maternity leave vaccinated salary suspended even may livelihood repeat true even home contact colleagues firstly lack motivation secondly find taking away livelihood woman maternity even dangerous criminal something avoid defining word mind simply saying done matters elementary humanity 'll add one element tabled amendments rejected without explanation budget committee given opinion article 81 constitution arguing amendments pass extra money would taken give salary maternity women involved means therefore women must vaccinate otherwise cover n't right mr. mrs. budgetary committee even vaccinate would resources pay wages government saying women deprived livelihood vaccinated money actually go beyond limit logic frankly even elementary humanity

#FerreroRoberta,Mr President I will take four if I can Dear colleagues Government I thank the speakers and of course the Government in the people of the Undersecretary War and undersecretary Freni I would also like to thank the offices for the commitment that in the proliferation of measures for two years now is particularly intense But let me say ladies and gentlemen that in four years we have learned nothing in the management of the work It is true that among very diverse political forces majority agreements become complicated But in any case we should all agree that we should not be able to finish work at night this time even in the night between Sunday and Monday It is not a problem for us but more than anything else it is a problem of work the work done at night risks being not serious and leading to mistakes which although small must inevitably be settled later I will never tire of saying that at night we should sleep and not work on important measures Having said that it can be said that the measure in question is in the right direction With it the Government has begun to accept the requests received in particular by our Group and our secretary Matteo Salvini who had not been suspicious since time had warned about the dangers of increases and energy increases It is certainly a good start to take further wider measures That is why I will not dwell so much on what we are going to approve in my speech Moreover many of the amendments we have signed including through cross-cutting agreements have received the Government 's favourable opinion and the Commission 's vote in favour On the other hand I would like to raise awareness of all of you ladies and gentlemen about what is the real plan and the institutional plan that is two plans that are difficult to meet We are all aware of the increases in the cost of raw materials energy and inevitably the shopping cart but entrepreneurs were aware of the phenomenon of the increase of raw materials since the beginning of 2021 So ladies and gentlemen this epilogue was inevitable partly because we may not have been able to hear enough Then everything went down and was accelerated by the war of course but the assumptions were already evident We need to learn to pick up the signals that the real world gives us There is a part of this Parliament that seeing evaders everywhere and the clever around every corner believes that with laces and laces they hinder these twists But that political part often does not realize that the complications of procedures do nothing but facilitate bureaucracy professionals and smart people who know how to circumvent the rules So listen to the entrepreneurs of those healthy companies those companies that work honestly Mine wants to be an appeal for the next steps At this serious time of economic crisis it is not so important to give but to avoid removing to avoid collecting as has been done for excise duties on fuels on the other hand Let us simplify the procedures let us lower taxation for companies and workers because only then will they be able to deal with the economic problems also due to the conflict but we still do not hear them today because

#BalboniAlberto,Mr President ladies and gentlemen the Brothers of Italy Group has submitted the question for a preliminary ruling in order to request that the articles of the draft law in question be not examined If the law and in particular Article 24 of the Civil Protection Code provides that the state of emergency must have a maximum duration of 12 months prorogable in extraordinary and exceptional cases for a further 12 months there will be a reason Moreover the legislator has set quite wide limits because I remind everyone this rule is from 2018 and previously the maximum time limit was three months then extended to six months and finally in 2018 to twelve plus twelve months The state of emergency as the word itself says has a meaning to cope with unpredictable and exceptional situations With the decree law that today we are called to convert the Government after an innumerable series of similar measures it has actually normalized the emergency The state of emergency is however an extremely serious measure that compresses fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution including freedom of movement and enterprise Precisely because these are constitutional principles these can reasonably be compressed only in a comparative judgment before precisely exceptional situations Unfortunately the pandemic lasted for many months also because of the inability of the government to face it with appropriate measures because it has focused everything and only on the vaccine And we have forgotten the home and timely care we have forgotten those preventive measures that we of Brothers of Italy have constantly asked unheard to secure transport to make the FFP2 mask compulsory in crowded places in means of transport in metropolitans and especially on regional trains ventilation in schools We have been asking for this for months and only in the last period at last have you begun to agree with us hypocritically pretending to ignore from those who came such proposals for too long unheard,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,12.435932,-19.817133,1,mr president ladies gentlemen brothers italy group submitted question preliminary ruling order request articles draft law question examined law particular article 24 civil protection code provides state emergency must maximum duration 12 months prorogable extraordinary exceptional cases 12 months reason moreover legislator set quite wide limits remind everyone rule 2018 previously maximum time limit three months extended six months finally 2018 twelve plus twelve months state emergency word says meaning cope unpredictable exceptional situations decree law today called convert government innumerable series similar measures actually normalized emergency state emergency however extremely serious measure compresses fundamental rights enshrined constitution including freedom movement enterprise precisely constitutional principles reasonably compressed comparative judgment precisely exceptional situations unfortunately pandemic lasted many months also inability government face appropriate measures focused everything vaccine forgotten home timely care forgotten preventive measures brothers italy constantly asked unheard secure transport make ffp2 mask compulsory crowded places means transport metropolitans especially regional trains ventilation schools asking months last period last begun agree us hypocritically pretending ignore came proposals long unheard
#BalboniAlberto,Please Senator Balboni continue Balboni FdI Thank you very much Mr President But as we know the voice of the only opposition in this House is now seen as an annoyance and I believe that all our colleagues from the far left to the right are demonstrating this we are an annoyance and I apologize if we continue to insist on believing in democracy I apologize if we continue to believe that this House should also be a place of confrontation between different opinions but this is the role that we have carved out and I think that if you do not listen to us the Italians will listen to us To continue my speech I wonder what is the point of continuing with the emergency with more than 90 of vaccinees and if we consider the cured we reach 95 of the immunized population What sense does it have as you do with this decree law to continue to clutter rules on increasingly confused increasingly contradictory increasingly complicated norms It will take a hundred page manual now for every citizen to know how he can go shopping how he can go to the cinema or theater travel on the means of transport and exercise the minimum constitutional freedoms that should always be guaranteed to him The vaccination obligation for all citizens over fifty years of age even for those who live in the countryside for the couple of pensioners who legitimately choose not to have social contacts for a farmer who works outdoors or for a family business where there are only parents and children and not strangers is one of the absolutely unreasonable rules standards that all over Europe and the world are now starting to cancel and that you want to repeat instead Take care this is not only a problem of constitutional freedom but also of economics because tourism in Italy is worth or perhaps it was worth 13 14 15 percent of GDP and now throughout Europe and the world are planning Easter and summer holidays Then I put myself in the role of a tourist who comes from abroad and reads that in Italy there is still the state of emergency and needs the super green pass to do the shopping to be able to move and to enter the restaurants and then the super green pass and the negative buffer This afternoon a negative buffer will also have to be presented in order to enter this House but how Mr Draghi did n't you say that with the green pass there was absolute security to be safe to be safe So what 's the point of swabming if you 're safe with the super green pass In order to enter this House today we will have to present a negative buffer done even on the same day This means that perhaps we were right listening to those experts who told us that the vaccine does not prevent the circulation of the virus that you can get infected and be infected even if you have the third dose and unfortunately as demonstrated by the dramatic situation of Israel even if you have the fourth dose It made sense then to ask for all the measures we did not listen to and on which only today you finally began to reason We are giving a message to tourists all over the world inviting them to go to Spain where they can do what they want or to England where they can do the same either in Greece or everywhere but not in Italy You are creating the condition of killing for the third consecutive year one of the main factors of development and gross domestic product which is Italian tourism That is why ladies and gentlemen we have tabled the question for a preliminary ruling By now you have all joined the politically correct You 've all accepted the religion of the green pass It is no longer a question of pragmatic reasoning about what is useful and what is not It is no longer a question of balancing the various interests that are also in the field because there is certainly an interest in health we are the first to say that health must be absolutely protected but there is also an interest in the economy Today the whole world is trying to get out of this dilemma to ensure that economic recovery is absolutely necessary And instead you continue with this religion for which it is no longer possible to discuss the matter Dear President let me conclude with one consideration it is truly scandalous that the children or rather the daughters of two political leaders Giorgia Meloni and Matteo Salvini have entered into the debate these days Priests of the politically correct religion are not ashamed either of dragging into political controversy an individual choice of parents who together with doctors and pediatricians are free to choose without becoming the subject of political debate or worse And I 'm also referring to PD colleagues like Senator Marcucci who should be ashamed,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#BalboniAlberto,Balboni FdI Mr President I apologize if I disturb you My colleagues say that is enough but I think I have to do my duty if they do not want to do so then it is their problem Mr President I asked to speak in an explanation of vote on Rule 26 because having proposed an amendment to delete it as you rightly pointed out we do not vote on the amendment proposal but on the retention of the article so we will vote against this article which increases the number of co-ordinated and continuous collaboration contracts within the MSC in an excessive way It 's about that present to the currents I 've been talking about in general discussion We increase the number of members of the MSC by 20 when we voted for the reduction in the number of Members of Parliament by 37 the logic would have liked that if the issue was the containment of expenditure a corresponding reduction should also be made of the other constitutional bodies or bodies of constitutional importance as in the case of the MSM I am not saying that it would have been appropriate to make a reduction of 37.7 but perhaps a quarter or a fifth as we propose with our amendments The subject is not only the greatest cost of increasing the number of members but as anyone who reads Article 26 understands the cost of the enormous increase in the corresponding staff Today the maximum limit for external recruitment is 26 see case by case approving this article the number becomes 62 more than double So I wonder about the logic of spending containment If this is not a gift to the currents tell me what it is because I modestly cannot find another answer For these reasons I announce Brothers of Italy 's vote against Article 26,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,4.5995927,-21.032194,1,balboni fdi mr president apologize disturb colleagues say enough think duty want problem mr president asked speak explanation vote rule 26 proposed amendment delete rightly pointed vote amendment proposal retention article vote article increases number co-ordinated continuous collaboration contracts within msc excessive way 's present currents 've talking general discussion increase number members msc 20 voted reduction number members parliament 37 logic would liked issue containment expenditure corresponding reduction also made constitutional bodies bodies constitutional importance case msm saying would appropriate make reduction 37.7 perhaps quarter fifth propose amendments subject greatest cost increasing number members anyone reads article 26 understands cost enormous increase corresponding staff today maximum limit external recruitment 26 see case case approving article number becomes 62 double wonder logic spending containment gift currents tell modestly cannot find another answer reasons announce brothers italy 's vote article 26
#RomeoMassimiliano,ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President I am speaking on the same subject as my previous colleague because today on 15 February the rule of vaccination for those over 50 years of age has come into force and therefore the duty to present the so called enhanced green pass to go to work Without going into the merits of the measure itself I know that in Parliament as in the country as in the Government there are different sensibilities and I respect them all However we would like to stress something that should concern both you Mr President and the Presidency Council as well as the Government itself At an acute stage of the pandemic whether it pleases or not certain restrictive measures of personal freedom which even touch a constitutional right such as that at work can find their justification At a stage such as the current one which according to experts is now endemic and no longer acute certain measures have no real reason to be We therefore wish the government well but not only that since then Parliament is us I am addressing all my colleagues in all the parties let us reason and try to understand well what is happening in the light of the economic situation the energy crisis rising inflation prices including food prices are now skyrocketing and those who go to the market and shop know what I am talking about and the entrepreneurial fabric that is likely to close Can we afford to leave a million unpaid workers at home This is a reflection we make to the Assembly and to the Government We are the people 's representatives because if the rules apply to citizens they also apply to Members of Parliament That must be clear A popular saying says that hunger infuses courage and we must be careful not to create a spiral of social tensions that can be very very harmful not only for the economy of our country but also for the social estate,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,14.7924185,-19.488503,1,romeo l sp psd az mr president speaking subject previous colleague today 15 february rule vaccination 50 years age come force therefore duty present called enhanced green pass go work without going merits measure know parliament country government different sensibilities respect however would like stress something concern mr president presidency council well government acute stage pandemic whether pleases certain restrictive measures personal freedom even touch constitutional right work find justification stage current one according experts endemic longer acute certain measures real reason therefore wish government well since parliament us addressing colleagues parties let us reason try understand well happening light economic situation energy crisis rising inflation prices including food prices skyrocketing go market shop know talking entrepreneurial fabric likely close afford leave million unpaid workers home reflection make assembly government people 's representatives rules apply citizens also apply members parliament must clear popular saying says hunger infuses courage must careful create spiral social tensions harmful economy country also social estate
#RomeoMassimiliano,Mr President more than a comment on these two decree laws because they are two merged into one which were thought a while ago it was December 28th and there was a very different epidemiological situation it was the peak of infection death and hospitalization I am about to express a kind of hope towards the members of the Government who are present here First of all since the epidemiological picture has changed there has been a collapse fortunately dizzying of cases so hospitals are starting to breathe and intensive therapies have decreased it is good that the government begins to change strategy Probably at a certain stage the most acute of the pandemic the green pass and the super green pass were used to vaccinate citizens So we say once and for all it is a surreptitious obligation More obligation this than the obligation imposed by law At least we 're clear we 're telling each other and we 're avoiding hypocrisies Now that 90 of citizens over 12 are vaccinated I say this to the Undersecretary those who are vaccinated are vaccinated while those who are not vaccinated will hardly be vaccinated with the obligations they have entered As we can see from the number of first daily doses these are no longer the obligations that can convince the rest Perhaps it is better to convince the so called hesitant avoid the iron fist that perhaps compacts them among themselves and above all scares them but seek dialogue and confrontation We will never tire of saying it dialogue and confrontation If the data continues to improve as we all hope if the virus becomes endemic and you go towards the end of the state of emergency you have to start thinking of loosening the restrictions you also have to start thinking of storing the green pass starting with the super green pass Why do I say that Let us look at what is happening in other countries in Europe and outside In Great Britain from 21 February Covid 19 will be declared a flu like disease in Denmark stop to masks and green passes the Covid 19 is no longer a socially critical disease in France they will recall the super green pass So is it plausible that in a week instead in Italy we force people to vaccinate otherwise we stop them from going to work Is it plausible to think that a representative of the people cannot enter Parliament if he is not vaccinated Let 's think about it Let 's talk about this The citizens must all be the same Therefore we also give the non-Vaccinated to work and the non-Vaccinated to come to Parliament to carry out their duties which have been assigned to them by the Constitution We hope that the Government will intervene in this direction also because compared to the abolition of the green pass there are also many trivaccinate who are tired of having to present every time the pass in order to carry out their work and all the activities that everyday life requires In addition over time the risk is also that our economy will be damaged rather than in some way favored We are thinking above all of the tourism sector So the sooner we get back to normal the sooner we get rid of the pass the sooner we get our economy back on track Above all let 's look at the numbers carefully Here again I address the Undersecretary looking at the real numbers and drawing the right conclusions because you cannot continue to consider dead for Covid 19 those who did not die because of the Covid 19 but who died from other evils and had also done a positive buffer as the World Health Organization had suggested Not to mention some hospital that rigs the data as the Restart survey on Rai 2 explained clearly basically to have more resources and more money We know in fact that the patients of Covid 19 are being renovated both economically and at the hospital level in a greater way than in many other situations Mr. Undersecretary and members of the government the picture is now heading towards the end of the pandemic We all hope so and hope so but the impression is that if we listened to the CTS the emergency would last fifteen years It is understandable why if there is no longer an emergency the role of the CTS also diminishes and therefore those who are part of it would probably no longer be directly involved in the first person as it is now It is humanly understandable but beware such a thing would feed a culture of suspicion until yesterday unjustified Some would be entitled to think that people want to get used to surveillance and we hope that that is not the goal Politics is once again the protagonist taking back the space that has been left to doctors at this stage Politics must once again be a protagonist using common sense and reasonableness I say it out of the teeth we consider it a great exaggeration to remove salaries and pensions social life and even deny treatment to those who have not been vaccinated We have always treated rightly I add murderers and illegals because they are people and I remember these words sculpted If an Italian citizen decides not to vaccinate what do we do Are n't we gonna cure him and let him starve to death Excuse me but as Christians perhaps we should all ask ourselves a few questions If this is the so called new humanism then we should call it inhumanity Excuse me but it should be Bassetti talks about pacification Crisanti says that today chasing those who do not want to vaccinate does not serve and would not change anything Francesco Vaia director of Spallanzani said to free cities from fear restoring the joy of living The obsession with Covid is generating insecurity and aggression We are careful because people want to return to normal and we cannot talk about normalities by associating it with free tablets,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#RomeoMassimiliano,ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President first of all I would like to point out that it would be more appropriate when discussing a decree law to talk about it directly and not perhaps in general about the importance of vaccinations or the green pass as did those who intervened before me retracing the whole history of the pandemic Let us rest rather on the decree under consideration which was issued in the first days of January which we will of course vote on because trust has been placed and we will vote on it for a sense of responsibility as we have always done because we have always responded to responsibility by people and by the responsible political group It is certain however that if there had been no confidence and we had to vote on the measure we would probably have abstained As already in the Chamber of Deputies in fact we have highlighted some criticalities of this decree- law starting from the fact that perhaps the obligation of vaccination for the over 50 and for those at risk would have been better to predict it a little before January 7 Among other things this measure today becomes somewhat anachronistic because two months ago it could have its justifications on the basis of the very alarming data in terms of both death occupation of intensive therapies and hospitalizations while today we are fortunately in a completely different situation There is however another element that justifies our perplexities because these are critical issues that have also highlighted our ministers within the Government namely the issue of DAD for non-vaccined children This decree provides that children between five and eleven years of age who are not vaccinated will end up in DAD compared to those who are vaccinated This is discrimination indeed let us be clear it is a masked obligation that we have not shared first of all because we are talking about children Among other things someone I say this to Undersecretary Sileri must explain to us why there is all this insistence on children from five to eleven years old only in Italy when caution is preached throughout Europe or at least vaccination is advised to children if they are fragile if they have certain diseases or if immunodepressed We would like to understand why this happens only in Italy also because then there is a recent study conducted in eleven states of the United States that shows that children between the five and the eleven years are hospitalized more for the influence than for the Covid because then you have to go to check all the data well We understand the obligation for the over 50 and for a population group that was undoubtedly particularly at risk but this insistence on children someone has to explain it to us There is also another subject that has been introduced in this decree with an amendment the difference in treatment between Italians and foreigners If a foreigner arrives in Italy and has had two doses of vaccine for more than six months just the swab and can easily enter the hotel or go to the restaurant The Italian citizen cannot do this because if he has taken two doses or had a cure and it has been six months the super green pass expires It is right to help tourism we would be missing something else we have the Minister for Tourism and we are the first to be satisfied from this point of view but we cannot discriminate between a European citizen and an Italian citizen The point as I said is not so much this decree law itself but it is what will happen at the end of the state of emergency Gentlemen Undersecretaries Minister Hope if the emergency ends what will happen from April 1st This chronoprogram for which you gradually get to the date of June 15 does not stand if the emergency ends on March 31 the legal basis of the green pass fails This is what we need to highlight Otherwise the green pass becomes a political tool and no longer a health instrument If we are not in emergency why keep the super green pass green pass and more In fact it is the same virologists who advise given that the situation at the moment has improved considerably and it is assumed that at the end of March it will be even better to give freedom to the citizens since we do not know what could happen in October We hope that everything will be fine and that the pandemic will be over but we can possibly think of restrictions if things do not go well in the autumn This is the period in which to guarantee freedom and serenity to the whole population Now is the time to do so and not arrive until June What does it mean to remove the super green pass for outdoor restaurants It 's a joke Do things right also because already now with the state of emergency of the sentences of the TAR of Lazio have suspended the provision of non-wage to those who do not want to vaccinate because the judges consider necessary a balance between the constitutional principle of health protection and the right to sustenance At this stage with the arrival of the war with all the economic difficulties and the increase of the bills we can think of it as we want but if one does not want to vaccinate it is unreasonable to take away his salary and not let him work I repeat it is unreasonable Mr. Undersecretary everyone here thinks the same way almost everyone Do not abuse the patience of citizens and Parliament because there is a unity of consensus Since 1 April there will be some measures in this House and there will be some votes in this House So tell that to Minister Hope among other things founder of the party called Article One Article 1 of the Constitution states that Italy is a democratic Republic founded on labour But he 's the first to take the job off Remember him with elegance and politeness because we know his character So there would be more use all the precautions but remind him since he is still the secretary of that party I have spoken about compensations about the fact that this is the right time about not abusing the patience of the Italians and of Parliament but above all I wanted to say this is the issue that at a particular moment of difficulty of acute phase of the pandemic there is a need for restrictive measures But if things go better and everyone rightly thinks that we must fight to defend democracy and freedom let us begin to defend the freedom of our fellow countrymen I conclude by saying also to the Ministry itself that the Covid 19 is there Nobody denies that Prudence and caution but we cannot as a country be obsessed with Covid 19 What 's the result The alarm cry of Italian oncology associations with screenings that were almost all blocked I quote data There is a risk that in the coming years from now to 2040 there will be a 32 increase in cancers precisely because screening is not done for a whole range of reasons because we need to swab and because hospitals are occupied by something else We work on this as we work on the Law Lorenzin I have asked several questions and have them also presented to the Parent Company in 12a Commission Senator Fregolent The law passed by Parliament on 22 December 2017 provided for significant benefits for research into paediatric cancers Until now Mr Undersecretaries and Mr Ministers the implementing decrees have not yet been enacted How is that possible Just the battle just all the effort I thank the Ministry for everything that has been done in the fight against Covid 19 and for everything that you continue to do Colleagues however does not exist only the Covid 19 You die from many other pathologies and there are many children who would need those implementing decrees,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,14.018033,-20.915615,1,romeo l sp psd az mr president first would like point

#RomeoMassimiliano,"Mr President in thanking all my colleagues I would point out that it is certainly not my intention to waste this House 's time I should have spoken in the general debate yesterday but the commitments of these days have not allowed me to do so So I try quickly to recover during the discussion on trust This is a decree that goes towards normality and which has the title Superation of measures against the pandemic following the cessation of the state of emergency it is in itself good news and we are absolutely happy about it as we are also voting on a decree that goes in that direction The point of my speech is that we hope not to be accused of mischievous majesty if we allow ourselves to say that an opportunity has been missed This could have been the right opportunity in the light of the cessation of the state of emergency to make a picture of clear and precise measures of precise provisions to be maintained on the subject of the pandemic Unfortunately there has been some chaos in certain cases For example on the question of masks there is some uncertainty we can say about the use yes to the mask if the place of work is public while it is recommended if the place is private as if there were a difference and as if the virus hit on one side rather than the other yes to the mask in the business canteens and public work no to the masks in the restaurants yes to the mask in a sports structure indoors like the Palaeur or the Forum of Assago even if there is a gap no to the mask in a stadium with 70,000 people all crushed assembled without any distance I mean these are measures that leave at least some debate It is said no to the mask for children up to six years old but for six years up yes to the mask on flights with Italian license we should put the mask while on other European flights no here too some question should be asked In class I 'm talking about schools the mask is maintained but then the same children go out go to the sports center to the bar play together hug as is right they make all their games and the mask is not expected In short the logic of such choices honestly is a little 'all to understand In some cases we can say that there are also situations at the limit of ridicule such as for example what will happen on aircraft also in the light of the choices made by the European Safety Agency I 'd say it 's gonna be pretty peculiar Minister Hope told us that however science decides they are not political choices but science decides But when a group of parents and associations sent a formal request to the Ministry to see if there is a study that highlights risks and benefits on the issue of masks imposed from the six years up there has even arrived a written response from the Director General of the Prevention of the Ministry of Health who said that the Ministry does not have any study Then the question is are certain technical choices as the Minister calls them daughters of science or propaganda sold as science In this chaos about using the mask in uncertainty what does a person do It often happens to me too when I enter a place I wonder whether or not I have to wear it like at the supermarket or at the airport In uncertainty I put the mask rightly also to avoid running into some violation of the rules or even simply because I fear that people may look at me badly That 's what kind of happens So the question is is this chaos the result of negligence operational difficulties Covid bureaucracy as someone calls it or is it a precise strategy to get used to the gag These are the answers that must be given We have always supported the choices made by the government and thank him for all the work he has done It is not easy to deal with such situations but it is also true that it is equally necessary for the minister responsible to give answers to the many questions that our Group has tabled in recent months to ask for explanations light on the so called scientific evidence explaining also why we are asking on this occasion since the Secretary is also present the whole European Union has downgraded the virus as an influence while we continue to wear masks We just need to know why Explain it to us I am not saying that the European Union is right and that we are wrong and that we are wrong We just want answers Perhaps and we also say this in the light of what will happen in the autumn it would be good to try to focus attention as many experts have already pointed out in numerous newspapers elderly and fragile Those who must be protected not only now but also after are the elderly and the fragile Nevertheless many times both in the Chamber and in the Commissions in dealing with the issue of fragile people we have not had all the attention to promote smart working and meet certain needs in order to protect precisely the fragility which I think is the primary objective that the Government should pursue even from a future perspective We are happy and happy to convert a decree for overcoming the measures against the pandemic even if we need a lot of caution and we must be careful because the pandemic has not been defeated at all There are some answers that have remained unanswered and we also want to understand why Italy maintains a road not exactly similar to that of other European countries since here we are always talking about the European Union and we are said to be united and working together From this point of view it would perhaps be appropriate to adopt at least common strategies to combat the pandemic adapting a little to the choices that are made elsewhere That is our wish It is true that we are faced with yet another vote of confidence but we also understand that the processing times of the decrees are unfortunately very long We would have preferred not to be trusted but we understand that such choices are important and this fundamental decree Therefore as announced in the explanation of vote our vote will be very much in favour However we wanted to highlight a number of observations Let 's hope we 're not accused of mischievous majesty That is our final wish",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#BriziarelliLuca,"BRIZIERELLI L- SP PSd Az Mr President I have asked to speak in order to bring to your attention and to the attention of the House what has been happening since yesterday afternoon and is still happening in the former Malagrotta dump It is a huge fire devastating which first involved a shed then the still gasifier then the conveyor belt and finally the entire mechanical biological treatment system TMB It is a plant that treats 900 of the 3,000 tons a day that Rome produces It is obvious therefore that the first thought goes to the people who have been torn apart for years in that area which I would like to remind you is the only one in Central and South which is subject to the Seveso dioxin directive I would ask for some respect not so much for me but for the population and for the more than 40 firemen who are trying to control a fire that seems indomitable in these hours They have intervened and are still intervening first eight then 12 and then 16 means even special of firefighters It is these hours a draconian order of the mayor of Rome that establishes a zone of respect of 6 kilometers closes the kindergartens schools prohibits the consumption of food asks the people who are one kilometer from the plant to stay locked in the house The first thought goes to them but then there are two fundamental considerations that we have a duty to carry out The first is that it is the third fire of a waste treatment plant in four years in Rome On December 11 2018 a fire completely destroyed the TMB salary which at that time contained 3,000 tons of garbage for three days the cameras did not work who knows why a disaster announced On March 24 2019 a fire hit the TMB of Rocca Cencia which contained almost 500 tons in that case the cameras were not even there as there was no smoke detection system These tragedies are announced on which we have also acted and asked for attention as a Commission of Inquiry into the illicit activities related to the waste cycle and the related environmental offences The second consideration concerns the plants in Rome and Lazio It is not just a question of understanding where we are going to bring 900 tonnes of waste from now on which risks bringing waste management to its knees in Rome but of understanding why we are still stuck to a waste management plan that is that of the Polverini junta because the plan for the management of the plant has just been approved even if Zingaretti has been president since 2013 Someone must explain to us also because it is Parliament 's duty to intervene if a Region does not succeed how one can on the one hand unanimously approve the request for Rome Capital to enter into the Constitution and then not be able to provide it with a waste management plant worthy of a civil country and have a political force like the 5 Stars crying out for scandal and threatening a crisis of government because an amendment has been inserted that provides special powers and rapid times to realize a thermovaluer in Lazio in Rome before the Jubilee Let us have some consistency let us do what every Italian citizen has the right to have In order to protect the environment it is not enough to write it in the Constitution in order to protect health from dioxin risk it is not enough to say it in words the facts are needed it is necessary to move to a serious plant in Rome Lazio

#AugussoriLuigi,Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President I too would like to join in the invitation to deliver a written text but having no written text I cannot help but recall that this decree was born in mid-December at the height of the pandemic Thus it served to give a round of lives and to give greater protection for what then occurred namely an impressive peak of the contagions Luckily many intensive therapies have had a much lower growth than in the past and this is also thanks to vaccines and we must remember that As however there has been responsibility on the part of a large part of Parliament also on the part of my Group to acknowledge the need for this round of lives we ask that with equal fairness and equal responsibility the other part of Parliament also acknowledge that a new phase is now beginning A phase begins when certain restrictive measures need to be relaxed starting with the super green pass because we can finally see the light outside the tunnel If the data of the last few weeks are confirmed we can say that finally the emergent pandemic phase will be exceeded and we can be part of the ordinary management phase That is our wish As far as the decree law is concerned I can only mention briefly the improving action we have taken in the Commission on issues such as those of fragile workers and air purifiers for schools as well as the important agenda also mentioned by our Parent Company which has committed the Government to identifying the relaxation of restrictive measures starting from the overcoming of the super green pass My group will therefore vote in favour of this measure,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,13.8962145,-19.694075,1,mr agussori l sp psd az mr president would like join invitation deliver written text written text cannot help recall decree born mid-december height pandemic thus served give round lives give greater protection occurred namely impressive peak contagions luckily many intensive therapies much lower growth past also thanks vaccines must remember however responsibility part large part parliament also part group acknowledge need round lives ask equal fairness equal responsibility part parliament also acknowledge new phase beginning phase begins certain restrictive measures need relaxed starting super green pass finally see light outside tunnel data last weeks confirmed say finally emergent pandemic phase exceeded part ordinary management phase wish far decree law concerned mention briefly improving action taken commission issues fragile workers air purifiers schools well important agenda also mentioned parent company committed government identifying relaxation restrictive measures starting overcoming super green pass group therefore vote favour measure
#AugussoriLuigi,Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President on the agenda G1100 which was approved by the Commission which was first signed by me following the withdrawal of amendment 1.4 again by the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group at my first signature I would ask you as has already been the case in the Commission to put the agenda to the vote in order to give greater strength to the message contained in it The agenda under discussion is a commitment that is being asked of the Government which has allowed it to be given and therefore the vote is an act that gives more force to the Commission itself in carrying out its commitment relating to compensation for any damage caused by recommended vaccinations We know that compulsory vaccines provide compensation in the event of damage With the recent measures imposed by the Government has extended the audience of persons subject to vaccination obligation which is close to 30 million I do not have an exact figure including all over fifty and all persons engaged in the health system law enforcement and education who are covered by the law providing compensation At the moment people who do not have an obligation are still excluded but have a strong recommendation to vaccination It is a battle that as a Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione we have carried on since the beginning of the vaccination campaign We have tabled this amendment over and over again which unfortunately has never been successful This time also by virtue of a decision of the Constitutional Court the rest of the parliamentary groups joined our initiative and as you have seen wrote through their Leader the signature on this agenda resulting from amendment 1.4 It is fair to say that there were also other amendments by the other majority and opposition forces as Mr Malan said So there was a strong convergence There were therefore all the conditions for approving the amendment already in the measure under consideration Unfortunately again due to a lack of some technicians from the Ministry of Economics and Finance or Accounting we have not yet quite understood it it has not been possible to improve the coverage in good time So let 's refer to the next useful measure which the Government will take next week on this there is a clear commitment from the Government at the highest level We therefore believe that the agenda is a very good success because the issue will be resolved next week even before the possible conversion of the decree law in question which could take place in the House of Deputies in seven days time It is therefore the shortest route which allows us to solve a problem which is attended by so many citizens So the government 's commitment is clear The hope is that it will be confirmed and that justice will be done for those who are damaged by a vaccine which has been strongly suggested and recommended by the State,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,13.762116,-21.709848,1,mr agussori l sp psd az mr president agenda g1100 approved commission first signed following withdrawal amendment 1.4 lega salvini premier partito sardo d'azione group first signature would ask already case commission put agenda vote order give greater strength message contained agenda discussion commitment asked government allowed given therefore vote act gives force commission carrying commitment relating compensation damage caused recommended vaccinations know compulsory vaccines provide compensation event damage recent measures imposed government extended audience persons subject vaccination obligation close 30 million exact figure including fifty persons engaged health system law enforcement education covered law providing compensation moment people obligation still excluded strong recommendation vaccination battle lega salvini group premier partito sardo d'azione carried since beginning vaccination campaign tabled amendment unfortunately never successful time also virtue decision constitutional court rest parliamentary groups joined initiative seen wrote leader signature agenda resulting amendment 1.4 fair say also amendments majority opposition forces mr malan said strong convergence therefore conditions approving amendment already measure consideration unfortunately due lack technicians ministry economics finance accounting yet quite understood possible improve coverage good time let 's refer next useful measure government take next week clear commitment government highest level therefore believe agenda good success issue resolved next week even possible conversion decree law question could take place house deputies seven days time therefore shortest route allows us solve problem attended many citizens government 's commitment clear hope confirmed justice done damaged vaccine strongly suggested recommended state

#ZaffiniFrancesco,Minister the subject of the question is the fourth dose of the vaccine It is as you know a controversial issue on which the scientific community 's discordant opinions insist among which it would seem that those who attribute to the fourth dose do not have any effect especially with regard to the latest Omicron and Omicron 2 variants Finally today with statements even quite clear Professor Caruso president of the Italian Society of Virology says that at this time making a fourth dose of anti-Covid 19 vaccine with drugs aged at least two years and aimed at countering a viral strain that is no longer present in the world is an absurd thing from the theoretical point of view Professor Caruso also wonders whether this is linked to a time of difficulty in the pharmaceutical industry that is not to provide us with a second generation vaccine or in a more bad way if we have to imagine that there are deposits to empty Minister it is legitimate to suspect that there are deposits to be emptied since a few minutes ago I extracted from the European Commission 's website confirmation of the fact that 4.2 billion doses of vaccine have been purchased from a European population that does not reach half a billion people There are approximately 10 doses of vaccine of the old vaccine of course per head which you do not understand well what they should be used for Today an important newspaper Il Fatto writes that the fourth dose is used to dispose of Pfizer 's stocks Beyond what may be the controversial world of the scientific community and I do not envy it Minister in having to interpret absolutely conflicting messages it must be said that this branch of Parliament approved an agenda in the Government 's favour on 7 January which called for the need to carry out an antibody screening before proceeding to the fourth dose then the second booster dose in order to assess whether the person to whom it is inoculated already has an antibody immunizing heritage If this general and overall screening had difficulties especially in terms of time and costs it would be absolutely important Minister to revise the strategy ensuring at least that this individual analysis is carried out at the request of the subject especially for those categories which should be subjected to vaccination obligation PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Health Mr Hope has the right to reply to the question which has just been put for three minutes,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,16.886518,-22.839561,1,minister subject question fourth dose vaccine know controversial issue scientific community 's discordant opinions insist among would seem attribute fourth dose effect especially regard latest omicron omicron 2 variants finally today statements even quite clear professor caruso president italian society virology says time making fourth dose anti-covid 19 vaccine drugs aged least two years aimed countering viral strain longer present world absurd thing theoretical point view professor caruso also wonders whether linked time difficulty pharmaceutical industry provide us second generation vaccine bad way imagine deposits empty minister legitimate suspect deposits emptied since minutes ago extracted european commission 's website confirmation fact 4.2 billion doses vaccine purchased european population reach half billion people approximately 10 doses vaccine old vaccine course per head understand well used today important newspaper il fatto writes fourth dose used dispose pfizer 's stocks beyond may controversial world scientific community envy minister interpret absolutely conflicting messages must said branch parliament approved agenda government 's favour 7 january called need carry antibody screening proceeding fourth dose second booster dose order assess whether person inoculated already antibody immunizing heritage general overall screening difficulties especially terms time costs would absolutely important minister revise strategy ensuring least individual analysis carried request subject especially categories subjected vaccination obligation president debate minister health mr hope right reply question put three minutes

#ZaffiniFrancesco,Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President today is an important occasion the fiftieth vote of confidence that the Italian Parliament is holding with this Executive The government of the best or supposedly such that in reality is the Government of the Renitent at least to the parliamentary debate proposes to us the fiftieth vote of confidence on an absolutely important and substantial subject what is the one that faces the so called decree law reopenings We have always in the course of the pandemic for countless times put our attention to the need to review health standards and to put an end to restrictive measures Years have passed since the beginning of the pandemic but the posture as President Draghi would say is always the same This measure continues to provide restrictive measures and neglects important health measures that are now absolutely obvious to everyone except the Government With regard to restrictive measures for example Article 1 it is even expected that civil protection orders may be issued again until 31 December at the reasoned request of the competent administrative authorities communicated to the Chambers and therefore without the knowledge of the institutions This is really serious and paradoxical because it is now clear that we have full ears of these measures Another argument is the one correctly illustrated with narrow teeth my colleague Romeo I regret it and I hope that his teeth will not suffer even if continuing to have to do interventions with tight teeth puts the structure of his teeth at risk compared to the blessed masks If in fact Mr President of the 12th The Commission the head of the Ministry 's prevention says that it has no scientific evidence capable of supporting the need for the use of masks then the answer to my colleague Romeo I do it it is clear that we want to continue with the media gag and also the symbolic gag because the world moves on symbols and the mask begins to become a symbol There are still restrictive measures to the detriment of health care which you know now ladies and gentlemen these are the ones we have repeated a thousand times namely home therapies territorial health and the Covid protocol for hospitals as well Even today there is no specific Covid protocol for hospital admissions and I do not say for home therapies where still exists the famous Tachipirina protocol and vigilant expectation We need the new vaccine My colleague Mr Sileri I appreciate your presence and your constancy and I also hope that your teeth will remain but I think it has become paradoxical that even in the scientific community everyone wonders about the need for a new vaccine and the inopportunity to call to the fourth dose since in October we will probably be forced to call to the fifth dose with the new vaccine I hope that the new vaccine will take account of the variations Someone should also explain to us poor Members of Parliament to the knowledge of which the measures continue to be adopted what the ten vaccines per head that Europe has bought from the large producers who make exorbitant budgets have been used for Monitoring and prophylaxis capacity should be increased Compared to this point the opinion of the 12th The Commission has a note which I appreciated although it is obviously not enough to get us to vote on that opinion Measures on school should be taken Rather than forcing the kids to gag fortunately at least over six years for hours and hours with absolutely minimal expense compared to what you have made for the many investments in the school I can think of one that I leave to you to guess because I do n't want to persevere and continue to talk about the usual affair of wheelchairs you should provide for the mechanical ventilation of the classrooms as the virus in September and October will recover along with that flu Ventilation has been shown to reduce 80 of the transmissibility which the vaccine cannot guarantee In fact the vaccine has been able to guarantee fewer admissions to intensive care and deaths probably even if we talk about this but it has not covered compared to the communicability of the virus Providing ventilation of classrooms which are still chicken classes would be absolutely important to reduce the transmissibility by more than 80 as has been shown What is the record of the reopenings I have heard the speeches of my fellow Members and today we are ready to take stock of the dramatic period that Italy has gone through Well budgets are soon made my colleague Mr Sileri we have 20 million health benefits suspended a huge amount of healthcare denied one in three Italians has been waiting for a health benefit and has probably been waiting for it for months if not for years The regions are exhausted Colleagues do you know how much the deficit of the Regions compared to the Covid expenditures anticipated by them with their own budgets We are talking about 8.5 billion euros so much the amount advanced by the Regions compared to Covid expenses only in a small part reimbursed by the State Covid funding amounts to about 5 billion in total over the two years the expenditure of the Regions amounts to more than 13 billion in the same period of time Lombardy for example spent 1.7 billion and 1.077 billion in 2022 in 2021 Lazio spent 870 million in 2021 and 840 million in 2022 which are 80 expenditure on the regional budget Do you understand what it means with respect to suspended benefits and waiting lists if the Regions are exhausted from the financial point of view because the state has done ATMs with regional budgets and does not commit to return the anticipated expenses with the Covid What awaits us is dramatic compared to this picture The most dramatic budget of this period however ladies and gentlemen and I would like to say to my colleague Mr Boldrini that the direction of the road is absolutely not this that the government has seen after the whole pandemic period is the greatest reduction in gross domestic product compared to the Western economies as a result of the restrictive measures taken which also prevent the recovery of pre-Covid levels Today Il Sole 24 Ore headlines Italy at the last place for the recovery of pre-Covid levels of GDP But above all truly dramatic it is that we still record the greatest number of deaths today compared to the Covid epidemic On this you can discern what you want you can say everything and more but all the magazines and the scientific community accredit Italy to the top of the rankings for deaths from Covid Stop then saying that the direction of march is the right one because if this is the direction of march obviously take Italy to beat I shall conclude Mr President Thank you very much and I would like to address my colleagues in the majority including the rapporteurs why has Italy remained the last European nation not to set up a Commission of Inquiry For what reason What are you afraid of Italy has had committees of inquiry in all the legislatures except this and the previous one why do you not want to set up a church commission that goes to see what happened in our national health

fact we had the Christmas decree then the New Year 's decree and then the Epiphany decree This is to say in short that wrong is human but persevering is diabolical The government continues in its contradictions and I give you some examples because I believe that it should be clear to the Italians the direction that is being taken The first contradiction concerns the fact that the government has focused everything exclusively on vaccines I would like to point out that I myself have taken the third dose and in the Brothers of Italy Group we are all convinced that the vaccine is a useful and necessary tool However we believe that it cannot and should not be the only instrument And I 'm not saying that I remember President Draghi when in the press conference of 22 July introducing the obligation of the green pass he said that it delivered to the Italians safe places where it was not possible to get infected I do not have to remind the House of the number of cases of infection and the number of deaths The government therefore contradicts itself Seeing every night the war bulletin in which the numbers of tampons contagions and deaths are reported contradicts the government 's policies on the vaccine To see that we have reached almost 250,000 contagions and that the dead unfortunately we speak not of numbers but of people are about 300 per day does not calm the Italians A government that 's focused on the vaccine and green pass should n't contradict itself The other contradiction that I would like to make very clear is the lack of sense of informed consent I believe that the latter applied to a health treatment imposed for all people of common sense and not ideological is absolutely unreasonable All those who went to vaccination had in front of them the form bearing the words I agree and authorize the administration of the vaccine This is the formula found at the bottom of the form when you go to make the vaccine However it is clear that this is an informed consent present in the forms that also gives the possibility to refuse the administration of the vaccine The theme which has already emerged and which Brothers of Italy have noted for a long time clearly is that today the subject of informed consent for the new measures adopted by the Government is more strongly imposed I am referring here to the application of the vaccination obligation in the measure we are examining for certain categories and in the Epiphany measure for all over fifty Therefore the question that the Assembly and the representatives of the Government should ask themselves and that all non-ideological people but of common sense are asked is whether it is legitimate even today to ask for the consent of those legally obliged to make the vaccine In our opinion it is not because informed consent even according to a recent decision of the Constitutional Court is envisaged in order to guarantee the freedom of all citizens thus respecting the second paragraph of Article 32 of our Constitution What interests us most is that this not only does not concern respect for freedoms but also has an effect on the imputation of responsibilities and that is what the Brothers of Italy Group has always asked for If the government I do not go into the matter if it has done well or has done wrong has decided for the obligatory vaccine precisely to be transparent and to convey confidence to the citizens it should take all the responsibility and not only for the compensation to those citizens I hope very few that they should have adverse reactions to the vaccine but also for compensation damages In fact I remember for example that if informed consent is incomplete and perhaps it is not said so based on incorrect scientific assumptions there is also the possibility of compensation for damages Therefore the government should note that the scenario has completely changed since the vaccine became mandatory There is therefore a vaccination obligation and in this case mandatory consent of the person concerned for this reason we say that there is a contradiction in terms The government not only has to put an immediate hand to informed consent but must put the funds which we have not found to pay those very few we hope adverse reactions to the vaccine I also say to you that there is no green passes which as the data show have had no effect on the infection I remember that just before the Christmas holidays the government filled its mouth saying that it was the best of all European governments that in Europe there were so many cases and that Italy was absolutely a model Colleagues today you are denied and perhaps someone should also reflect on what has been said about British Prime Minister Boris Johnson You all criticized him saying it was a disaster But if we look at Britain 's figures today and above all the number of deaths perhaps our government which has taken this direction should ask itself a few questions Then there is one more element if we are all convinced that the vaccine is useful and we still have to convince the many over fifty that they are not vaccinated what better than to say that the government assumes responsibility and therefore if there are adverse reactions the government has made funds available to pay compensation Once again the Brothers of Italy Group makes its request on this point which is crucial to convince those Italians that they have not yet convinced themselves also for the succession of decree laws and for the communication that is made also by science that critics We heard the WHO representative who said that we certainly cannot imagine moving forward with the boosters every three or four months Colleagues take note of this the responsibilities must be clearly shown to the citizens and there is no better way to convince the Italians to vaccinate than what the Brothers of Italy has always proposed",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#BagnaiAlberto,Mr President Minister the European legislator lays down a principle of common sense at the very least one knows about a drug how much less clinical evidence is available the greater the cure must be to monitor possible adverse reactions It is called additional monitoring was introduced into European legislation in 2010 and has been regulated in Italy since 2015 Additional monitoring requires two quite obvious things firstly it is recommended that healthcare professionals report any suspected adverse reactions secondly pharmaceutical companies should clearly describe in the leaflets how healthcare professionals and patients can report side effects It is a pity not to take the opportunity when the European legislator regulates himself according to common sense we have missed this opportunity in the case of Regulation 953 of 2021 which when introducing the green pass insists on the need not to make discriminatory use of it a blatantly careless indication in our country Unfortunately the rules on additional monitoring are also substantially disapplied during the pandemic in particular from the website of the European medicines agency EMA turns out that all Covid 19 vaccines currently used in Italy are subject to this monitoring for the simple reason that their marketing authorisation is conditional pursuant to Regulation No 507 of 2006 These were in fact medicines that met unsatisfied medical needs and therefore had to be introduced on the market but for which there was not yet complete data on safety and efficacy and therefore had to be monitored more carefully However the explanatory leaflets of the Covid 19 vaccines in Italy contravene the express provisions of the EMA not clearly reporting the adverse effects In addition there are no initiatives of the Italian Drug Agency Aifa aimed at raising awareness of health care personnel in relation to their obligations in the context of additional monitoring nor more generally whether and how the Aifa has undertaken the obligation to initiate additional monitoring programmes Aifa 's inertia in raising public awareness is remarkable Let me give you an example the last tweet in which the Agency mentions the pharmacovigilance portal www.vigidruga.it dates back to 23 November 2018 Throughout the pandemic the Aifa has basically kept quiet as if the reports were a nuisance to be discouraged and not a valuable and indispensable element to ensure the progress of science I guess negationism of side effects seemed like a good idea to someone Instead it is a bad idea and a serious error of communication because it arouses and legitimizes the most irrational fears That is why Minister we are interested in your clarification of additional monitoring,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,16.161171,-20.862839,1,mr president minister european legislator lays principle common sense least one knows drug much less clinical evidence available greater cure must monitor possible adverse reactions called additional monitoring introduced european legislation 2010 regulated italy since 2015 additional monitoring requires two quite obvious things firstly recommended healthcare professionals report suspected adverse reactions secondly pharmaceutical companies clearly describe leaflets healthcare professionals patients report side effects pity take opportunity european legislator regulates according common sense missed opportunity case regulation 953 2021 introducing green pass insists need make discriminatory use blatantly careless indication country unfortunately rules additional monitoring also substantially disapplied pandemic particular website european medicines agency ema turns covid 19 vaccines currently used italy subject monitoring simple reason marketing authorisation conditional pursuant regulation 507 2006 fact medicines met unsatisfied medical needs therefore introduced market yet complete data safety efficacy therefore monitored carefully however explanatory leaflets covid 19 vaccines italy contravene express provisions ema clearly reporting adverse effects addition initiatives italian drug agency aifa aimed raising awareness health care personnel relation obligations context additional monitoring generally whether aifa undertaken obligation initiate additional monitoring programmes aifa 's inertia raising public awareness remarkable let give example last tweet agency mentions pharmacovigilance portal www.vigidruga.it dates back 23 november 2018 throughout pandemic aifa basically kept quiet reports nuisance discouraged valuable indispensable element ensure progress science guess negationism side effects seemed like good idea someone instead bad idea serious error communication arouses legitimizes irrational fears minister interested clarification additional monitoring
#BagnaiAlberto,Mr Minister with an invisible smile because of the mask your answer does not go beyond all my perplexities honestly but that is not a problem I think the growing signs of dissatisfaction from the courtrooms are a little more problematic Let me give you an example the Council of Administrative Justice of the Sicilian Region in its ordinance n. 351 of 2022 expressly mentions the inadequacy of active and passive pharmacovigilance among the reasons for not manifesting unfoundedness of the question of constitutional legitimacy of Article 4 of Decree Law n. 44 of 2021 in the part where this provides for the vaccination obligation for health workers This is because according to the Constitutional Court the mandatory nature of a vaccine is only legitimate if among other things it is not expected to adversely affect the patient 's health without prejudice to the consequences which appear normal and therefore tolerable But in the absence of adequate pharmacovigilance this assessment is in re ipsa foreclosed I would like to spare you the list of judicial measures that are censoring the current pandemic fighting facility In particular the theme of the balance between the right to health and that to work is the subject of an increasing number of ordinances of the TAR which depreciate the logic of blackmailing underlying Decree Law No 44 of 2021 the same logic claimed yesterday with force and with the usual freshness by Minister D'Incà taking sides the courts in defense of Article 1 of the Constitution You see Minister the need to debate controversial issues is the incompressible essence of politics By suffocating the debate in the parliamentary classrooms you have only managed to move it to those of the courts where the government is increasingly succumbing because there unfortunately Minister it is not possible to pull right by putting the question of trust I therefore wish you every success in your efforts thanking you for it and for your willingness,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,16.012363,-21.514864,1,mr minister invisible smile mask answer go beyond perplexities honestly problem think growing signs dissatisfaction courtrooms little problematic let give example council administrative justice sicilian region ordinance n. 351 2022 expressly mentions inadequacy active passive pharmacovigilance among reasons manifesting unfoundedness question constitutional legitimacy article 4 decree law n. 44 2021 part provides vaccination obligation health workers according constitutional court mandatory nature vaccine legitimate among things expected adversely affect patient 's health without prejudice consequences appear normal therefore tolerable absence adequate pharmacovigilance assessment ipsa foreclosed would like spare list judicial measures censoring current pandemic fighting facility particular theme balance right health work subject increasing number ordinances tar depreciate logic blackmailing underlying decree law 44 2021 logic claimed yesterday force usual freshness minister d'incà taking sides courts defense article 1 constitution see minister need debate controversial issues incompressible essence politics suffocating debate parliamentary classrooms managed move courts government increasingly succumbing unfortunately minister possible pull right putting question trust therefore wish every success efforts thanking willingness
#PellegriniEmanuele,Mr President it would take a long time to be able to discuss these issues but I will try to condense in a few minutes some concepts that have emerged not only from the discussion of this measure in the Commission but also from the so called regulatory cluttering that Parliament 's classrooms see having at their examination measures relating to the management of the pandemic emergency We come with this measure to manage still the state of emergency and consequently the tools that are connected to it therefore the green pass and the vaccination regime We understand very well that government action had to be confronted with a serious situation And although the numbers are positive today in the sense that the curve seems to be actually decreasing and we are going towards a resolution of what are the pandemic problems but we must not lower our guard My speech focuses more on the appeal of government action to our employers towards our citizens who very often do not understand the goodness of the rules that we go to approve when they are obviously good I quote the example of an Italian citizen who just these days has found herself accessing a public office and has seen herself put at the door simply because the municipal administration to which he addressed did not even want to look at the documentation of vaccination exemption This is a problem that has recently been solved having arrived yesterday the green pass through a code that replaces the Green Pass Great but why did n't you get there sooner This is what our Group our Members of Parliament is trying to bring to the attention of the Government an attention which must be paid at times when amendments are proposed which are not biased or simply aimed at gaining electoral consensus as others may think On the contrary we try to listen to the citizens For example the woman mentioned who is Italian and therefore our employer could not withdraw the identity card because someone within the government team evidently did not want to pay adequate attention We are aware because we are convinced of the Government that this attention will come back to us and that therefore this type of problem can also be solved We also hope that some distortions such as those within the world of sport can be resolved I have tabled amendments with my group as have other groups on the capacity of stadiums and which is particularly important to me the possibility of having sports practice even for those under 12 years of age who have been vaccinated so that they have chosen to vaccinate but that during the fifteen days of the super green pass they have not been able to access sports activities I have been told that in the Commission this amendment has not been substantially transposed by everyone The reflection behind the amendment clearly responds to common sense if a boy has decided with the consent of his parents of course to vaccinate why not allow him to carry out sports activity If we go to say at all our meetings that sport does well that it helps health and accompanies us towards a recovery not only psychological but also physical why not also give these kids the opportunity to exercise legitimately and in the full capacity of their sports intended as personal social and sports promotion These are the attentions we ask the government These are the attentions that we must take forward regardless of whether or not we are in favour of the vaccine These are matters that I sincerely do n't care about I am interested in the fact that citizens can live peacefully surely and fully their status as citizens This is a reminder to the Government I do it myself and I believe that it can be done as a parliamentary House I really ask that this attention be taken by the Undersecretary to the relevant ministries and in particular to Minister Hope so that he can understand that certain proposals are not propaganda and political but simply proposals of common sense,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,15.286769,-20.08771,1,mr president would take long time able discuss issues try condense minutes concepts emerged discussion measure

#CantuMariaCristina,Mr President I take advantage apparently out of the question to express my bitterness for losing the opportunity first in the budget law and now in the context of the conversion of the unified measure with the Government 's amendment for not being able to take care of those who cared recognizing at least a refreshment to the families of doctors who especially during the first part of the pandemic when they lacked everything from the pandemic plan to the personal protective devices and little was known of how to deal with the virus with a spirit of self denial have tried to limit sometimes at the expense of their own life the pandemic effects for their patients I am very sorry that the sub- amendment although it was shared by all the Groups including and I thank you for that opposition for unknown reasons has been downgraded to non-priority while in its time for example funds have been found for shelters that save wild animals a very meritorious issue but from my point of view of priority very much after that of the refreshment of those who saved human lives We have lost two battles but we cannot afford to lose the war even if we know that nothing will return to the affection of their families those who have lost their lives But in their memory we will not disregard anything indeed we will try to re-produce it in every place moving from words to deeds well before March 18 the first anniversary of the established National Day in memory of the victims of the coronary virus epidemic so as not to leave it meaningless because believe me sometimes the medical class is underestimated compared to what it actually does for the common good As we enter the evolutionary perspective of the measure under discussion it teaches us that we must be forward looking because unforeseen events especially in the health field are a variable to be taken into account even more than in other areas And we can no longer afford to chase the reality having to approach with method the prevention and recovery of delays in care to honour the truth already intolerable well before the pandemic in a framework of systemic vision of proactive prevention and of governance of individual and collective risks because otherwise we will face an announced hecatombe with incisive dispositions to make effective the predictive analysis and the surveillance systems indicated but still unimplemented In the same way we must act effectively with very persuasive mechanisms on the monitoring of resources controls and responsibility of the entire chain which up to now is not allowed to trace with the exception at least partial of the measures provided for in the decree support-b which makes us believe that our confidence to the Government although with some criticality of the way and even if it has gone a little long was and is well placed Do n't disappoint us with the refreshment of doctors we also make sense of the President 's words It is a decidedly challenging perspective in terms of order review to guarantee the effective implementation of mission 6 of the PNRR with an innovative government of health and new rules of engagement of the distributors including doctors of general medicine also regarding the proactive integration between hospital and territorial medicine going to reduce the incidence of the risks of pathologies not only infectious with an accredited network and contract of care continuity for levels of intensity and timeliness of care the Government on this despite the appreciable efforts should have a little more marked impact in evaluation and controls of appropriateness and security in a framework of full institutional responsibility The same should also apply to conscious adherence to vaccination prophylaxis because the increased confidence of citizens in the state should indirectly overcome many of the concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines as I will never stop pointing out we are among those who believe that we must convince not to force and one of the strongest arguments to convince those who hesitate and are opposed to the vaccine is that the State takes full responsibility for any adverse effects From our point of view a great step forward has been taken also with regard to the application impact of the measures provided for in the decree law in conversion with Article 20 of the decree- b since it has finally revealed the concept that an obligation cannot be imposed even in a surreptitious form without assuming the responsibility for the possible consequences from January 27 thanks to the thrust of the League all this is norm Acting in the prevention and promotion of the health of the person the family and the community through conscious adherence is therefore another battle that we must know how to fight and win together the way of our future by combining protection of health and fundamental freedoms according to ethics and

#CantuMariaCristina,Mr President I understand that there is war and that we must deal primarily with refugees and the devastating consequences on the economy but I would like to point out that there has already been war here an epidemic war with the effects that we all know And there are those who in this war fought for us and fell to give us the chance to return to normal I do n't want to think that they are selfish shopkeepers because it was proposed by the League to make sure that it is not recognized now without if and without but to the families of doctors who died in the first phase of the Covid a proper refreshment As far as we are concerned it is not important that we call it the Cantù amendment for me we can also call it the Belzebu amendment provided that we approve it In fact our bill no 1061 of February 2019 was inspired by the measures taken and adopted to overcome the shortage of doctors and the consequent reduction of waiting lists No one has made it a matter of primacy the important thing is to do and do well In the same way for the new rules of engagement of retailers including doctors of general medicine the so called DM 71 provides for a series of important measures already proposed in the bill n. 2153 for the reorganization of the emergency emergency pre-hospital and hospital of March last year Let the Ministry of Health take due account of the elaborations of the League for the strengthening of territorial care in turn integrated with the continuity of assistance that we have already proposed in our draft laws So for refreshment to the families of the deceased doctors provided it is approved now without further referrals and delays This brings us back to the House despite the contrary opinion in the Commission of Health Ministries and for equal opportunities and family at least as I have been told Show that it is not true in view of the promised confidence in the amendment fully replacing the measure under discussion We do n't need the cockard but we did n't think the government needed it either Call it whatever you want as long as you do without further postponement because just a year ago we agreed that the day of remembrance would be established and that the government would undertake to find the necessary funds to honor them dignifiedly in addition to providing measures for the remaining categories of health and social health workers directly involved and for those who have suffered major permanent impairments to the psychophysical integrity not subject to protection All this finalizing the necessary resources correctly and congruly since as we have had the opportunity to remark in every place such cannot be considered those allocated to date by the Government with the appreciable first step made in article 31 of Decree Law No. 17 of 2022 I would not like a superstructure to be created in order to recognise the measure which could absorb part of what is allocated which is already insufficient

#PirovanoDaisy,"PIROVANO L SP PSd Az Mr President on Amendment 2,500 7 there is a logical question We have made a law that requires children to wear FFP2 masks both on public transport and at school in case of contacts and whatever else but FFP2 for children does not exist We are simply asking that a table be made as has been established with the approval of another amendment in the Commission with the producers of masks so that thanks to the cross-cutting work of the Commission they can be consulted as they have asked for over and over again I remember among other things that we always asked them to produce masks when we were in emergency This table would be useful to find out if FFP2 can be good for children and how they should be made But if we ask manufacturers and importers to have a low price in pharmacies for FFP2 we cannot find in the pharmacies of masks that are not FFP2 sold to mothers and dads and that cost more than 75 cents and up to a few euros We cannot understand why there is no willingness to solve this problem two years after the beginning of the pandemic This amendment seemed to us to be a common sense amendment because it is known that FFP2 for children does not exist but there are only FFP2 small ones So we maintain this amendment and we are happy that the Italian producers who helped us in the emergency were finally involved when the masks were not there It 's probably something that should have been done years ago and not now",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,13.8885565,-25.338455,1,"pirovano l sp psd az mr president amendment 2,500 7 logical question made law requires children wear ffp2 masks public transport school case contacts whatever else ffp2 children exist simply asking table made established approval another amendment commission producers masks thanks cross-cutting work commission consulted asked remember among things always asked produce masks emergency table would useful find ffp2 good children made ask manufacturers importers low price pharmacies ffp2 cannot find pharmacies masks ffp2 sold mothers dads cost 75 cents euros cannot understand willingness solve problem two years beginning pandemic amendment seemed us common sense amendment known ffp2 children exist ffp2 small ones maintain amendment happy italian producers helped us emergency finally involved masks 's probably something done years ago"
#DoriaCarlo,DORIA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen in the wake of the constructive criticism drawn up today by our Parent Company and yesterday by my previous friend Bagnai and colleagues I am speaking in an explanation of vote on the conversion into law of the reopening decree- law in order to finally celebrate the end of the state of emergency It is not a controversy for me but to be honest in my dual capacity as a doctor and a Member of Parliament I would like to stress that today we are converting a decree law into law that I could call decoction because it bears within it a series of rules that have already expired To allow you to follow the logical link of my reasoning I will quote the most salient articles and you will allow me some comments By carefully reading the measure one might wonder whether today the state of emergency has really ceased and whether it has ceased for a real favorable evolution of the pandemic framework or only for enchantment of the legislator distracted by other more pressing emergencies But our Minister of Health and the President in Office of the Council are respectable men and would never produce a document attesting to the cessation of the state of emergency if that were not the case Yet reading the text carefully one might wonder if changing the order of factors the product does not change recalling the famous phrase of Tancredi in Gattopardo where if we want everything to remain as it is everything needs to change Based on the assumption that the state of emergency has ceased to date from 31 March 2022 Article 1 which I read directly provides that civil protection orders may be adopted at the reasoned request of the competent administrations with limited effectiveness until 31 December 2022 in order to adapt to the evolution of the state of the pandemic by Covid 19 the measures of contrast in the organizational operational and logistic field already enacted during the state of emergency With the end of the state of emergency which cannot be extended beyond two years the figure of the Commissioner also lapses In this regard I would like to thank General Son for the professionalism and dedication with which he has been able to carry out the assigned task from excellent soldier and expert of logistics He has given us a new course in the fight against the pandemic making us forget the tragic primrose and infamous wheelchairs But let us return to the text at some very smoky points Article 2 provides in paragraphs 1 to 8 for the establishment of a unit for the completion of the vaccination campaign and for the adoption of others which are not better specified measures to combat the pandemic The structure operates until 31 December 2022 replacing the Extraordinary Commissioner since the Director of the new unit is assigned the same old powers as the Extraordinary Commissioner It is also provided that from 1 January 2023 the Ministry of Health will be responsible for the active and passive functions and relationships which in turn will enjoy the same powers as the Special Commissioner providing for an ever better definition of the organizational structure of the Dicastery and the authorization to hire from 1 October 2022 a quota of dedicated personnel The Minister of Health as well as the President in Office of the Council are respectable men and we would therefore do them an unforgivable wrong if we advanced the doubt that this rule was intended to mitigate the prohibition in fact of an extension of the state of emergency not foreseen Even in paragraph 8 bis of Article 2 it has perhaps been exaggerated to foresee the administration at the pharmacies of both SARS CoV 2 vaccines and flu vaccines in adult subjects with burdens on the caregivers by pharmacists appropriately trained and trained for the purpose by the Higher Institute of Health As a doctor I must stress that vaccination is a medical act and as such should be carried out under the direct control of the health care provider in order to manage possible complications at the time of injection such as anafilactic shock or wandering seizures Without wishing to diminish the role of the pharmacist it might have been worth extending the audience of qualified subjects involving nurses in the first place but also dental practitioners or why not veterinary doctors since especially the latter already have considerable skills and skills in treating all mammals except our species Article 5 is of great interest to everyone and regulates the obligation to wear FFP2 masks on means of transport This obligation is extended to 15 June 2022 for the most common means of transport as the law says and is confirmed until 30 April 2022 then already expired and decoction for access to vehicles such as cable cars cable cars and chairlifts It is spontaneous to wonder what is meant by more common referring to public transport and how different types of transport differ from the subject of the norm In fact we do not know that the cable cars operate only during the winter period nor that the virus has the ability to discriminate between those who travel by bus or on a cable car But the Minister of Health and the President in Office of the Council who are respectable men would never have enacted a decree law without scientific bases but we find it difficult to find it in the Order of the Ministry of Health of 28 April 2022 So some questions arise spontaneously why is there no obligation for the mask throughout Europe Are Italians more realistic than the king Is scientific literature agreed on the real filtering effectiveness of the mask compared to the infinitesimal size of SARS CoV 2 virus Paragraph 1 of Article 5 confirms the obligation to wear the type FFP2 devices until 30 April 2022 therefore already expired also for the shows and sporting events that take place outdoors and until 15 June 2022 for the same events that take place indoors For a long time it has been documented how the possibility of infection in the open air is minimal therefore it is difficult to find a rational one at their use Equally irrational and not supported by scientific data is the obligation to use masks during the lesson time part of students and teachers of the first and second grade primary and secondary schools as indicated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 9 Applause goes to Matteo Salvini who on Monday launched an appeal to change this unnecessarily oppressive rule which infests on children and young people already strongly tested by the pandemic events which have compromised any form of socialization with the well known psychosocial repercussions that this has brought and still entails Article 6 paragraph 1 extends until 31 December 2022 the current measures regulating the temporary exits of guests from residential health and social health facilities allowed only to guests with the Covid 19 green certifications which can be obtained following vaccination certified healing or after a negative rapid antigen test carried out in the last 48 hours or a molecular test in the last seventy two Nothing has changed since the time when the state of emergency existed but the Minister of Health and the President of the Council are respectable men and would never have enacted a decree law to cease the state of emergency if this had not actually been concluded Despite this some doubt in the light of these articles still remains Article 7 a specifies the duration of validity of the green certificate following a vaccination cycle Here there is a real diatribe on the scientificity of the vaccination obligation as set out in Italy where there are thousands of cases attested to symptomatic reinfection even serious in subjects who had completed the vaccination cycle even with the third dose not to mention the so called novax which by choice and conviction did not want to undergo vaccination going to suffer the suspension from the work and its remuneration except to see today recognized their reasons by the regional administrative courts and obtaining the payment of emoluments and attorneys with obvious damage to the treasury as well as in contempt of the right to work sanctioned by the Constitution I have only mentioned a few of the articles in the re-opening decree law that we are about to convert into law to stimulate a certain critical spirit which has been appearing in this House for some time now Then in the eternal conflict between reason and feeling interest and uprightness it can be seen that sometimes although we can go to heaven in a carriage we choose to go to hell on foot I would therefore like to conclude the speech by stressing that despite the concerns raised the work of the Minister of Health and the President of the Council who are respectable people in the full awareness of being going through the dark times of a tragic global crisis the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione intends
