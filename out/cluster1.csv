Thank you very much
I will be very brief Mr President I just want to make it clear that Mrs Meloni is not a shipwreck I 'm saying it because as we call it to order here when we do n't get to the point
Madam President on the basis of Rule 72 in relation to Rule 71 for personal remarks made to me in the previous point by Mrs Vidal which discussed the working conditions of domestic workers
I 'm done with this Mr. President The road ahead
Higher minister
I am asking for the floor for article 72 in relation to 103 because he has just attributed to the VOX Parliamentary Group the commission of an offence under the Criminal Code which is the exercise of gender based violence and I would like to recall that those who have committed violence
Let me finish
To awaken sexual instincts without having developed the brain will analyze them and turn them into slaves of their psychophysical tendencies I could give you a lot of details but I do n't have time

I 've got a minute to talk
These steel hooks Minister not the propaganda of your government and that of your media and your transmission straps and the collection of palm trees that applaud you every time you say
I 'm done Madam President
Thank you Madam President Minister why do you refuse to apologize to the victims of terrorism after insulting them by accusing them of lying
Unworthy because it has preferred to become the servile shroud of Bildu 's interests And I tell you one thing Minister that 's the synthesis of your failure and your shame and therefore you only have one alternative ask forgiveness
Thank you Madam President Minister why have you deceived the victims of terrorism
Thank you Madam President Minister no rodeos yes or no Is the Government satisfied with the contributions made by its parliamentary partners
Thank you Madam President Minister what is the government going to do in the face of the social climate of rejection caused by its management
Yeah It 's over Mr. President that puts a price on everything including the memory and dignity of the victims of terrorism and justice a minister who is servile to terrorists knows the value of no one and has therefore conquered discredit and misery in their management and as such their condemnation cannot be other than their dismissal Thank you very much
By the way you can run now Thank you

In conclusion Mr President
With all due respect Madam President Minister good morning Why does it offend you to be told that you have bribed the class unions to become your personal platforms
In conclusion Mr President as declared by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 13 December 2018 Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party I suppose you are clear that if I were to wear a robe and be in a court of law right now my speech would have been very different
I hope you 'll be very clear Thank you
With all due respect Madam President Good morning Minister are you using class unions as your personal platforms
The good thing is to go up to the rostrum with the absolute freedom to think that this can be your last speech here I recommend it to you to come in here every day thinking that tomorrow I am no longer because the voters throw me out do not choose me or I have decided to go to my previous professional private life
I 'm done
Very good is n't it Independence plurality First of all Minister you 're a lawyer man It was on the agenda how are you talking about traps if it was on the agenda accepted by the whole House and the whole Bureau Do not cheat you are being recorded and you are a lawyer although it has already been shown that it is not extraordinarily good He 's not a good propagandist either You 're so predictable that even a fellow from the smallest of the communication agencies knows the speech you 're going to make I told you we won the bingo not the line we did the bingo twice There are nineteen times you have said far right if you add up thirty two disqualifications and without the Bureau telling you anything There she is come on Yeah yeah I told him I was going to laugh because he gave neither one argument nor one justification for independence Visits to Moncloa is that independence is that parliamentary control You say you read me Article 20 of the Constitution You follow the parliamentary sessions that go on what you are going to talk about because yesterday I was the one who spoke of Article 20.3 of the Constitution which speaks of parliamentary control Are the visits to the Moncloa parliamentary control Is it putting your hands on the board of directors and reinforcing it by royal decree not coming to this House parliamentary control That is not parliamentary control Mr. Minister of Ancient Propaganda You in your speech are so predictable that we know what you 're going to say You 've gone to the disqualification of the group By the way you said we 're 0.0 could you give me the data We are four million Spaniards who support 52 Members And you say we 're the ones with the lies Look there are now three or four deputies This is the importance that PP attaches to the control of Spanish Radiotelevision Three or four Members present here Sure If you 're willing to make a deal with yourselves If we are the only voice that tells you to stop getting your hands on what you say is independent Because you have the quail that I broke the box I repeat to say that it is independent But if you have summoned to Moncloa who is your candidate By the way the new provisional presidency for propaganda comes from one you always talk about compound surnames in my case the Del Real is from one place and the De Luna are from another place You on top of that do not even know where the socialist family names come from the socialist families are indeed of the Abolene rancio of the Abolene rancio socialist The new interim president comes from an Abolengo rancio with a service sheet from her partner high ranking PSOE the construction of a lot of prisons at the time of Felipe González We are talking about the person who dedicated himself to selling the land of the Spanish Radiotelevision entity the sale of Prado del Rey is the partner of Miguel Barroso You say we mess with private television but if you 're a public concession you 've given it to them Either they 're public concession or they 're private If you want to be private issue for example in digital only in digital But for that there is no courage because they really like to be in the mood to have a license that you the public funds that you give them through the campaigns and the funds that you receive from Spanish Television because Miguel Barroso and company and Roures and company are the ones who above do the programs that the professionals of the Spanish Radio Television house do not do Minister of Propaganda if you are going to be the Minister of Propaganda learn at least the subject which you do not know You can tell me twenty thirty or forty times I will add at the end of the session ultra ultra ultra that I say ista ista ista For these are their customs to sell the land to have their friends companions comrades brothers husbands and wives being the ones who sell and get into the coffer and end up on the boards of directors another case to finger or are the ones who make the bargain with the money of all the Spaniards Minister get your hands off Spanish Radiotelevision stop your propaganda act Because I do n't know if you 're doing propaganda to campaign for Don Pedro Sánchez who does n't know if he 's going to be a candidate but that 's where it was said to be you By the way I was delighted to see the very modern Mr Zaragoza approach you to give I understand a last minute advice to such a moderate minister Otherwise we would have gone to thirty or forty insults per minute which is Mr Zaragoza 's shooting ratio But well I was delighted to see him moreover I was delighted to see him sitting as a minister I 'm very fond of Mr. Zaragoza But this campaign I repeat smells like election campaign and I love this smell because it is a smell of decomposition of your government and of struggle for who will stay the PSOE 's mess and what remains of the PSOE after the next elections so you are taking control of each and every propaganda mechanism in this country own semi-pensioners semi-private non-citizens whatever you can They 're breaking the emergency glass to see how they can convince the Spaniards that this this this has to go on but they 're actually going to go home forever And leave the insults to another than to me Mr. Platero not to me Thank you very much
I 'm done not a little chiringuite without disassembling
Mr. President you claimed cause is cause is cause is causeti
Cause cause is cause caused the cause of cause is the cause of the evil caused This is what I am claiming in this very law In one of the most tragic and sinister moments of our history in a tired and painful Spain but still able to discern between good and evil so that this mobilization of the Spaniards is true moved sentimentally convinced intellectually converted intimately we recover the pulse of a living prosperous Spain in peace and harmony and let us end with this blow to the legality that Mr Pedro Sánchez patronises Thank you very much

I would also like to thank you Minister for your words show in addition to the figures you have given us that there is that emergency and that need which I represent to you When he tells me that you have been thinking about it for a few days now he only confirms the reason for our urgent question namely that you need in addition to thinking about it to decide to make concrete aid not only by sneaking up figures more or less correct but by giving refreshment to an essential sector not only for those companies I am talking about private railways but also and above all medium and long distance road transport but also for citizens The consequence would be a disservice on transport if it were to close which would result in citizens being able to take advantage of services that private individuals provide to help public services I am therefore waiting to be satisfied but it is a watchful expectation because we will continue to verify that beyond words the facts arrive exactly as we do for the system of tourism sports facilities food entertainment and other sectors that we are controlling You want not in words but in fact to try to help

Mr President Madam Minister with all due respect I regret to repeat my deep dissatisfaction because during my visit to one of the Tendopolis on 20 June last I was able to see the situation more than dramatic inhumane and complete abandonment of the camp which presents considerable problems as I also mentioned earlier related to health issues One thing is to have an ongoing project another thing is to fix these human beings at the moment I 'm sorry to say but the scenario I 've seen lately is not worthy of a civilized country like ours so you have to act

RAUTI FdI Mr. President I apologize but such is the noise that I can't even hear his words Mr President ladies and gentlemen today we have been talking about sport
RAUTI FdI Mr President today we have talked about sport highlighting its social and physical value There 's a piece of the world Afghanistan where women can't practice any kind of sport I am speaking today referring to the subject that we have just discussed because I have joined the relay of parliamentarians that was promoted by the Observatory on the Status of Afghan Women born in the Extraordinary Commission for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights of the Senate This Observatory has carried out many initiatives that I am not here to remember among them a relay started on January 1 aimed at a communication and awareness raising operation through social media and the press but also through the accessions of parliamentarians and their interventions in the Assembly To this end we take turns at the end of the session even in general chaos to recall this path and invite other colleagues from the Senate and the House to join the relay of freedom for Afghan women It is clear and well known increasingly known and clearer I would say that since last August since the Taliban regained power in Afghanistan we have reached zero year Mr President I would like to ask you a second more by wasting time at first to have the silence For Afghan women and girls the dark years have returned with the systematic violation of all fundamental rights the right to study to work to make politics and also to manifest At one stroke all the difficult achievements of Afghan women in every sector are erased In addition to this hunger and cold have also arrived So while we are rightly concerned about the tragedy of Ukraine we cannot forget the drama of women children girls and the Afghan people I call on other colleagues to join our relay

Mr President ladies and gentlemen the representative of the Government the Memory Travel Fund very briefly is the title of the bill that we are called upon to dismiss in this House today after the examination in the 7th Commission From the title the bill may appear or suggest something fascinating and romantic but in reality it intends to strengthen Law No 211 of 20 July 2000 with which the Day of Memory was established in memory of the extermination and persecution of the Jewish people and the Italian military and political deportees in the Nazi camps To understand and understand it better it is worth briefly retracing the stages that led to the establishment of a day dedicated to the memory of the shoah a Hebrew term by which the extermination of the Jews victims of the Nazi genocide is indicated identified on January 27 as the day of the liberation of the concentration camp in Auschwitz It is from 1960 with a renewal of school programs that we begin to embark on the path of the recovery of memory and the historiographical debates on subjects of deportation and shoah take on some importance also for the resonance aroused by important trials in Germany against the Nazi executioners and the success of audiences of fundamental literary testimonies on the shoah such as the books of Primo Levi and Anna Frank which become real classic beds and studied also in schools The ministerial decree of 4 November 1996 n. 682 dictated changes to the history programs in schools of every order and grade broadening the attention on the facts of the twentieth century and giving the start from that moment to a particular attention to the racial laws to the relations between fascism and deportation to the history of the concentration camps leading to the development of numerous projects that often end with travels in the places of memory and in the aforementioned fields From then on the use of testimony has become a fundamental element in the teaching of the shoah The encounter with the witness has always been fundamental because it creates a huge empathy and gives students the opportunity to touch history and to embark on a path of knowledge capable of affecting their lives in a lasting way trying to avoid the risk of emotion passing and remaining nothing of what has been heard and learned Finally in 2000 the institution of Memory Day with Law No. 211 of 2000 has encouraged more and more school initiatives the protagonists of which have often been the survivors with their stories of imprisonment Mr President I am sorry but there is a lot of confusion this is something I think everyone is interested in
Mr Saponara rapporteur While it is true that the direct listening of the witnesses who survived that hell is fundamental in order to move the consciences of the young it is equally true that with the passing of the years those same witnesses are less and less so the direct vision of the places becomes even more important in order to keep alive the memory of the facts From this last consideration came the need to offer students a greater opportunity to visit them because those places can speak they can tell the tragedy of those who have suffered enormous atrocities in them and of those who while surviving them are no longer there It is therefore the aim of the bill today in this House to make it easier for young people to reflect on the sad chapter of history The draft law consists of only one article modulated according to the indications of the opinion of the 5th Commission This article announces the above mentioned Law No 211 of 20 July 2000 with the establishment at the Ministry of Education of a fund with a budget of one million euros for each of the years 2022 2023 and 2024 to promote and encourage while respecting school autonomy the memory trips to Nazi concentration camps for students of the last two years of secondary schools of second degree in order to mature the civic consciousness of the new generations with respect to the extreme suffering suffered by the Jewish people during the Nazi persecution of the shoah It will therefore always be up to the Ministry of Education with its own decree to be adopted within ninety days of the entry into force of the law to define the modalities of use of the resources and to determine the type of financial expenses On the other hand the Ministry of Economic Affairs has the task with its own decree of making the necessary changes in the budget As rapporteur for the measure I presented an agenda to the Commission accepted by the Government with the invitation to assess the need to include in the implementing decree the increase if possible in the years of this fund and to ensure that at least 40 of these resources are allocated primarily to the organization of memory travel by secondary schools of second degree located in areas disadvantaged or characterized by the presence of students in a state of social distress and finally to provide forms of awareness to the organization of memory travels and other forms of deepening of the history of the shoah addressed to schools that have not organized such trips in the previous three years This in summary is the content of the bill Before concluding Mr President I would like to thank Mrs Daisy Pirovano who as soon as she signed the bill showed great sensitivity to this issue and of course the entire Lega Group who signed it I thank the President of the 7th Commission Senator Riccardo Nencini and all my fellow Commission senators who have supported and shared the bill and its process Finally I would like to thank the Undersecretary Barbara Floridia for his willingness to accompany us until the end of this process both in the Commission and today in this House where I hope that the House will vote unanimously

ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President in order to try to meet the need not to waste the time of the House and not to make the opposition angry we ask as the Lega Group if possible of course we must all agree to put this amendment aside momentarily and move on with others so as to give time to verify the possibility of the transformation on the agenda requested by Mr Toninelli

ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President we find these accusations against us quite unacceptable not least because the Democratic Party has stressed the need for reforms to be made by Parliament throughout the referendum campaign Well this is Parliament and not the government And Parliament with its secret vote is free to decide what it believes best with regard to the future in the field of justice only on this occasion so at least we have all understood what the real reason for our request is

THE PIETRA FdI Mr President I may have misunderstood but it seems to me that the rapporteur has given a negative opinion on Amendments Nos 1.42 and 1.43 whereas the Commission had received a favourable opinion Either I was wrong or you should understand the position I repeat on the file of amendments in the Commission I had written that the opinion was favourable PRESIDENT The debate is Amendment 1.41 was adopted in favour while amendment 1.43 was opposed THE PIETRA FdI That 's right ma'am Amendment 1.42 was also rejected by the rapporteur But the Commission had been given a favourable opinion

BAGNAI L SP PSd Az Mr President I turn myself in I do not believe in science Instead I think that the phrase I believe in science is the most eloquent testimony of the spiritual and cultural degradation that we all want to oppose here I presume It may be true that God died as Woody Allen ironically recalls but this is not a good reason to replace him with the CTS I do n't believe in science because my research work has been doubtful
BAGNAI L SP PSd Az I 'm the one who has to release the hemicycle as a senator Can I have three minutes to intervene Can I start over PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator Bagnai I was n't mad at you In fact I was trying to get her to talk quietly Go ahead Senator Bagnai BAGNAI L SP PSd Az Do n't worry my colleagues do n't bother me As they do n't consider me I do n't consider them I would like to make my point thank you Mr President PRESIDENT The debate is closed You 're welcome BAGNAI L SP PSd Az So I go back to saying that if I do n't believe in science it 's because my research work was exactly to doubt it of course by scientific method It is precisely by this method that I documented the effectiveness of vaccinations in my speech of 10 November 2021 referring to the general discussion on the extension of the Covid 19 pass To be precise since there were nine decrees on the pass the intervention was in Decree Law No 172 of 2021 Still in the same debate however I warned against the serious limitations that the reinforced pass showed limits that were already evident at the time because the scientific motivations had long been known It was in fact known at least since July that immunity from vaccine has a short duration and that therefore the vaccinees can become infected as well as they can spread the virus There have been many cases of outbreaks in protected environments such as hospital wards or RSA As a result a measure that gave the illusion unfortunately not the guarantee of finding oneself among non-polluting people could only explode the contagions and for this reason I did not vote for it The facts have conformed to logic The peak of the cases was reached on 14 January 2022 at 177.514 almost exactly the quintuplo of the previous maximum reached at 35.075 on 16 November 2020 My contribution to this debate is summed up in two sentences The first it is clear that the pass is a means that has failed with respect to its stated purpose that of limiting the contagions because it could not fail encouraging careless behavior The second is that it is appropriate to take note of this in order to avoid any doubt that lets it pass instead of being a means is an end I remember Amnesty International paying attention to our country and that the democracy index 2021 places us among the imperfect democracies under Botswana That is also why I hope that the end of the state of emergency will lead to the dissolution of the CTS a CTS that has often misadvised the Government risking undermining its authority and of course the abolition of the Covid 19 pass which in this context has no more reason to be unless its aim is to establish a system of social credits and a capitalism of control contrary to freedom
