#PabloSáezAlonsoMuñumer,Mr President ladies and gentlemen we are debating a proposal for a law amending two laws affecting the Court of Auditors Law 2/1982 and Law 7/1988 Interestingly after almost forty years in force of the first law and thirty five years in force of the second Junts per Catalunya now realize the need to reform both laws and argue as they indicate in the statement of reasons for the proposed law that the court maintains certain functions due to the pressures that existed from the employees and members of the Court of Accounts Francois a Court of Accounts whose origins date back to the Courts of Valladolid of 1351 where some real offices that are given the name of accountants already appear And they realize precisely when the Court of Auditors rejected the endorsements with which the Government of the Generality intended to face the payment of the 5.4 million euros that were destined for the international promotion of the independence referendum and the independence process of Catalonia Mention is made of the intention to bring the legal configuration of the Court of Auditors closer to the basic constitutional principles of the rule of law which are the division of public authorities and the subjection of their actions to judicial control Curious complaint comes from a political party that continuously demonstrates that it does not respect the Constitution that it does not respect court decisions and that it does not respect the independence of justice For the VOX Parliamentary Group three are the main points to analyze The first any reform must be aimed at promoting the independence and impartiality of the functioning of the Court of Auditors and that is to revise the criteria for appointing advisers I would like to mention in this respect the review carried out in 2015 by the European Court of Auditors and the Court of Auditors of Portugal In the report issued by the two bodies it was recommended that the procedures for the appointment of accounting officers be reviewed and in particular that objective criteria be defined and that conditions for access to the post be clarified in greater detail Pure common sense Those of us who have experience in auditing know that the requirement of independence is key within the framework of ethical principles and professional rules that are reflected both in the Audit Act and its regulations and in international auditing standards Second This proposal for a law is intended to transfer the instruction of the procedures for reinstatement by the scope of the training delegates who are officials to the directors of accounts It is undeniable that in view of the procedure for appointing advisers this proposal does not strengthen the necessary independence in education and is a failure to achieve efficiency The professionalisation of the staff of the Court of Auditors must be strengthened staff who according to the Court of Auditors report had a high degree of commitment and technical competence appropriate to their main functions Third It introduces the possibility of delegating to the autonomous supervisory bodies the instruction of the jurisdictional procedures for the prosecution of the accounting liability of those in charge of managing the flow or public effects In VOX we believe that what needs to be done with the external control bodies of the Autonomous Communities is to abolish them and that the work should be carried out by the Court of Auditors Because it is common sense to realise that centralisation of control bodies eliminates duplication facilitates efficiency contributes to impartiality saves costs and fosters unity of approach We are talking about duplication and costs ladies and gentlemen The autonomous state has led to the creation of twelve external control bodies apart from the Court of Auditors which cost the Spanish around 79 million euros a year with budgets ranging from 12.9 million euros of the Union of Accounts of Catalonia by the way the most expensive to 3.2 million Navarra to the 5.1 million euros that the Council of Accounts of Castile and León costs We speak of independence and impartiality requirements that are not reinforced when bodies appointed by the autonomous community itself control matters of the same community We are talking about efficiency and unity of approach characteristics that do not currently occur within the framework of the proliferation of external control bodies Rather the opposite lack of unity of approach is what the Court of Auditors itself stated in its report on the autonomous public sector of the year 2018 talking about the normative inequality between the territories regarding the deadlines for accountability to the court and the supervisory bodies And lack of efficiency which is evident when you turn your back on the best practices of the market And it is that the best audit practices and I have been able to verify it in my twenty nine years of professional experience is that large companies have centralized their internal audit departments and internal enforcement It is truly inconceivable that we should not learn from best practices even more so given that we are talking about the control of public funds I conclude by recalling that seeking impartiality is common sense that seeking efficiency and professionalism is common sense that avoiding politicization is common sense that avoiding duplication is common sense and that VOX is pure common sense Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,36.334618,10.758288,18,mr

#PatriciaRuedaPerelló,"Good morning The Minister has concluded her speech by thanking the parliamentary groups for their support of these budgets Do you know you 're thanking flotters and thugs These budgets show the essence of this government these budgets show the essence of Sánchez a Sánchez who negotiates with the enemies of Spain who lied to his voters saying that he will not deal with the ETA heirs and today we see how he kneels before them He was not enough prisoners by budget now he surrenders to the heirs of terrorism by expelling the Civil Guard from Navarre We wish to express our appreciation and appreciation for the success of the Benemerita in its fight against the terrorist band ETA A Sanchez who said he wo n't deal with Podemos and there he goes conjured with the extreme left harmful who has brought to this House laws that violate the safety of children and women by reducing penalties to rapists This Government releases sexual predators and punishes those who pray in front of abortion centres Is this the government that defends women No this is n't This is the government of ruin sedition tradition lies and propaganda and you are complicit in voting yes Therefore from VOX infinite distance with this government infinite distance with those who attack our nation infinite distance against waste who end up paying the Spaniards through taxes those to which they force to tighten their belt The welfare state It is the welfare of the politicians of the unions of Sánchez 's friends placed in the Moncloa It is the most lycated government in the history of democracy with its chiringuitos and ideological delusions This is the government against people who only think of power and benefit the enemies of Spain and that is why we must throw them out and that is why elections are urgent Minister Sánchez assigned him a portfolio that represents key activities for Spain because they generate employment and wealth they represent a development opportunity for rural Spain for our young and not so young for Spain as a country brand and we have missed that opportunity You minister recognize that you have a sweet sour taste for the overall result of the PERTE of the Electric and Connected Vehicle a PART that excludes part of the value chain forgetting that the automotive industry is each of the SMEs each of the autonomous ones that watch over this industry And the funds do not arrive today it has appointed the approved LOSS which are the same as a year later they have not yet arrived Minister she has not achieved successful results for businesses and the self employed of a strategic industry It has abandoned them to their fate as it has abandoned the textile and clothing industry the trash the naval industry the metal industry in short the whole industry as it has abandoned trade and tourism Spain has lost an opportunity in one of the sectors that has suffered most from the consequences not only of the pandemic and Putin as they always say but of its policies and its unconstitutional state of alarm declared as such thanks to the resources submitted by VOX It was a state of unconstitutional alarm which curtailed rights and freedoms and banned them from working and imposed restrictions on them and so many have stayed on the road and others are now trying to survive suffering from over indebtedness and do not know how they are going to pay ICO credits or how they are going to deal with the rise in the bill for gas light fuels and commodities because this affects industrial plants hoteliers hoteliers small businesses Spanish families and all those who are afraid to turn on the light switch Minister every day small businesses close in the neighbourhoods more than 11,000 micro-enterprises have disappeared You have spoken of an unprecedented volume of resources and it turns out that the sector has expressed its absolute disappointment and indignation to you The Tourism Bureau expressed the Government 's contempt for tourism Minister seeing the bad figures and the disappointment of the sector do you believe that the work you have done supports you to be the candidate for mayor of Madrid It is a pity that we have the best candidate Javier Ortega to defend the interests of the Madridns against the PSOE which with its climate dictatorship wants to remove cars of more than ten years old from circulation and prohibit access to the center of the cities Where will the Spaniards get money to buy a new car if they can't get to the end of the month Minister the climate fanaticism of the Ministry for the Ecological Transition has been imposed on the interests of the ministry you represent We have lost competitiveness as China gets rich and jobs are destroyed He talked about competitiveness and there are items that have not even been implemented The budgets of the recovery path are the budgets of ruin But I will tell you what these budgets should be they should be on a zero basis to eliminate unnecessary spending and with policies that put families self employed people and businesses at the centre We know how to do it because we 're doing it in Castile and Lion In a hundred days the figures support it yes reduction in unemployment aid to conciliation to self employed people to businesses effective measures to prevent fires protection of farmers more industry more employment tax cuts cuts to trade unions and employers and inefficient political spending VOX promised it in campaign VOX fulfills And we will keep the following promise to do everything possible to throw them out to bring down the government of treason and ruin which opens prisons to pederasts and rapists terrorists and coups corrupt politicians with the passive gaze of the People 's Party It is time to push

#RocíoDeMeerMéndez,Thank you Mr. President The Spaniards have been afraid for a long time and it seems to you too long that you do n't care To all of you because this is not a new topic 2010 ten lives truncated by Latin bands 2012 arrested fifteen members of Latin bands accused of theft and injuries 2016 the revenge for the murder of a Trinitarian in Sol plans on the environment 2017 the new splendor of Latin bands more murders and more detainees 2018 detained twenty members of Latin bands for the death of a young man at the festivals of San Agustín de Guadalix Holders of 2010 2012 2016 2017 2018 You have to have the nerve to think that the Spaniards are going to swallow that this is not your fault ladies and gentlemen of the PP You have governed different administrations all these years and instead of accusing the Spaniards who warned of the problem of racists xenophobics or conspirators you had an obligation to solve the problem And if you do n't know how to improve living and living in neighbourhoods as you have already shown you have to give way to others who will Are you going to talk about the insecurity of the miners Curious that now they talk about the Latin bands because now you see the headlines again and yet do n't talk about the minas Does it have anything to do with you bringing them in and keeping them Ladies and gentlemen any problem has its origin and as Chesterton said it is not that they cannot see the solution it is that they cannot see the problem it is that they are unable to diagnose the problem well Because one of the fundamental origins of the insecurity of the ghettos non-zones and fear are the open borders You do n't say that because it 's the age of the politically correct because it 's wrong seen because you can't say certain things even if they 're true because of a possible media lynching The problem is that VOX gives us exactly the same media lynching and we will tell the truth always and at any price Ladies and gentlemen any serious criminologist investigates the cultural factor of certain crimes and does so in honor of the truth And the cultural element of origin is undeniable for several reasons Firstly as a statistical reality in many types of crime Secondly non-zones cultural impositions war in the ghettos and neighbourhoods ethnic wars are a reality in many neighbourhoods Thirdly there are new types of crime that did not exist in societies such as ours such as the ablation of clitoris forced marriages machete conflicts Mrs Fanjul the problem is not that machetes are sold very easily in Spain that is not the problem That is misdiagnosing a problem and also knowingly There are countries that are failed states that already work with the eye for eye tooth for tooth or have worked like this always with the law of the strongest There are countries with very high crime rates countries where life has very little value and there are countries in which the religious component like Saudi Arabia generates that we can execute and that they are prisoners of death for example those who deny a particular religion Ladies and gentlemen putting massively different cultures in order to create a possible model of multicultural society is a sham In addition it is a very fat thyme with consequences suffered by humble Spaniards The multicultural experiment in their roles in their heads is very nice In their heads it may be to eat basmati rice or soy milk but for the reality of the Spaniards for the humble neighborhoods it is criminality They 're machetes they 're herd rapes they 're forced marriages and clitoris ablation Ladies and gentlemen we will deceive the Spanish if we say that this problem has an easy solution Ladies and gentlemen of the PP twenty years of free bar paper and open borders have very difficult consequences to reverse It is you who have turned nationality into a process and devalued its value Ladies and gentlemen nationality is not a role We are attacked when we say so but nationality is a reality of belonging and it is clear that that role that process that that DNI has to resemble this reality as much as possible You 're shocked when we say that the homeland is not a contract Colleagues like Rufian say the homeland is the keys to their home For Podemos it is public health I do n't know if they consider private health users Spanish as the former vice president Carmen Calvo but the truth is that the nation is deeply uncomfortable for you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,34.204468,17.05614,18,thank mr. president spaniards afraid long time seems long n't

#RocíoDeMeerMéndez,Thank you Mr. President The truth is this makes me think that xenophobia is fear of the other is n't it Here really what there is is an atrocious fear of thinking differently which you manifest in each of your interventions But we 're going to keep thinking differently and unfortunately you 're going to have to keep listening to us for a long time I know it 's hard for you to understand but we are very proud of our nation very proud of our history very proud of our families and very proud of our culture and that no progress has been made to make us ashamed of it Let 's keep proclaiming the truth let 's shield the one who shields the truth I was also a little concerned about one of the interventions Mrs de Esquerra's which said that 19 March was going to be a sort of international coven against racism Well March 19th for VOX it will continue to be St. Joseph's Day and Father 's Day and no progressive religion will end our millennial culture You want us to believe that some people are fleeing the war and that we have a duty to welcome ourselves as a multicultural society and also to devote our public resources to taking advantage of them giving them shelter supporting them and respecting their customs And if you do n't like it you 're a racist and you 're a xenophobic which is what you always tell the Spaniards We are used to being told it gives us a little bit of the same but the problem is that they tell almost five million voters that they will probably have VOX It is not true what you tell them permanently crushing the Spanish with all their subsidized media It is not true that some come that is the first lie come en masse comes a mass immigration If we collect only the last twenty years in 2000 foreigners living in Spain accounted for 2 of the total population and in 2021 they account for almost 12 of the population almost six million people and in addition their own media say they want to increase it until 2050 in another seven million inhabitants I mean there 's not a few coming Neither come as the former secretary of state of his party said raped women fleeing the war to begin with because what comes are men But what war is there in Morocco What war is there in Algeria What war is there in Mauritania What war is there in Senegal The issuing countries of most immigrants coming to this country are not at war There are a small number of refugees coming from countries at war but they are not the problem we have on the table And you permanently want to confuse the Spaniards with your Welcome headlines refuges If we convince everyone that raped women are coming who are fleeing the war who is going to be against this The problem is that they deliberately deceive the population to condition their opinions But there are more lies There are more lies because those who arrive profit from the mafias which are the big business of all this massive immigration that you want to bring for the economic benefit of Europe because it is sent to you by the big capitals I have told you on more than one occasion because it is the reality and moreover it has been acknowledged by Mr de Bildu in his intervention But there 's just another lie We do not have to respect their customs when they are contrary to ours We do n't have to respect female genital ablation We do not have to respect forced marriages which have already increased by 60 in Spain We do n't have to respect the law of the strongest We do not have to respect or resolve machete conflicts because we do not have to respect these customs Another lie is that you say that we have to devote our public resources to them but our public resources have to go first to the Spaniards who need them You do n't have to go to this huge host mass of immigrants when in Spain we have 40 000 homeless people and 30 youth unemployment when you turn up the light to the people 46 when the gasoline goes up when the shopping basket goes up Where there is poverty is among the Spaniards and that is what you do not want to solve or dedicate your resources to it And of course we are neither racist nor xenophobic because we characterize ourselves precisely because we love and want to preserve Spain the Spain we have received from our parents and we also have the right to do so We have the right to want to preserve it and to ensure that our streets are not battlefields We have the right that our daughter not be the 12 year old girl of Azuqueca raped in mass We have a right that our grandmother is not the 80 year old woman raped and stolen in Alicante We have the right that our grandmother is not the 90 year old woman raped in Figueres by another immigrant and we have the right that our brother is not the man of Murcia to whom he was amputated by a machete That 's what we 're entitled to And why do we bring you here today this non-law proposal Because we do n't think anywhere is it written that Spain has to resign Because nations and civilizations die and disappear and if there are a number of States that are pushing Spain Morocco Algeria Tunisia or Mauritania by bringing mass immigration and not accepting repatriations back we have to respond with our own sovereignty and we have to use all the tools of international law that are within our reach such as the draft articles of the Commission that recognize the possibility of demanding and carrying out self guard measures against States that are attacking your own sovereignty as is the case Spain must press internationally because it is good enough that Spain is the laughing stock of the world it is good enough that Spain is in Brussels not to demand its own and it is good enough that Spain has surrendered the southern border Because who sold the Canary Islands Which office did you sell Canaries in Who has decided that now the Canary Islands has to be a great concentration camp Who gave up Ceuta Who gave up Melilla In what closed office tell the Spaniards have you sold the southern border of Spain And finally I know that you hate our identity our symbols our flag our history and our hymns but I will end up with a piece of a legionary anthem Third Heroes as a tribute to the foreigners who come to Spain to love her to care for her to respect her and even sometimes to give their lives for her especially serving the Spanish Legion,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,33.762287,17.140503,18,thank mr. president truth makes think xenophobia fear n't really atrocious fear thinking differently manifest interventions 're going

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,Thank you President Minister you do n't serve your intentions The policies I have already told you are measured by the results and as you see most Spaniards of all conditions are outraged and very concerned about your negligent management at the head of the Ministry of Equality which costs us more than 500 million euros a year of our taxes so that you end up telling anyone who disagrees with your insanities that fosters the culture of rape when your law is the one that puts rapists on the street This should give you at least shame And if you have a little dignity left yes or yes resign,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,27.238117,14.743093,18,thank president minister n't serve intentions policies already told measured results see spaniards conditions outraged concerned negligent management head ministry equality costs us 500 million euros year taxes end telling anyone disagrees insanities fosters culture rape law one puts rapists street give least shame little dignity left yes yes resign

#InésMaríaCañizaresPacheco,After his statements we now understand that since Podemos systematically sees the investigation of recent sexual scandals with minors for from his words we extract that these aberrations do not in essence see them as a crime but accept them as something normal His social engineering based on a perverse ideology seeks to confuse the innocent presenting the darkest desires of the radical left as rights You victimize people on the pretext of protecting them but then abandon them in a society that dehumanizes the individual and humanizes the animal We hear the words of a minister who has lost the north and the papers who turns her personal problems into state issues and who legislates for trauma His ministry is the biggest attack on the equality of Spaniards the embodiment of discrimination and its policies against confrontation It is 525 million euros useless except for you your little friends friends and friends while thousands of Spanish families do not arrive at the end of the month Since VOX we have called for your reprimand and your cessation and we have complained against you for inciting a crime of child corruption Children are not mature enough to make certain decisions so they are children and their parents and the public authorities subsidiaryly are responsible for ensuring their protection and not for their corruption,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,29.251911,13.375356,18,statements understand since podemos systematically sees investigation recent sexual scandals minors words extract aberrations essence see crime accept something normal social engineering based perverse ideology seeks confuse innocent presenting darkest desires radical left rights victimize people pretext protecting abandon society dehumanizes individual humanizes animal hear words minister lost north papers turns personal problems state issues legislates trauma ministry biggest attack equality spaniards embodiment discrimination policies confrontation 525 million euros useless except little friends friends friends thousands spanish families arrive end month since vox called reprimand cessation complained inciting crime child corruption children mature enough make certain decisions children parents public authorities subsidiaryly responsible ensuring protection corruption
#PabloJuanCalvoListe,Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party your motion begins by regretting that the government 's handovers to remain in power in exchange for support and to bring its laws forward are growing We too regret it but I ask you are you not recognized in these statements We go with a little historical memory but not the law that they replicate where they rule because they do n't call them what they call us real memory Agreements with nationalist parties for the investiture or to support the government began in 1993 when Felipe González had to deal with CiU and PNV In 1996 Aznar closed the Covenant of the Majestic with Pujol and a long list of decisions and the PNV collected fruits of the walnut until the Pact of Lizarra Later Zapatero supported himself in Esquerra Republicana the Catalan separatists obtained the new statute which then fell down the Constitutional Court and in its second legislature resorted to the PNV just as Rajoy did in his last legislature In 2018 Sanchez designed the new divestitures for the coup and in 2019 he knew that his governance and his ability to legislate are reduced Hence from the beginning of the legislature he accepted the demands of the separatists including the unworthy table Transparency is abandoned they are seen in secret The objective of Esquerra is clear to break the constitutional order with the holding of a secessionist referendum seen with good eyes by four of the six ministers While the Spanish language continues to be attacked harassing children and families such as those of Canet de Mar failing to comply with the law on education and its use in the judicial sphere causing the escape of magistrates preparing pardons for convicted coupsmen or withdrawing the Spanish flag from a Generality room behind the table bringing Catalonia to ruin and creating a climate of confrontation violence and intimidation such as those suffered last Friday by my colleagues Juanjo Aizcorbe and Juan Carlos Segura as well as other Catalan parliamentarians at a conference at the University of Barcelona Thank you brave men In the interpellation Minister Bolaños was very dignified and tried to justify the legality of the table Look this table deals with the rights of the Spaniards who are non-negotiable which puts Sánchez out of the Constitution lacking democratic legitimacy to talk about amnesty self determination and referendum with coups You are a danger to Spain and to the Spanish With those who attack the equality of all Spaniards with those who seek to break the unity of the Spanish nation in VOX we never sit neither in equality nor in inequality we apply the law With separatism coup and terrorism we do not agree or sit down In his motion gentlemen of the People 's Party we miss the marketing that is the support received by the successors of those who kidnapped Ortega Lara murdered and attacked the relatives of my colleagues José Alcaraz ToniSalvá and Teresa López or several Members present here That is why our amendments are being tabled The PSOE has always met with ETA when it was killing and now it needs the support of its heirs Publish the minutes of

Kubati wants that is the direction of ETA ETA prisoners applaud Sánchez 's approach they say we no longer need buses The PSOE is paying the terrorist gang 's revolutionary tax for bringing it to power destroying institutions and trampling on the memory of all victims Behind Sánchez stands separatism and ETA ultimately the enemies of Spain lies as a political strategy moral and economic ruin trades

#PabloJuanCalvoListe,"Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen when a government deals with the heirs of ETA with the separatists and with the couplists the general budgets of the state bear unfailingly the mark and seal of all of them If they had to hide the government 's transfers to the enemies of Spain where would they do it Indeed many of them in the additional transitional derogatory and final provisions that occupy no less than 60 of the bill camouflaged in all kinds of consignments Some of these assignments are seen and others are not but they have all been negotiated in the shadow of budget support and will see the light very soon The government 's policy for what is not seen or not seen but which we all know is to disconnect it from the budgets and to make it appear that it is not an assignment If a year ago they were imprisoned for budgets this year they are again imprisoned for budgets Bildu believes he 's going to go unnoticed but the negotiated thing is to get out of jails to those who still serve sentences and reform Organic Law 7/2014 to reduce the penalties that come from those in French prisons The Moncloa 's excuse is that the reform is mentioned in the annual training plan for 2022 Bildu runs prison policy and we can't consent to it What everyone sees and does n't appear is the covert amnesty of budget thugs Sánchez denies what his partners recognize However everyone is satisfied Government PSOE Esquerra who says it is a great step forward and even Otegui says it is a positive news The case the sentence for sedition and embezzlement of the coup the means the elimination of the crime and the end support for the general budgets and in passing breaking the rule of law by disallowing the courts in a genuine fraud of law Sánchez was passing by but of course the Government has accepted the literal dictate of the reform demanded by Esquerra And it is that this Government on the one hand abuses the real decree law the urgent procedures and again the vetoes to the budgetary amendments that is except those of the PSOE without any legal economic justification as required by the Constitutional Court And on the other hand it imposes through final provisions the amendment to its wish of up to five laws with no direct relation to the income and expenditure table for the new fiscal year first the Government Act second the General Subsidies Act third the Law on Public Sector Contracts in the Field of Defence and Security indeed will this have something to do with the ignominious expulsion of the Civil Guard in the surveillance of defence delegations from 1 January fourth the Staff Regulations and fifth the Public Sector Contracts Act They are all clearly unconstitutional amendments as he also notes one more year the report of the House 's lawyers indicating that they will be able to contradict the doctrine of the Constitution by infringement of rights a warning which the Bureau once again despises while maintaining itself The PSOE tabled an amendment adding a transitional second bis provision allowing the municipalities to hide the IBI rises which are almost 99 of the cases that is until 31 July What a coincidence they 're leaving it for after the May election In the seventeenth additional provision the offer of judges and prosecutors shall not exceed two hundred places They include gender workshops Minister absent when the General Council indicates that there are a number of vacancies and that there are 342 members In Spain there are twelve judges per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe the average is eighteen six more judges This causes a slow and collapsed justice Is this guaranteed the right to effective judicial protection Minister also absent The only interest you all have in justice all of you is your control And now a classic so again in the ninth additional provision is subsidized to political parties They will have EUR 111.4 million for their operation for their security and for election expenses The departure of trade unions appears camouflaged in the Ministry of Labour carrying no less than 17 million euros almost twice as much as two years ago VOX 's proposal is to eliminate subsidies to trade unions employers and parties as they make them a fundamental way to ensure their livelihood as would happen with class unions which would have to close practically The proposal of all of you is to maintain them but Spanish taxes must support only what is important schools health centres dependency justice security and infrastructure At a time when prices rise and the penalties for sedition embezzlement and sexual assault fall do you know that the Spanish would decide Why do n't you ask them whether or not it will suppress aid to parties trade unions and employers Be brave Article 92 of the Constitution allows this Let the Spanish decide and let them decide now This week we 'll see how Sanchez makes specific crimes tailored to the perpetrators making a covert amnesty and facilitating the future commission of the crime which they announced they would do again And it is done by pacting with the enemies of Spain so that they support the budgets of ruin a lamentable display of submission and obedience in the Congress of Deputies That is why we have no choice but to tell you resign now leave and call general elections Thank

#SantiagoAbascalConde,It has proved to me surprising and exciting to see Mr Sánchez begin his intervention by asking for the withdrawal of one of the qualifications that I have used in this rostrum I have called him autocrat and has generated such indignation in the president that as I have few readings of philosophy and law as you know I have had to consult the dictionary of the Royal Academy which says that autocracy is the form of government in which the will of one person is the supreme law It turns out that you have changed the position of the Sahara without your Government without your party and without this Parliament I understand it bothers you but tell me what we call this Mr. Sanchez I occasionally read yesterday an article published yesterday it is among my few readings Mr Sánchez by a former judge of the Constitutional Court Mr Manuel Aragón appointed by you in the Constitutional Court which is entitled Presidential Parliamentarism in which he denounces the presidential drift of Pedro Sánchez What do we call the way in which you have acted in the Sahara and what we call the way in which you have conducted yourself during the epidemic passing over this Parliament and trampling on the Constitution itself according to rulings of the Constitutional Court You here call us many things and I am not going to appeal to the president to remove them from the Journal of Sessions We want you to record everything you say about us to record so that you will retract and to be ashamed of all of you You want it removed I of course do not wish to be removed I keep it and moreover I think we have justified why we say this about you You think it is the supreme law because you have sent a letter in which you say that Spain has a position and you are not Spain you are not even the President of Spain you are the President of the Government of Spain You are not the representative of the State You 're not the head of state You can't go around without consulting Parliament making announcements you do n't even know about the Council of Ministers I do n't have a Ph.D. in Philosophy it 's true Mr. Sanchez I 'm not like you who has a Ph.D. in Economics We already know that you are a great economist perhaps that 's why Europe 's worst data at the head of youth unemployment together with the countries with the worst inflation data with the worst unemployment data with the worst debt data Well you 're a great economist we all know that He 's come up here to say we spread bubbles I have quoted news from the newspapers one from the newspaper El Mundo in connection with the disappearance of the Philosophy Of course you say that we have extended a bubble but I have just taken a tweet from a gentleman who I believe is one of the government 's supporters he is usually here behind Mr. Javier Sánchez Serna who says The PSOE intends to deny what is a fact that philosophy does not have its own subject in ESO In The LOE ethics was mandatory in the fourth of the ESO In LOMLOU optional Now he 's gone Civic Values is not going to be a subject linked to the departments of Philosophy We know what it 's gonna be You confuse philosophy with ideology You confuse philosophy with ideological and political indoctrination with multiculturalism gender theory and all those things that you like so much and that you now care so much about Mr. Rufián because he tells you that you are not in what you have to be that you are not in the things of eating You have also reproached us for the fact that Algeria has suspended flights from Iberia and repatriations published today in El Confidencial you complain to El Confidencial which cites official sources from Algeria and to this I refer It 's okay for you here to explain but they do n't seem very convincing given the things you usually say here I was surprised to see that the President of the Government 's appearances have become a succession of attacks on VOX but I see it almost with satisfaction VOX is the enemy to beat No Mr Echenique who always listens from the corner we are not against science what happens is that you are against common sense I mean what can we not produce with coal but can we buy thermal energy from Morocco Are they from another planet Do they have another atmosphere As you know so much about science I 'd like you to explain it to us And no Mr. Rufián VOX has condemned Putin long before you and long before your coup partners who took advantage of Putin to attack our Constitution and our unity And what VOX has done in Madrid is something similar to what the President of the Government has done to distinguish between Putin and the Russian people for the help of the Russian people during the 11M by the way the date from which separatism and the left returned to power And no Mr. Rufián the Spaniards must not be filled with the refrigerator from the government what must be done is not to plunder it as you all do by spending the money of the Spaniards on their climatic multicultural or gender delusions of the silly genre You know they 're wrong Mr Sánchez asks what else has to happen in order for us to respond together Well I 'll answer it to you Look first of all that your partners are not the enemies of unity Secondly that you do not permanently demonize four million Spaniards and then complain that we do not take your phone Thirdly may you reply to what you are asked to whom you are loyal to what you owe because you have made decisions without the support of Parliament your Government your party and your electorate It is very likely that once again we will be left alone Mr Sánchez voting against your new tug We do n't care we also stand alone voting against your unconstitutional states of alarm we also stand alone in this House voting against climate law and we also stand alone in the motion of censure that we are presenting against you We 're used to it We feel accompanied by more and more Spaniards Mr. Sanchez we do n't want to be your accomplices It 's ruining Spain you and your climate policies They are not plagues that arise because of their tastes or the effort to desecrate graves no it is their policies that bring ruin on the international stage And he comes here and tells us about superfluous spending about public spending laughs at those we propose to lower taxes says they have already put the AIReF to monitor superfluous spending Here is another bubble Sanchez increases the Ministry of Presidency 's budget for advertising by 2300 the money will be spent on advertisements on radios

#SantiagoAbascalConde,Thank you very much Madam President What a delight you have Mr Sánchez after yesterday you come here and dare to speak of pride but of the pride of others Imagine the credibility for us of the speech you made after listening to something like that Look Mr. Sanchez you as long as you 're still sitting there are willing to do anything The same has brought to this House the blackmails of its separatist and communist partners which increase inequalities and division among the Spanish which is offered as the butler of those Brussels bureaucrats to whom no one has chosen Mr Sánchez the price that costs you to keep sitting there for all Spanish people day by day cannot continue to fall on the citizens pockets It is true that your autocrat delusions which have eroded coexistence prosperity and fundamental rights are a characteristic and a responsibility exclusively of you but it is also true that with regard to the great decisions you simply simply obey and follow the instructions that transfer you from that ideological and bureaucratic oligarchy that is contrary to the interests of Spain and to which you die of desire to belong Those oligarchies and those powerful ones whom he apparently attacks but to whom he obeys have learned nothing from the crises of this century and you have referred to some of them or perhaps they have learned and we have suffered that the recipe is to continue to accumulate power and money as they erode democracy and degrade the well being of citizens So it happened in the 2008 crisis to which you referred then I will talk about the 2015 crisis and then the current crisis too that crisis in which a few the rich were richer and the poor poorest Then bipartisanism Mr Sánchez I think you know what I 'm going to talk about managed to load a national institution like the savings banks which did a gigantic social work and were a heritage of all the Spaniards a savings banks that were then handed over to the banks once they had been looted If I remember correctly I think you were then advisor to one of them Caja Madrid From that crisis comes the huge gap that separates the ruling class from the peoples of Europe and today we have seen here that you come without tie for ideological delusions while the ujieres have to keep coming in their uniform Having sat next to you with the new communists who seemed to have come from the 15 M mobilizations has simply made the citizens fatten the bill we have to pay because there are more charges to place This gap widened years later with the 2015 migration crisis and the continuing drip of Islamist attacks then revealed the failure of multicultural societies At that time from the offices or from their mansions the powerful welcomed thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants and all disguised them as refugees and sang the kindnesses of unlimited immigration that they said we needed for our birth crisis and also according to some CEOs of large companies because it would serve to lower wages It was others who suffered the consequences of this so called effect on the labour market on the streets or on their bodies without even being able to complain because there has not been a single day when the media have not marked those who oppose these policies of xenophobics and racists One day it will be judged how politicians and journalists have insulted their own peoples and stigmatized them in the Western world The same elites who told Europeans in 2008 that the crisis was theirs was from Europe said in 2015 that it was also our fault it was from Europe that we suffered from Islamization insecurity or problems of coexistence The blame for you is always on others who are the most humble who are the ones below who are the weakest and who are the victims of their policies It 's never your fault Mr. Sanchez This migration crisis was the second major attack on the well being of Europeans Then throughout Europe there has been a reaction which you cannot deny to that compulsory multiculturalism and to the suicidal goodism of bureaucrats professional politicians multinationals and the media We have just seen it in Italy we have seen it in Sweden and already a long time ago in Poland and Hungary half of France has already reacted and Spain will be no less when the Spanish are given back their voice and vote Today in 2022 the pandemic inflation and the current energy crisis doubtless have drawn a new scenario And you intend to leave in the same way as in the previous ones by accumulating power without democratic controls even the Constitutional Court has struck you by increasing the fortunes of the big multinationals by increasing taxes on the self employed and by increasing the public debt that the next generations will have to pay and then by distributing crumbs and subsidies to the citizens to whom the future and prosperity have previously been stolen That 's your recipe Mr. Sanchez That 's your recipe Socialist and Communist gentlemen It 's what they 've always done it 's all they know how to do If they had taken note of the previous crises they would be able to descend from the donkey of the climate religion which is already just the excuse to throw once again at those who have less Because out of the crisis we do not trample on the humble give more sovereignty or avoid democratic controls out of the crisis we protect our interests and our rights And if sacrifices are to be asked they are asked to set an example Mr Sánchez by not climbing the floor of the government and politicians in this House Mr Sánchez the war in Europe would not have occurred if the European leaders had not placed us in the hands of Russia and China giving our prosperity and sovereignty Putin pays his weapons with the gas you buy him and you buy him from Russia four times more gas than you bought him ruining by the way Spanish homes to pay those bills We have told you several times in this situation continuing to talk about ecological transition is a macabre joke First because euphemism offends as you call the ecological transition to the imposition of a climate superstition that has with its measures no beneficial effect on the planet but that has become the new big business of the woke multinationals and of course of those anti-democratic regimes that claim to fight but that laugh and strengthen themselves with the restrictions that by their fault we impose ourselves So no energy transition Mr Sánchez energy betrayal is exactly what this Congress voted for That is why the first thing and the main thing that has to be done by a government that thinks about the economy and the middle and popular classes but also an opposition that presumes to know how to manage and square the accounts is to repeal the infamous climate law passed a year ago in this Congress It is true that much of this nonsense is driven by Brussels but your Government with the sole opposition of VOX in this House has gone beyond banning the exploitation of our natural and energy resources I have had the opportunity to talk to the international leaders about that vote in Congress and they do not believe it they find it very difficult to understand that you maintain a criminal law that condemns us to ruin and cold It is nonsense that is only explained for two reasons for the fanaticism of some and for the dark interests of others Because the reality is that Spain has the possibility to produce much of the energy needed to meet the needs of the Spanish since there are reserves of hydrocarbons in the national territory for more than seventy years and that nuclear power plants could be supplied with Spanish uranium mines In Spain ladies and gentlemen we have said it before there is gas there is oil there is lithium so important at the moment and there is coal which we can not yet dispense with In addition we have the fortune that there is sun that there is wind that there are preys and that there are heights to be able to accumulate energy through water Therefore ladies and gentlemen the destruction of thermal power stations must be halted urgently nuclear power must be resumed by extending the lives of existing power stations and planning the opening of new power stations the emptying of reservoirs must be halted the blasting of dams must be brought to an end a general plan must be developed for the sensible and sustainable exploitation and exploration of all our natural resources must be developed and not banned in this Congress pressure must be put on to modify the current pricing system which is made exclusively for the benefit of German industry the CO2 duty market must be eliminated which is an ideological tax not to say a religious tax it must be brought to an end with the rotating doors in the electricity companies in which all of you end sooner than later taxes must be drastically reduced and a predictable international policy which is endorsed by this Congress and is based solely on the national interests and not on Mr Sánchez 's strange whims We have long demanded that you take these measures Well it is true that we have also asked him to leave and let go of those who put their national interest before the personal interests of sitting on that chair If you had taken note of the sovereign reaction to the 2015 crisis you would have set aside your international agendas and its submission to undemocratic powers Because what you bring us here today are crumbs it 's propaganda it 's bread for today and hunger for tomorrow it 's public debt for generations and generations and it's makeup to make a speech in Congress There is no deep rectification Mr Sánchez and there is not a restorative spirit of the prosperity of the elections but an intention to reach the elections with better electoral prospects That 's the only thing that moves you There will be no substantial improvement in the dramatic reality that the Spaniards suffer until we address the great structural change that Spain needs in terms of energy that is a door to the oligarchies and an open door to the common people Mr Sánchez we agree that we must tax the extraordinary benefits of electricity which have been enriched indecently with the legislation which has been approved indecently by you all that must also be said and it is favourable to those electricity companies in which you end up working And all this has happened while the purchasing power of the families fell into the ground The problem is that you want to confiscate that money in order to give it to the ministry of the skirts at the traffic lights and to the ministry of the toy strike or to give it to Bill Gates who the poor guy must miss Hey Mr. Sanchez I do n't know why you 're scandalized What scandals the Spaniards is that you give the money of the Spaniards to a millionaire If when the Spaniards throw you and you will do so as soon as you have the opportunity you dream of entering the service of some millionaire or with some great European armchair do not do so with taxpayers money please We say that we must ensure that one hundred per cent of what is collected is intended to improve the lives of the Spaniards to a real social bonus to a radical drop in electricity and gas bills and to help the most vulnerable I repeat one hundred per cent nothing to Mrs Montero 's ministry which should be closed tomorrow and if another important percentage is added to that that the State will provide it to compensate for the fallen VAT from heaven Because the State has also been enriched as a usurer with the suffering of the people and has money to give it to the people who need it to live It is necessary to recover the usual housing deduction at the IRPF ladies and gentlemen so that Spanish mortgage lenders can deduct as in the past all the interest they pay and thus face the rise in rates and it is necessary to extend the deduction to the whole nation for rental costs at the IRPF By the way I 've seen you here applaud the social security the social state public education I did n't know you guys made it up Who exactly were they applauding What we do know is that in Spain there has been a social state and a public education with far fewer taxes than there are now We know that you are not going to do anything we ask you to do because you have not learned anything from the previous crises and therefore you have to hide and the Spaniards beat you where you go Yesterday you were very bad Mr. Sánchez for the second year in a row making the Head of State wait You can't do that Save those ridiculous infiltrators for Brussels to see if they can stand them there because here you have to set an example of respect for the institutions for the Head of State for the separation of powers and for the rule of law They pity you or they do n't pity you it 's their obligation I assure you that it is not so serious that politicians pity us others have stoned us and it is so much more serious If you had learned anything from those crises you would have known that among the Spaniards there is an irrepressible desire for sovereignty and to be the owners of our destiny and a conviction that no more others whoever they are decide for the Spaniards we do n't care whether they are unscrupulous bureaucrats high media or frivolous politicians We ask you again to step aside and return the word to the Spaniards Dare to ask the Spanish people about these matters on which they are so sure the same is taken a surprise and they check that the consensus which you believed to be so solid is nothing more than the sum of thousands and thousands of drowned dissents The Spanish must decide and have the right to do so Article 92 of the Constitution has only been applied in Spain twice to vote on the EU and NATO referendums Never in forty years of democracy have the Spaniards been asked about the public policies that have affected them And indeed the voters of the various parties can agree on a lot of things but if you dare to ask whether the Spanish want to explore our energy resources or continue paying the most expensive bills if the Spanish want illegal and disorderly immigration or legal immigration or if the Spanish want the gender policies that you have approved and that end with freedom and equality I have no doubt that the voters of the left and right would vote the same they would vote against what you have imposed on the citizens backs Thank you very

#LourdesMéndezMonasterio,Anyway ladies and gentlemen you should reflect You should reflect and put the video in which you will be able to hear the minister We must reflect very seriously ladies and gentlemen We can only choose to submit to this cultural offensive or react defending our convictions our tradition and our culture At this point there are no half inks because if in the face of this offensive that the Spaniards are suffering with an unprecedented state violence full of lies one gets profiled and does not oppose convictions our nation will not be able to survive and the culture of globalism and death will end up triumphing Many of you are trapped by the prevailing globalism and relativism the hour of secularism or the possibilityism that wrongly overwhelms the moral principle of lesser evil Ladies and gentlemen I have said the need to defend our convictions rather than beliefs Our party is not a confessional party but ladies and gentlemen it is not necessary to believe in God although it is very convenient to have the conviction that the value of a life is the one that must inform a fair rule of law a human society and an honest legislator Deep down ladies and gentlemen it 's a titanic struggle There are two antagonistic models who defends the basic humanism of Western culture and all others The globalist culture full of the ally of cultural Marxism and the humanist culture of Christian roots that made the West great cannot coexist in the same way that a democratic state cannot coexist with communism Ladies and gentlemen all ideologies stand up against the humanism of Christian roots Not in vain the European modernity that has given the world the democratic ideal and human rights take on the very values of its Christian heritage Nietzsche's God is dead has given way to 'we will be as gods The consideration of the person with a value in himself or herself in relation to other considerations Basically ladies and gentlemen the question is always the same rebel against the natural order against the very being of man It is the rebellion of the creature against its own creature being the abandonment of philosophical reason and truth that makes us free That is why its consequences are so serious and why for those who want to annihilate our future it is so decisive Why are they so afraid of VOX We give them a lot of fear so they insult us call us fascists extreme right and laugh We give them much fear because we have come to tell the truth and the truth bothers them bothers them creates difficulties and confronts them with their own reality because we have come to denounce that their progress is lies ladies and gentlemen that they are puppets of elites that lead us to destruction because we have come to say that abortion is to kill a human being and a drama for women and to defeat their empty slogans because we have come to say that women are left alone and that they have never been so unprotected so deceived and so lack of support and humanity because we have come to adhere to life from conception to their natural death and because we have come to protect pregnant women the natural family for the social function they perform and our children from their perversions That 's what scares them so much We scare them because their weapon is the lie and that lie succumbs to reason and word We scare them because that 's our strength We fear them because they know that we can build a nation upon the truth and that will make us indestructible Do n't ask us ladies and gentlemen none of VOX what we propose so that you can abort as if it were something good Ask us ladies and gentlemen what are we going to do so that a woman can have a child with complete freedom Then we 'll answer them We ladies and gentlemen care for and defend women we do not blame them To whom we blame it is to all of you We have come to open horizons that were hidden and this is what scares you so much We have not come to impose anything ladies and gentlemen we have come to propose that another path is possible Now it is ladies and gentlemen Now I do The introduction of the absolutely irregular right to abortion in the United States XIV amendment has fortunately been reversed although it has taken fifty years We 'll take less Faced with the culture of death VOX defends life from conception to natural extinction Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,27.833496,18.266989,18,anyway ladies gentlemen reflect reflect put video able hear minister must reflect seriously ladies gentlemen choose submit cultural

#JoséMaríaSánchezGarcía,With venial Mr. President This is an initiative of the Republican and Bildu parliamentary groups presented in the Senate which comes from that House where it has already been taken into consideration but whose content is essentially coincident with other previous legislative proposals debated in September 2021 and October 2020 at the respective initiative of Podemos and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya initiatives which also postulate the repeal of articles 490.3 491 and 543 of the Criminal Code on insults and slanders to the king and outrages to Spain Then since 2019 among initiatives of communist groups and separatist groups the suppression of such crimes against the head of State and against Spain once a year is discussed in this House What an unpatriotic perseverance You remind me for these purposes so alien to any civilized order of coexistence of Gustavo the Incongruent character of Gomez de la Serna who defended a doctoral thesis consisting of the right of everyone to do whatever he wanted You believe that you have the right to say in insulting or slanderous terms what you want of the king of Spain as head of state and to outrage which is a term with a semantic content of serious offense not a slight offense to Spain If you believe that this is consistent with I repeat a civilized order of coexistence you have either really lost your mind or fall into this ridiculous character of our best literature Knowing this it is to be seen that on this occasion and after the previous two there is a significant change and it is that on the previous occasions these gentlemen who sit on this side of the House of the Socialist Party have opposed it But now curiously I do not know whether for a reason of spring that blood alters in May 2022 they voted in favour of taking this proposal into consideration whose amendments we are all debating at today 's sitting On the previous occasion he took the word of Mrs Isaura Leal who is listening to me carefully I think and to whom I take the opportunity to always greet respectfully and adhere to her position of opposition to that initiative which today became enthusiasm for a senator of the Socialist Group I do n't know if there 's really a spring seasonal solstice motive here I do n't know what to think anymore I think there is a much simpler explanation and it is that the table was approaching that of the dialogue that you so much like Well they like it I do n't know if they like it or not They like what the dialogue table and its agreements also anti-patriotic provide What they like is that instrument for Mr Sánchez to continue in La Moncloa There is no clause on this in such agreements There is a general clause in one of them in the first on strengthening fundamental rights in short a vaporous ethereal thing almost constitutional lyric but that we all know that among other things it covers or protects these purposes as I say recalcitrant of these groups that are clearly contrary to the constitutional order as we all know because they manifest it so every five minutes I imagine what was the dialogue not the dialogue at the table in which the Minister of Propaganda Mr Bolaños participated the dialogue that had to be established perhaps by phone or by WhatsApp or what I know by what means with La Moncloa and with his inhabitant who is the head of the Minister of Propaganda I will not say what I said on another occasion is not that someone gets shocked Esquerra Republicana and its partners by the way I think you have broken the government pact it seems I do not know if this will serve anything for Spain we will see in the next few days let us trust that it will you would say We want to insult and slander the king freely we want to freely outrage Spain ad libitum without fees without limitation And Sanchez 's answer on the other side of the phone or whatever the means of transmission of the communication would be It would take more We could get this far But you will have seen that someone intends to prevent and on top of it to prosecute criminally that he insults and slanders the king and that he insults Spain Of course Sure Let 's support them We 've already supported them Trust us We 've said it in May in the Senate And then already with the Journal of Sessions we would be told Do not put it in the agreement that if it is already there in writing collected as a record in the Journal of Sessions of the Senate This goes into the suffo genre because it has no basis but being suffo at the same time it is serious because it is supported by the Government And if the government supports it what 's going to happen here Mrs. Isaura and the socialist spokesman Don Patxi Are you going to support him too here in this House now All the arguments that derail the proposition 's explanatory statement are not entirely false arguments to tell the truth with a certain intellectual honesty but partly false then in any case by that biased partial fallacies The judgement in the Stern and Roura case against Spain was invoked by the proposed law I have already said in some previous intervention on the occasion of those failed considerations that this sentence had not been pronounced in rigour on these criminal types it had been pronounced on the existence of a speech of hatred in the burning of a portrait of the King of Spain in Catalonia as a manifestation of freedom of expression so there was no pronouncement on this which you say is unequivocal about that they should be repealed That 's not true The judgment was also expressed in very casuistic terms i.e. very attentive to the circumstances i.e. the burning of the portrait Made of its reprehensible because it is a serious offense to the Lord who burns himself even if it is in his image although we do not know if you would have wished a burning in a pyre this is already another day if you want to tell us because your frenzy coup is considerable In a few years you have given two coups d'état you like it as soon as you have an opportunity you do It was a political manifestation in these terms it was an excess but the court somehow excuses it but no it does not agree with what you say You also cite the Otegi judgment in which it is true that it was said that the reputation of the head of state does not have to be protected in principle in a way superior to the reputation of other people But watch out for the Otegi sentence because you guys are hiding Always with lies ahead this is the guiding principle of your performance If you start lying about the history of Catalonia imagine what you are going to say about the Spanish monarchy Then lies without limits It says the amendment to the whole of Citizens that the Otegi ruling says that there is criticism of the figure of the head of state what is not to be insulted or slandered which is what you want You want to insult and slander freely because you do not like it because you consider what I know that it is the protagonist of an oppression and things of these This criterion that of the Otegi judgment was the same as that adopted by the Constitutional Court in a judgement subsequent to that of Otegi in Judgment 177/2015 before the existence of the Stern and Roura judgment Exactly the same i.e. freedom of expression protects a criticism of the head of State what is not to be insulted slandered and of course not to be outraged by Spain among other things because these types of protection are not the person of the head of State but rather what it represents which in Spanish law is the State itself the national unity and the permanence of that State article 56.1 and protects the institutions the Constitutional Court also says as a representation of what is Spain The comparative law does not give you any reason the comparative law I also had the opportunity to express it in previous speeches allows us to observe that in the republican France there is still the offence of insulting the head of State with the same penalty of fine as that which punishes insults to ministers or deputies In the republican Italy with four crimes of political vilipendio the president of the republic the republic the nation and the flag There is a 1964 Constitutional Court ruling that declared the type of 290 constitutional which is the vilipendium of the republic Other European republics of the Union Bulgaria Germany Greece Poland Portugal and Malta also include types with this scope and content By the way Mr. Asens left him for a liar I do n't see him today I 'm sorry but I would have wanted to ask Newtral who is very close to all of you a manipulator who makes truths the doer of truth like that absolute

#JoséMaríaSánchezGarcía,Well parties that have supported and support the commission of crimes in the recent past and in the not so recent past and that we trust that they will not do so in the present or in the future although we are very afraid that they can return to the steps Then there are the inane parties that is the useless the empty those who do nothing in emergency situations We also know what they are I will not say so as not to offend anyone but they will feel identified And then according to Michels there would be the doctrinal or ideological parties among which VOX and Mr Martínez Oblanca would certainly be among them This proposal is important because in fact it does remedy albeit not sufficiently the problem of non-admission of amparo resources The problem of non-admission of amparo remedies is such that as stated in the explanatory statement 97 of the amparo remedies in 2020 the year in which that text was submitted were not allowed to proceed through an unreasoned measure This is what is intended to remedy this proposal of law as it requests that the non-admission be by a resolution motivated by the form of self But this is not enough because what VOX proposed almost at the same time as this proposed law by means of a non-law proposal was that the ordinary remedy of amparo is regulated which is the main remedy of amparo established by article 53.2 of the Constitution and that for forty four years it is said soon People 's Party Socialist Party and all the forces represented in this House have decided not to regulate So all there is is a constitutional amparo remedy with this rate of non-admission that makes it practically meaningless for any justiciable and for the professionals of the forum It is a resource conceived as a subsidiary in the same article 53.2 an omission that has no explanation but which shows that to this terrible bipartisanism that has devastated Spain with the collaboration of many present PNV Catalan nationalists when they were not net independenceists etc. it does not like the protection of fundamental rights Moreover it does not matter absolutely anything or very little as we are seeing Finally as has been said here I will repeat that today is a bad day Mr Martínez Oblanca I am sorry or a good day what I know for us to discuss this issue because today is a sad day If a year ago in November 2021 on the day that PP and PSOE agreed to the renewal of the Constitutional Court by electing four judges I said that it was a sad very sad day today I must say that I am exhausted to say how sad it is this day because the Government has decided as was otherwise foreseeable to appoint two judges of the court with a net party profile a former government minister and a former director general of the Ministry of the Presidency Net partisanship in the profiles of these appointees which once again demonstrates what we already know that is that the Government does not believe in the Constitution at all that the Government is willing to violate it under any circumstances and by any means and that in order for all its constitutional violations to be blessed it has proposed to the Constitutional Court these two names so that where appropriate when they have to prosecute unconstitutionality remedies the Constitutional Court does not declare the initiatives appealed as unconstitutional and therefore the Spanish law continues to be fed by unconstitutional rules It is further evidence of the bipartisan vices of the party in this case that destroy the political regime of 1978,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,31.182325,9.508877,18,well parties supported support commission crimes recent past recent past trust present future although afraid return steps inane parties useless empty nothing emergency situations also know say offend anyone feel identified according michels would doctrinal ideological parties among vox mr martínez oblanca would certainly among

#JoséMaríaSánchezGarcía,With the venom The opinion of the United Nations Human Rights Committee of 12 July 2022 published in August is not binding on Spain as is no opinion of that body as the Supreme Court has affirmed until exhaustion Do not be led by the mirage of the judgment of 17 July 2018 of that court which has held that such an opinion may be the basis for an action for claim of patrimonial liability for abnormal functioning of justice Because in the case prosecuted by that sentence it was that the actor had reported to the court up to forty seven times the risk of her daughter 's death at the hands of her ex-husband or person with whom she lived without meriting proper guardianship of the judiciary and despite psychological expert reports,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,33.18156,11.251136,18,venom opinion united nations human rights committee 12 july 2022 published august binding spain opinion body supreme court affirmed exhaustion led mirage judgment 17 july 2018 court held opinion may basis action claim patrimonial liability abnormal functioning justice case prosecuted sentence actor reported court forty seven times risk daughter 's death hands ex-husband person lived without meriting proper guardianship judiciary despite psychological expert reports
#JoséMaríaSánchezGarcía,reports from social services etc Then nothing comparable to the prosecution that is the subject of this opinion which as I say does not oblige Spain in terms of non-compliance unless there is a provision of domestic law which establishes this and it is not the case in Spain On the recommendations addressed to Spain by Resolution 2381/2021 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe based on the so called Civics report the name of the Latvian deputy vice president of the democratic and green socialists in that parliamentary assembly it is falsely said in the motion of the Republican Left of Catalonia that this resolution was already under consideration at the last session of the Parliamentary Assembly in June this year It is said falsely because what is omitted is that this resolution was not adopted but that it fell expressly at the will of the proposer himself the picturesque Member Mr Cilevics who seems to be very interested in the Catalan and Spanish affairs because of a number of successful amendments some Members who I see sitting here from the Socialist Group were present to delete all the references to Spain and only the references to the Republic of Turkey remain Then he cheats on us or pretends to cheat on us but as you see he does n't hang I was present in that picturesque vote promoted by such a picturesque parliamentarian of a Baltic republic In the light of the above it is questionable whether ERC will be equally jealous of compliance with international law for example whether the Court of Justice of the European Union following the conclusions of Advocate General Richard De la Tour of 14 July 2022 i.e. before yesterday cannot deny the execution of a European arrest warrant on a ground based on the national law of the requested State as well as cannot deny such execution solely on the basis of a review of the jurisdiction of the examining judge of the requesting State nor can it deny the execution of the European arrest warrant on the basis of a hypothetical unfair trial that would be instituted by virtue of the execution of the arrest warrant unless it says in the general conclusions it has objective reliable accurate and duly updated data proving that there is a real risk of a violation of the fundamental right to a fair trial due to systemic deficiencies things that do not exist in the case of Spanish law What will be the position of the Government of the Generality,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,35.083977,11.312722,18,reports social services etc nothing comparable prosecution subject opinion say oblige spain terms non-compliance unless provision domestic law establishes case spain recommendations addressed spain resolution 2381/2021 parliamentary assembly council europe based called civics report name latvian deputy vice president democratic green socialists parliamentary assembly falsely said motion republican left catalonia resolution already consideration last session parliamentary assembly june year said falsely omitted resolution adopted fell expressly proposer picturesque member mr cilevics seems interested catalan spanish affairs number successful amendments members see sitting socialist group present delete references spain references republic turkey remain cheats us pretends cheat us see n't hang present picturesque vote promoted picturesque parliamentarian baltic republic light questionable whether erc equally jealous compliance international law example whether court justice european union following conclusions advocate general richard de la tour 14 july 2022 i.e. yesterday cannot deny execution european arrest warrant ground based national law requested state well cannot deny execution solely basis review jurisdiction examining judge requesting state deny execution european arrest warrant basis hypothetical unfair trial would instituted virtue execution arrest warrant unless says general conclusions objective reliable accurate duly updated data proving real risk violation fundamental right fair trial due systemic deficiencies things exist case spanish law position government generality
#JoséMaríaSánchezGarcía,Thank you What will be the position of the Government of the Generality if the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union follows the conclusions of the Advocate General and therefore determines that the refusal of the execution of the arrest warrant in the Puig i Gordi case and eventually in that of Mr Puigdemont and others is contrary to European law What 's it gonna be We suppose that we oppose Belgium 's handing over Puigdemont Puig i Gordi and others to Spain to the Spanish courts to be tried or at best they take advantage of the circumstance to sacrifice them now that the ERC's with Junts are misled and they want to put an end to the glorious existence their nationalist fervour and their veneration of international legality The national Government had to sue the Kingdom of Belgium after the judgment of 7 June 2021 of the Brussels Court of Appeal which refused the extradition of Puig i Gordi to sue the Court of Justice of the European Union under Article 259 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union after complaint to the Commission But what can be expected of a Government like this which signed in July 2022 a pact at that table of disgusting dialogue in which it says that it supports Catalan law,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,34.870716,10.488087,18,thank position government generality judgment court justice european union follows conclusions advocate general therefore determines refusal execution arrest warrant puig gordi case eventually mr puigdemont others contrary european law 's gonna suppose oppose belgium 's handing puigdemont puig gordi others spain spanish courts tried best take advantage circumstance sacrifice erc's junts misled want put end glorious existence nationalist fervour veneration international legality national government sue kingdom belgium judgment 7 june 2021 brussels court appeal refused extradition puig gordi sue court justice european union article 259 treaty functioning european union complaint commission expected government like signed july 2022 pact table disgusting dialogue says supports catalan law
#JoséMaríaSánchezGarcía,With all due respect Madam President Before I make an orderly statement of the reasons for our opposition to this proposal for organic law I will make some reference to the things I have just heard A spokesman a Catalan independenceist who I cannot identify by his name will forgive me but Catalan independenceists are like repeated chromes all he said crude argument the principle of criminal legality Burdo argument has said this gentleman I suppose he has not studied Law and if he has studied it I suppose he will not exercise any legal profession because of course I do not know what would be the fate of his clients Another has said nostalgia of the dictatorship I interpret that referring to VOX and PP or PP and VOX Well we have no nostalgia for any dictatorship what you do have and profess is love for the dictatorships present as you credit every day with your support for the Castro Bolivarian and whatever dictatorships of the communist world are and remain A third I think it was Mr Asens said that there are no half inks here No they do n't fit And what do you tell me Mr Asens that it has had to be a Commission of the European Parliament which in 2022 your report has not yet been published will urge the Kingdom of Spain to investigate the crimes of the ETA that have not been investigated or tried Has this forgotten you along the way The three the four already the five are forgotten by the way the sixty million dead killed by the Maoist Republic of China sixty million Neither are these What kind of ink are these the average the red the blue or what Or the twenty million of the Soviet Union this does not seem to you to be relevant either Well the intention of this bill is a political political intention of all its proponents including surprisingly the Basque Nationalist Party the Basque Nationalist Party which as I said last week participated in the government of the Popular Front that emerged from the fraudulent elections of February 1936 in the person of Manuel Irujo Yeah I remind you in case you do not know that Irujo made it a condition for his participation in his party to put an end to religious repression in Spain religious repression that has given rise according to the documented study that dates back to 1961 by Antonio Montero to 6832 murders of clergy and religious Do n't these get in the inks either Mr. Asens What kind of ink are they black by the caskets Or what ink is this black by the red of the shed blood It is a shame that you come to say these things here you can say them in your rallies with the intention of deceiving your voters who in good faith or naively can believe it here you would not have to have the shame of saying these things because some of us know some of the history of Spain of course more than you no doubt and not with that sectarian spirit that characterizes you Mr De Irujo Don Manuel who rested in peace on January 9 1937 presented his memorandum in the Council of Ministers still chaired by Largo Caballero about religious repression in a very harsh tone I have here texts that reproduce or transcribe the written words that he presented at that meeting of the Council and demanded an end to this religious persecution The Council of Ministers unanimously opposed and Mr De Irujo did not resign not only did he not resign but he agreed to participate in a government as criminal as the previous one which was that of Dr Negrin since May 1937 So the Basque Nationalist Party as I said last week also needs to shut up on this issue and should not adhere to such ignominious propositions But besides the intention there is the realization and the realization must be judged according to the intention according to Ortega of the literary work in The Viewer And here the realization is legally impossible and I will explain it briefly Spain acceded in 1968 to the 1948 United Nations Convention on Genocide and in 1971 reformed its Criminal Code during the Franco regime to introduce the crime of genocide under the terms of the convention The terms of the convention and the Penal Code thus drafted under that 1971 reform as well as the 1995 Penal Code of the democratic period the work of the Socialist Party Mr González ruled and Mr Belloch was Minister of Justice a magistrate collected the crime of genocide as well as what they called crimes of the law of peoples That text had subsequently been reformed and it had been maintained that persecution to be classified as genocide must be national racial ethnic or religious not political Political persecution would only be a crime against humanity now in force in the Criminal Code but it is not possible to judge even in accordance with what you claim to be a standard of customary international law facts that have taken place during Francoism or during the first years of the Transition because such invocation of customary international criminal law today is not possible under the unequivocal fact that such criminal law is already codified at least partially since the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court of 1998,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,37.527447,12.7167225,18,due

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much The Spanish need to know why VOX considers it essential that there be a third power in Spain the Judicial Power free and independent of any interference of political parties We have talked many times about reasons that address constitutional issues political issues even issues of the efficiency of the administration of justice itself but it may be much easier to understand if we put on the table in this debate in our amendment to the whole three examples of why when justice is left alone it does justice no more or less When political parties let 's put two examples the Socialist Party and the PNV decide to agree to destroy a part of our historical architectural cultural environmental heritage when they agree to trample the law and common sense it is necessary to have an independent justice I am referring to the barracks of Loiola an alphonsian style military building in San Sebastián Gipuzkoa home of the glorious infantry regiment Tercio Viejo of Sicily n.o 67 In the enterprising pact between the Socialist Party and the PNV it was decided to proceed with the following plan one it will be excluded from the special urban protection within the special protection plan of the City of San Sebastián in Gipuzkoa two once excluded from protection are disaffected from the interest for national defense and therefore of the Armed Forces more specifically of the Army three once disaffected would proceed to the complete demolition of the barracks of Loiola they have heard well converting their facades their shields their courtyards their roofs their historical beams into a pile of rubble that went to the landfill and four putting on top a real estate operation of the City of San Sebastián Once again yes once again and although it weighs us we would have liked to be accompanied by other political parties for example the People 's Party But no it could n't have been this time either as it was not when we filed in solitary the complaints that sat on the bench to the coupts of Catalonia in 2017 or when we brought to the Constitutional Court among other resources also in solitary gentlemen of the People 's Party the fraudulent or unconstitutional states of alarm or when the freedom and control that this Parliament should exercise is sought Only VOX reacted in court Well on this occasion to which I refer VOX initiated a legal action with its corresponding cost with its expert reports of urbanism historical and legal in order to achieve as it has been a historical judgment that has been issued by the Superior Court of Justice of the Basque Country declaring the barracks of Loiola Good of Cultural Interest of special protection one of the maximum urbanistic protections To turn it into rubble to equivalence with the Palace of the Diputation or with the Kursaal Center itself VOX with this action has not only managed to prevent the demolition of a historic building of a singular building which although very important is less so VOX has managed to avoid with this legal action that becomes rubble what is nothing but a symbol of history a symbol of Spain a memory and a symbol of our Armed Forces And since VOX does not stop as VOX does not ask permission or forgiveness when it has to act I am already advancing them and I will not extend myself in this two more examples in which the action of VOX and the action of a justice without being conditioned by political parties will first succeed in sitting on the bench in Andalusia mayors of the Socialist Party the People 's Party and Podemos for the tremendous corruption issue that means Giahsa and second bringing the National High Court and the Supreme Court to the fugitive coupt Puigdemont as the European Court is already recognizing us Ladies and gentlemen these are three examples that show the Spaniards and we could be setting examples all day today and tomorrow that when justice is allowed politicians who trample on the law disregard the Constitution and violate fundamental rights and public freedoms are put in their place In this amendment to the whole of VOX that it has submitted with alternative text compared to the proposed law of the Socialist Parliamentary Group for the amendment of article 570 bis of the Organic Law of the Judiciary VOX recalls once again in this rostrum that article 117 of the Constitution gives the mandate to judges and magistrates who must act only subject to the rule of law and nothing more than the rule of law Article 122.3 therefore established in the Constitution that of the twenty members of the General Council of the Judiciary eight unfortunately would be elected by politicians by political parties four by Congress and four by the Senate Twenty members however decided the constituents and therefore the Spanish people that the majority twelve of its members would not have political origin would not have parliamentary origin and would therefore be elected by and from among the judges Although some would like to twist the Constitution only eight would have to come from the election of political parties Congress and the Senate the other twelve would have to come out of judges and magistrates Only the Judicial Power Act 1980 respected this constitutional mandate respected this constitutional spirit that the majority of the General Council of the Judiciary should be an independent body from the interferences interests and corruptions of political parties But the 1985 law came and it was the Socialist Party yes in the first place that repealed it to carry out the election of those twelve members also by the decision of political parties of Congress and the Senate And I say first of all because it was the Socialist Party but the People 's Party is no less responsible He had absolute majorities and only made makeup that did not change the essence of the problem The essence of the problem ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party is that you continue to decide together with the Socialist Party and its partners who sit on the General Council of the Judiciary which is as much as saying who sit on the Supreme Court on the high courts on the Constitutional Court on the Court of Auditors and on many other bodies that have already been mentioned here today In short since the 1985 law this perversion which has been the appropriation by the Legislature and the Executive of the third power of the State is unfortunately maintained And here is our proposal our amendment to the whole and also of course our proposal to the Spaniards in which we would like we say it loud and clear to have the support of other parties especially the People 's Party The VOX proposal is clear and is based on four principles first that according to the Constitution those twelve members of the General Council of the Judiciary who are to be elected by judges and magistrates are elected by them by all the categories of judges and magistrates who are active that it is through personal vote equal vote direct vote and secret vote that it is in a single constituency for the whole of Spain without any condition or endorsement as it has now been intended neither of a personal nature nor of associations of any political nature however much they all say that they are professional and lastly that the elected cannot in any way be those who are national or autonomous deputies or senators or councillors in active or have been in the previous legislation because of the direct link they have with political parties that in the last four years they have not been part of the electoral lists in political parties and that in the last four years they have not held or held high office in the Administration for the appointment of political power With this I would not win VOX with this I would not win any political party they would win freedom justice and independence The question we ask ourselves is why the rest of the political parties except for some exceptions with makeup did not want to raise this flag for the division of powers and for the independence of the judiciary At the beginning of my speech I gave three examples Unfortunately there are many more and new examples will come in which we will only be safe for the Spaniards if we can count on the guarantees of a judicial power that in no way in its choice or operation depends on the interference of any political party of any party and of course never of the Government of the nation Thank you very

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much President I am speaking on behalf of the VOX Parliamentary Group which out of decency does not continue to sit in the seats before a plenary that is absolutely fraudulent and especially when we are faced with an unacceptable and disgusting climate of violence and threat by different deputies of the extreme left of the Sánchez Government against the judges of the Constitutional Court which is the same as against the judiciary as a whole saying and affirming that they would not tolerate any toga putting limits on the self government of the people or that the judges were coups with toga In short statements clearly contrary to the Constitution disregarding democracy the separation of powers and the freedom of the Spanish to be legitimately represented in this House and protected by judicial bodies This is nothing other than an assault or institutional coup perfectly planned by Sánchez his Government and the parties that support him which began on 14 November by admitting the Bureau of Government to the processing of this bill to which our group opposed clear regulatory fraud which continued shortly afterwards on 24 November with an extraordinary plenary called urgently for its consideration which was also received with our opposition a few days later on 1 December a new urgent extraordinary plenary to discuss the amendments to the whole as our group did A few days later the speaker was summoned to the Presentation of this law and had to listen with concern and great surprise to how the lawyers of these Courts warned and warned that with the admission of different amendments there was a clear lack of homogeneity absolute disconnection and material inconsistency with the amended text and especially with amendments 61 and 62 which attempt to reform the Organic Law of the Judiciary and the Constitutional Court We request on the same day 12 different written documents from the Bureau which have not yet been resolved calling for the non-admission of the processing of these amendments reports to the Constitutional Court the General Council of the Judiciary the State Advocate the Council of State and the lawyers themselves of this House A day later again in a hurry on 13 December we were called to a Commission of Justice where we again opposed and reiterated the necessary non-admission of this procedure And today today 15 December a new call for an urgent special plenary session for the final vote on the opinion Today we appealed to the Constitutional Court for amparo requesting the interim measure of suspension of the proceedings for obvious violations of fundamental rights constitutional rights And we have to listen after the speech of our spokesman to the only Spanish woman the president of this House who has not heard and who does not know the notoriety of these amparo resources This is in short the situation before us A procedure against which we oppose in substance and in form in law and in procedure a procedure that is a clear procedural fraud a fraud to the law and a very clear unconstitutionality The objectives are not hidden from any of your ladies and gentlemen but not from the Spanish First what the Government and its partners are looking for is a covert amnesty for all coupsmen abrogating the crime of sedition and encouraging them to re-incurrence in it reducing the penalties for corrupt people by reducing penalties for embezzlement of public funds The final political control of the General Council of the Judiciary reducing the necessary majority from three fifths to a simple majority breaking the necessary decision as a collegiate body and reducing the voting of only one of the candidates for the Constitutional Court 's judge for its members In short an assault on the Constitutional Court even abolishing without the slightest shame the procedure of suitability necessary to acquire the status of magistrate and violating the Constitution within the necessary time limits for its renewal rather than by thirds per sixth All this ladies and gentlemen has serious consequences and those who are going to vote in favour of this law are perfectly aware and aware of what they are doing that impunity to those who openly boast that they will again give a coup d'état to those who clearly support the corrupt within their parties and in their governments who clearly claim to be able to adopt clearly unconstitutional rules from now on as indeed were the states of alarm having an absolutely domesticated Constitutional Court and at the service of the Government to succeed in rejecting in this way all the remedies of unconstitutionality that are pending among others the more than forty remedies of unconstitutionality lodged by the VOX Parliamentary Group From today on it will cease to be called the Constitutional Court and turn its name into the governmental court of the Government of Pedro Sánchez By the way Sánchez had already credited his betrayal of Spain today moreover he believes his cowardice not being here when the Constitution and the rule of law are being trampled I 'm finishing up Madam President Today unfortunately it is what we could describe as the death or de facto disappearance of the division of powers of the rule of law democracy and the Constitution Some believe that coups of state are made with weapons and military uniform but those are more visible the most dangerous are the coups of state that are made from within the institutions themselves taking advantage of

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much President Minister in this urgent inquiry by our VOX Parliamentary Group what we are asking you which is on behalf of the Government is what you intend to do to prevent those who want to destroy national unity by trampling on the Constitution and disregarding the national sovereignty of the Spaniards from achieving their goal It is terrible that we have to ask this question this urgent interpellation to a Government of a nation because it should be understood that its main reason is to prevent the enemies of the nation from achieving their objectives But you Minister have been fulfilling the road map marked by the separatists by the coups by the enemies of the nation and you have done so from the first minute step by step sitting to sitting This government was born of the great lie of the great electoral fraud that was that betrayal and transfer that they made to the enemies of the nation betraying their own voters their own voters when they promised the candidate for president in the elections Pedro Sánchez who has put you there who will never deal with those who have blood stained hands that he will never deal with those who had given a coup d'état with those who wanted to destroy Spain and that he will never and would never be able to sleep peacefully if he deals with those of the ration cards the communist totalitarians But he gave in He gave in to sit there on the blue bench and you can sit there The first major assignment Minister I could see it sitting on the benches of the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court when the State Attorney 's Office was instructed that what was a clear and clear accusation of crime against the Constitution of rebellion against the coups of magic not of assignment to the coups became at the stage of prosecution a charge of the State Attorney 's Office of crime against public order of sedition We are now beginning to understand this latest reform of the Criminal Code because they do not want the crime of sedition either And then Minister then what came Do you remember Then came judgments from the Second Chamber and since they could not avoid that condemnation came the wretched unworthy and unwarranted pardons contrary to the law for each and every one of the condemned Do you remember who the Minister of Justice was I 'll tell you Mr. Campos Does that ring a bell He is one of the candidates who now want to put in the Constitutional Court Minister are we still talking about divestitures Then came the assignments to the protera The ETA had to be whitewashed and the Democratic Memory Act created Well memory and democracy have nothing but assignment has a lot Assignment to the ETA to write the story yes the story because then the Transition is delegitimized the Crown is delegitimized and tributes to terrorists are favored of course scorning and trampling on the victims of terrorism Then came the assignment to the PNV minister remember Bildu and PNV Prison powers had to be transferred so that such health reports could be issued by the Basque Government itself For what But what do you think that we do n't realize Then came the next session Minister the approach of prisoners to Basque prisons as a step before health reports that allow them to go out to the street through a fraudulent third degree Minister then came the divestitures removing any presence from the state His majesty the king could not hand over the offices to the magistrates of the judicial career in Catalonia The head of State had to be hidden because he represented national sovereignty he represented national unity Therefore you do nothing for the withdrawal of national teachings and flags in so many public buildings in Catalonia the Basque Country Navarre etc Why Because the presence of the State annoys its separatist partners and therefore a new assignment Then came the assignment that old claim from the fucking terrorist gang ETA you know what it is do n't you That the Navarra Civil Guard had to be removed New assignment to proletarian separatism Then came new assignments How is it that the National Director of the CNI dares to investigate our coup partners No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no But where did this come from In what rule of law is information services allowed to investigate those who want to commit very serious crimes and make coups d'état No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no It was immediately ceased and in addition the CNI was instructed in no way to dare to investigate those who give coups d'état or those who prepare them or violent RCDs or groups declared by various courts as terrorist groups linked to separatism Information services are n't for that no According to you of course New assignments Absolute unprotectiveness to Spanish Of course that the judgment of the Supreme Court ratifies the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of Catalonia that protects that vast majority of Spaniards who want to educate their children in the mother tongue the common language minister the common language Spanish at least in that miserable 25 when their partners from the Generality approve that decree that prevents schooling in Spanish you do not resort to it you do absolutely nothing These assignments we see here every day Do you remember Minister The University law you 've got it on the agenda You have to turn off the Spanish Do you remember the Sports Act also dealt with in this House International competitions must be allowed to go to the national selections of the autonomous communities as if they were countries Do you remember the railway law also dealt with in this House It is that we could list all the laws because in all there is the tuff of the assignment to the enemies of Spain I told him that if he remembers Minister the railway law which also has it on the agenda because I know he has them all pointed out In the morning you tell them what to do and then you come here and do it Under the railway law infrastructure of general interest which has been attached to the national rail network of ADIF or Renfe for centuries can be decommissioned and delivered on a tray to the autonomous governments dismembering a basic national transport infrastructure And so we could follow law after law assignment after assignment minister Are we talking about the Court of Auditors Do you remember that assignment They called him on the phone and said Do n't forget we have opened a file a very serious case in the Court of Auditors for misappropriation of public funds the money fund of all Spaniards The coupts diverted money minister from all the Spaniards and there was an open case in the Court of Auditors And what did your government order in a new assignment That the State Advocate did not file in time and form the corresponding claim and it was filed New assignment to collapsing Are we still talking Are we still talking Minister We have seen it here a few days ago general state budgets to the dictate of the PNV of Bildu of Republican Squerra to the dictate By the way remember what Otegui said Well it 's worth supporting some budgets if this allows us to bring our killers closer to the Basque Country And those budgets plagued and plagued with departures of money to favor the coup makers those who hate Spain for example with the embassies abroad which are a new sign of contempt for that exclusive competence of the State that is foreign policy You allow them to discredit the state and to speak as if Catalonia or the Basque Country were nations Galicia also do not want to forget the Galician embassies Or when you use TV3 for example that machinery of hatred and propaganda at the service of Catalan separatists which you also water in budgets And so Minister cession after cession after cession in these general state budgets The last payment we all know has been political today the crime of sedition had to be repealed that general amnesty covered by the coup From rebellion which they did not like we went to sedition From sedition we go to crimes against public order The next thing Minister come on courage imagination is that instead of a crime we give you a subsidy for a coup d'état Minister laugh but it is the sad reality of what you are doing in Spain you can laugh and smile but to the Spaniards it does not make any grace what you are doing I say it absolutely with regret The embezzlement was also another of the divestitures Since many of its partners are accused or convicted of crimes of embezzlement penalties had to be reduced Moreover by way of an absolutely dantesque procedure with lightness premeditation nocturnality without presenting it as an organic bill to avoid reports and doing so as a bill of the parliamentary groups hurrying and running to see if we do not realize and change the Penal Code so for the bajini The last Mr Minister is the terrible attack on the rule of law on the judiciary through the reforms which have now been suspended I say for the time being by the General Council of the Judiciary and the Constitutional Court in order first of all to ensure that there is no remedy of unconstitutionality such as those of the states of alarm which have prospered thanks to VOX so that you can continue to pass the laws that will please you without a Constitutional Court stopping you and who knows Minister to see if I am imagining too much to favour a separatist referendum and that there is no Constitutional Court declaring you unconstitutional I 'm done Madam President Minister do not ask VOX ask the Spanish people and history will you do something to prevent the coupsmen the separatists those who hate Spain and want to destroy the nation national sovereignty and the Constitution from achieving their objectives Or are you going to keep scrubbing that road map that leads us to suicide It is a pity Minister that we are here to denounce it and soon in the ballot box the Spanish people to put a stop to it Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,38.233685,14.945879,18,thank much president minister urgent inquiry vox parliamentary group asking behalf government intend prevent want destroy national

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,"Thank you very much Madam President This proposed law submitted by the VOX Parliamentary Group and which I have the honour to defend seeks to amend the Organic Law 10/1995 of the Criminal Code adding a paragraph in article 20.4 in order to ensure full exemption from criminal responsibility when action is taken in self defence I think that as in so many things in life we could give long explanations but things are better understood better understood and especially in these cases better empathized if we bring some examples I have already told you that many of you will know them but it is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of those who have had to suffer these situations and moreover to be fair when it comes to assessing what we would have done if we had found ourselves in the same situation Here 's the thing The legislators are often told that we are far from reality that laws are obsolete or that they have never come to understand the reality they seek to regulate This is one of those cases in which dramatically many Spaniards have had to go through situations that were in themselves tragic but that the law has done doubly tragic But above all and let me draw your attention to this issue tomorrow or past any of you even those who are distracted looking at the mobile phone or thinking about other things your parents grandparents or loved ones might find themselves in this very situation Then they will ask how could it have happened to me How could I be abandoned by the rule of law This has little to do with political issues of parties it has to do with issues of common sense and if I am hastened of the simplest and most plain sense of justice and equity and equal could be in Spain than in any other country Let 's talk about Jacinto's case in a municipality in Tenerife an 80 year old man Two assailants violently entered his house and beat him and his wife with heaviness They carry sharp carpenter iron forms and a gun-yes a gun which was later shown to be a simulated weapon although I wonder which one of us stands in front of an assailant who carries a gun in his hand and says Excuse me is it true or false It was a gun that made this person see that his life depended on his reaction He was able to reach a closet pull out a gun for which he had a gun license give a warning shot to the floor that was not attended by the assailants and shoot at one of them by shooting down This man Jacinto was sentenced to two and a half years for murder and had to pay 20,000 euros in fine But look in the trial itself the other assailant said to questions from the prosecution For I would have done the same as Jacinto did and by the way would not have let any assailant escape if it had been my family that was at risk Second example Pepe seventy seven years old in the municipality of Ciudad Real An assailant about thirty years old carrying a chainsaw in his hand entered his home We 're not talking about the Texas Killing movie we 're talking about a reality a man who faced a stranger in his own house with a chainsaw in his hand He managed to reach of course prisoner of panic and fear a closet in which he had a licensed hunting shotgun and managed to shoot down the assailant thus saving his life He was charged with murder and went to prison Let 's talk about another case in the Balearics Pau aged eighty two had to be assaulted in his home by four assailants with an average age of twenty five who wanted to steal from him Likewise this man who lived in the countryside after the beating that had struck him and while they were checking the house to find money or some object to steal from him managed to catch his hunting shotgun and was able to shoot down one of the assailants This man Pau was sentenced to four years in prison for murder and had to compensate the families of the assaulted assailant with more than 100,000 euros And the last example I bring you is that of a person I could personally meet with his wife in Jaen He is called Remigio and is seventy years old she is seventy eight years old Two robbers entered his house and beat them to death for which they were hospitalized for more than ten days His knees were broken with an iron bar I assure you my tears fell when they introduced me to that poor old lady with all her arms all her legs and all her bruised back They wanted to rob them but as Remigio said If we have nothing The reality is that he had a shotgun but it was such a beating that he could n't even get to the room he was in He feared for his life and feared for his wife 's life and told us that he felt pain because he believed that before her he would be killed He could n't take that gun He did not shoot or shoot any of the assailants and was therefore not prosecuted or convicted But we have no doubt that if he had been able to exercise the right to self defence had he reached the closet had he taken the weapon and had shot and shot at any of the assailants he would have been prosecuted and would have been convicted We could continue to set many other examples but there are others that I did not want to bring because unfortunately the victims of these assaults could not tell them because they could not reach the closet because they could not take a gun because they could not take a knife from the kitchen because they could not take a vase or a lamp or a shovel from the garden or any element that would have allowed them to save their life These are the cases of those who suffered assaults on their home and who died murdered at the hands of the assailants They could not exercise the right to self defence We today ask you under article 17 of the Constitution which guarantees the right to liberty and security of all Spaniards and article 18.2 which guarantees the right to inviolability of our home to defend ourselves against those who endanger our lives or that of our relatives our physical integrity or our property through trespassing or the crime of usurpation And we ask them to amend and add to the Criminal Code a paragraph in article 20.4 to ensure that there is a security right and effective and a legal presumption that any means used for the self defence of your home your family or your life must be considered automatically and by design of the law as a rational proportionate and necessary means and that therefore the exemption from any liability takes place I will finish my speech with two sentences One I said in public when I met Remigio and promised four years ago that one day we will bring this initiative to this House to this Congress of Deputies I said to him When VOX can we guarantee the exercise of the right to self defence with the legally guaranteed exemption of anyone who makes a legitimate use of any instrument with which he can defend or at least attempt to defend his life or integrity And I said to him more When VOX is in the Government of Spain not only will they not have to go through the bench they will not only not be accused but we will impose a medal on civil merit for helping us fight crime and helping to restore the rule of law I want to end with a phrase that is not mine it 's from a nefarious communist with which we had the misfortune of having to coincide which I do n't say share in these seats That communist said repeatedly Fear is going to change sides For this initiative seeks that fear changes its side and that older people who are in their homes terrified that one day they may enter someone and put their life or that of their family at risk may have the peace of mind that if the police or the Civil Guard and they have the opportunity to defend themselves they will never be accused or seated on a bench And therefore those who start to be afraid will be the assailants who will twice think of entering a house in case they may find themselves stranded or with a brave hero who with a kitchen knife in his hand will face them and do the justice that perhaps the State at that time has not been able to do Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,32.908756,9.920015,18,"thank much madam president proposed law submitted

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much Madam President In our group we have described this government on different occasions as an autocratic totalitarian despotic manipulative and illegitimate government and many are the reasons and many are the different issues We have said of him that he is a government that promotes unconstitutionality as demonstrated in the states of alarm It is also a government that promotes hatred against everyone who disagrees with it especially against members of VOX and a government that practices and promotes sectarianism for example with its laws of gender ideology and historical memorylessness and of course with climate fanaticism VOX was right when he described the government as such and VOX is right when he says that in policy of ceses also of high offices what is the norm of this government is arbitrariness whim partisan actions or decisions and of course act to the dictate of what his separatist partners tell him or feminist movements and lobbies or external chavista pressures Today we talk about the purges of Sanchez I said purges someone will have heard fleas and will get nervous and the purges of a government against two types of people The list would be endless We could first of all talk about those who are loyal to Spain those who have been purged and stopped for defending the rule of law and legality We will remember Colonel Sánchez Corbí head of the UCO of the Civil Guard with thirty five years of unspeakable struggle against ETA who denounced that there were not enough funds to carry out the operations and was overwhelmingly ceased in August 2018 We could talk about José Antonio Nieto head of the work prevention services of the National Police Corps who reported that there was a potentially deadly situation with the pandemic that was stalking Spain calling itself an alarmist and was shut down in March 2020 We could talk about Colonel Pérez de los Cobos a man who stood out for his fight against ETA and was one of the best coordinators of the state security forces and bodies against the coup d'état of October 1 2017 who did not want to give you the information that you wanted and that you asked for information that could only be given to the judge because he was investigating the 8 M and the consequences of those demonstrations on the spread of the COVID and was completely ceased in May 2020 Recently we could talk about Juan Rodríguez Poo president of the INE of the National Institute of Statistics who gave the data of the CPI and GDP which did not like the government and was completely ceased And why not let 's talk about the reason for this proposal about Paz Esteban director of the National Intelligence Center whose coup partners said it could n't be that she was investigating the coup players mobile phones by court order And now let 's talk about the purges of those who did the dirty work to Sánchez González Laya Minister of Foreign Affairs who once he did the dirty work of bringing the terrorist leader of the Frente Polisario into Spain was stopped José Luis Ábalos Minister of Transport who did the dirty work of the suitcases of Vice President Chavista Delcy Rodríguez and was completely stopped Juan Carlos Campo Minister of Justice who carried out the pardons of the coupts and after doing so was stopped and Ivan Redondo himself who maneuvered in all these ceses and tejemanes and orchestrated all these maneuvers against one and the other and was then completely stopped By the way the list goes on and we already know who 's on it Minister Marlaska after you charge and discredit the state security forces and bodies you will be the next to be purged We have tabled an amendment calling for the necessary legal reforms to be made so that it is always necessary to justify before the various committees or before the plenary any termination of a high office because that is true democracy true transparency and accountability all the rest are the totalitarian purges of a totalitarian government like that of Pedro Sánchez,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,38.018074,14.05443,18,thank much madam president group described government

#IgnacioGilLázaro,Thank you Madam President Do n't you Well look I 'll answer him yes because it turns out that last week Junqueras explicitly announced that there would be that referendum and moreover he did it by walking around recalling all the promises that Sánchez had made and that he has not fulfilled in relation to pardons embezzlement and sedition And any consequence Minister that Sanchez has agreed with convicted criminals to impunity for the crimes committed and for those for which they may commit in the future because among other things in this very House they have announced that they will do so again So get out of the way and let 's get things in place You know that this separatist referendum is a key part of the coup that Sánchez and the separatists are giving against the Constitution and its ultimate foundation which is the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation and a coup that is also being fought against the separation of powers and the rule of law sponsored and promoted by the Government and its partners exerting unprecedented verbal violence against political opposition and judges Insults threats and lies to the left of the media Fortunately before yesterday the Constitutional Court resisted the instigation in defense of the law and fundamental law of parliamentarians and therefore today you announce a new assault again in law fraud and forcing the procedure because you know that submitting to the Constitutional Court is fundamental to Sánchez for many things and among other things to be able to convene the separatist referendum in Catalonia that Junqueras demands and announces So Minister ladies and gentlemen the blow continues Faced with this VOX will continue to fight to prevent Sánchez from stealing from the Spaniards the homeland coexistence democracy and freedom and also for him to have to answer to the courts for his faults Friday first chapter Spain will win,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,36.332615,14.926358,18,thank madam president n't well look 'll answer yes turns last week junqueras explicitly announced would referendum moreover walking around recalling promises sánchez made fulfilled relation pardons embezzlement sedition consequence minister sanchez agreed convicted criminals impunity crimes committed may commit future among things house announced get way let 's get things place know separatist referendum key part coup sánchez separatists giving constitution ultimate foundation indissoluble unity spanish nation coup also fought separation powers rule law sponsored promoted government partners exerting unprecedented verbal violence political opposition judges insults threats lies left media fortunately yesterday constitutional court resisted instigation defense law fundamental law parliamentarians therefore today announce new assault law fraud forcing procedure know submitting constitutional court fundamental sánchez many things among things able convene separatist referendum catalonia junqueras demands announces minister ladies gentlemen blow continues faced vox continue fight prevent sánchez stealing spaniards homeland coexistence democracy freedom also answer courts faults friday first chapter spain win

#MaríaTeresaLópezÁlvarez,Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Mr. Marlaska look at my flap Do you recognize this shield I suppose so though seen with your unworthy like you prison politics is a lot to assume I tell you this is the emblem with the coat of arms of Prison Institutions Do you know who it belongs to My father Do you know what it means what it represents Honesty something you lack to the point of satiety And you know why you took him today To portray from this rostrum the body of Prison Institutions in the face of its disastrous denigrating and sinister prison policy administration You have the medal to the bad merit of degrading an institution as noble and as sacrificial as it is that carried out by all professionals within prisons What an infamy his and that of his secretary general Ángel Luis Ortiz who have been able to sell themselves to the devil Let 's put a record on it It is well known that since his arrival in the Ministry of the Interior concessions have been made in relation to the approach of senior prisoners to Basque prisons and the granting of discharges without the mandatory technical reports of the professionals who according to the law must carry them out We also knew that ETA 's heirs in this Chamber are their partners to count on in decisive votes and it is that to you the acts in tribute to the members of ETA do not come or go to them when those tributes to ages is the murder to the memory and recognition of the victims of terrorism and it is the murder to the memory of those who cost them their lives the unity of Spain It was a cry to voices as I say imprisoned for political support it was a cry to voices imprisoned for budgets it was and is a cry to voices that who marked and marks the times is ETA And at the height of the senselessness in the last few days your department is the object of information that does not give rise to misunderstanding that you are the creator of the greatest betrayal of Spain the victims of terrorism and penitentiary institutions when it comes to the light that a report from the Civil Guard four hundred pages no more or less shame should give you that the armed institute for which you are responsible will bring to light your betrayals of Spain It is a report where the Benemerita accesses the messages between the environment of the incarcerated ages and the government even before its constitution and that it be her secretary general who before dating you prepared the meetings with the Kubati age As has been known the procedure includes the existence of a channel of communication between ETA and posts of the General Secretariat of Penitentiary Institutions to request a prison centre and progressions of degree were the petitions addressed by senior prisoners and in view of this you can no longer deny that your agenda that the agenda of the prison policy the agenda of your ministry and the agenda of the Government is managed by a chief representing extortion blackmail threat kidnapping and death There 's no doubt anymore Mr. Marlaska your boss is ETA Moreover his is unfortunately a policy that tramples on the pain of the victims of terrorism despises their suffering and incarnates the wounds that never heal from the car bomb from the shot in the back of the neck or from that bomb pack that came home And do you know why my father stopped putting this shield on his lapel even though he never did it in his heart Because ETA threatened him for years until he was sent a bomb package thirty years ago after he was transferred from the Rosales prison in Ceuta to the Salto del Negro prison in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria Mr Marlaska here is the key question do you know why ETA was chasing you For doing just the opposite of what you are doing for enforcing within prisons the Penal Code the Prison Law and the Prison Regulations for not giving a single privilege or special treatment to criminal gang killers Of course to comply with the law one must be honest and honest and to be honest and honest had its consequences Look I bring you here some examples of what those consequences were For example this circular was moving in prisons between prisoners of age Decade of the Nineties Esteban Nieto again resorts to the hunger strike as an extreme and last means in the face of pressure from a group of officials and the head of services García de Vinuesa for the continuous changes of cell caches and integral nudes Or this other information from the Diario de Las Palmas in reference to the blackmailers hunger strikes of ETA killer prisoners The Amnesty Coordinator sends a statement and the Diario de las Palmas echoes and says The policy of sanctions and caches is a new attack by the well known torturer and head of services García de Vinuesa Or this other information this other news from the newspaper Egin in reference to a statement that is called the Association of Relatives of Basque Political Prisoners The irregular provocations and actions that the prisoners suffer are directed by a chief of services named García de Vinuesa And look I 'm going to teach you this last one although if you like I later taught you a lot more a telegram of threats a common medium then saying We demand respect for human rights Basque prisoners or charge against your conscience State guilt You will know I imagine again that security measures i.e. prison population counts records searches searches controls cell changes are regulated in Article 65 of the Prison Rules and that they are internal security measures in prisons Paragraph 2 of the resolution states that the intensity of these measures will be in line with the potential perils of the inmates to be applied particularly in the case of inmates belonging to terrorist groups organized crime or extreme danger and that of course all those threats were nothing more or less to point out to the next one to include in the long list of Spaniards to be killed by law enforcement against benefits and favors sought by criminals as are now done by those same criminals and their heirs who want to break what is the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation That 's what you have to defend the law and order Mr. Marlaska from that you should know a little bit but you 've been able to rule the business with death a business that leaves the following figures since September 2018 There were then 232 inmates of ETA in Spanish prisons 227 of whom were sentenced and 5 prisoners and about 90 of whom were classified as first degree or closed regime In three years his negotiations with the protera world leave a current record that speaks of the 180 prisoners of ETA in first degree or closed regime no one is already serving their sentence under that regime Tell me Mr. Marlaska who are you with those who die or those who kill Where is the dignity left Mr Marlaska where is the decency of a minister when he is able to negotiate his chair and that of his president with statures and proteras to improve the situation of the murderers in prisons to give them benefits that they do not deserve in the form of release or rapprochement and you leave the law in the drawers of memory Although it is not the only thing that has been left on the road you too have left honor and dignity in the carpet corridors and have exalted even more what we all knew that proteras and murderers are the appendix that marks the course of a government with little scruple and no conscience Because you know I was a little girl when I saw my father lying on the floor to look under our car when I had to give every six months a phone number other than my friends and also when our car had a different license plate every certain time and I did n't understand anything a day when an artifact broke out in prison I saw the explosion from the prison staff pavilion where we lived at 40 meters the explosive charge went up to the sky Over the years I knew that with the threat we traveled from Ceuta to the Lucky in the hope of living without bullets in the back but from them we returned with the unnegotiable package of ETA which sought a price to pay that was too high do n't you think Mr Marlaska It was life And you and your government are able to agree on prison policy in relation to the prisoners of the terrorist organization ETA with the inherited formations of those bloody criminals in exchange for violating the memory of nearly 900 murdered including the brother and nieces of my dear colleague José Alcaraz and the son of Antonio Salvá Diego But also the memory of members of their ranks Have you forgotten the balance sheet of murder victims Have you forgotten the 80 kidnappings Because 532 days had José Antonio Ortega Lara kidnapped By the way do you know what I saw when I walked in and out of the prison where we lived I 'm going to tell you a cartel demanding the release of prison officer Ortega Lara I do not forget the minutes of silence of his companions at the prison gates asking for their freedom minute of silence week after week for almost two years A little bit of crime has its partners behind their backs This Government has now implemented a pro-terrorist prison policy against what has historically been carried out by the various governments when they were implementing an anti-terrorist prison policy Your duty in politics if you were a decent minister you who have lived threatened also many years what makes you even more unworthy if it fits is not to close your agreements with ETA Because those agreements are being closed by a traitor you yourself a minister of the interior and what you should do as I say as far as prison policy is concerned is to comply with the law So what measures are you going to take to prevent ETA from ceasing to decide on Spain 's prison policy Because I remind you Mr. Marlaska that forgiving terrorists is God 's business,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,30.44259,15.210613,18,thank

#MaríaTeresaLópezÁlvarez,Minister I have to tell you what a cowardly way to defend your prison policy His speech today is the betrayal of Spain You have wanted to justify the unjustifiable and the worst is that you know it even being a judge and knowing it and even though the National Court has revoked against the decision of the Interior the release of the Íñigo Gutiérrez era a decision of you against the unanimous vote of the professionals of the prison of Aranjuez who in your report pick up the risk of the medium high incidence and who as I say voted to keep it in second degree and even though last week the Central Court of Prison Surveillance of the National Court also revoked the third degree that the General Secretariat of Prison Institutions granted to the Crespo era because the National Court concludes that the Interior you granted him semi- freedom without the prisoner meeting the requirements And they are not the only ones since the National Court revoked a few months ago also a progression of degree to a terrorist granted by the Ministry of the Interior Do you remember To Unai Fano because the National Court considered that the granting of the third degree was premature and impropriety And above all you are not able to be a decent minister a whole person and leave because you have ascended to this rostrum defending the indefensible Denying evidence makes it even more unworthy Reiterating his lies makes him even more tracer Because it is traceable laclandestinity of its policy and its ambush to Prison Institutions and its professionals in addition to handling you do the pain of the victims of terrorism and that is what you have done in your intervention I deeply regret that I have no respect for all those who lost their lives by wearing a uniform to work with by being the children of those who carried it and all those victims who were not respected by their sacred right to live Today as at the time it is very expensive to defend our homeland and the law because in the face of the third degrees granted so far and which are being revoked by the National Court thanks to the resources of the Public Prosecutor 's Office what will your State Attorney General do in March in the election of the new Chief Public Prosecutor of the National Court Will this government again yield to pressure and blackmail by not renewing the current chief prosecutor and his prison coordinator prosecutor Are they going to take reprisals against them as ETA 's heirs are already demanding them to pave the way for the release of ETA prisoners Justify this The abertzale left mobilizes against the prosecutor who stops the release of ETA prisoners Justify it But Mr Marlaska in this bis a bis between you and me one thing has become clear that you do not respect so much blood spilled in the name of Spain that you only know how to cover up your shames as a minister with miserable speeches like the one you just offered us speeches that leave you in evidence leave you in evidence your lack of humanity St. Augustine of Hippo has already said where there is no charity there can be no justice Your intervention here today at the headquarters of the national government has been the intervention of a fugitive because you have defended here today your prison policy by favoring the hands they pointed out the bloodstained hands of the bloodthirsty terrorists of ETA and you have done so by saying that you have no escape that you do not get rid of the condemnation of being the greatest traitor to the victims of terrorism to their memory to the truth and to justice I will allow myself today to finish my inquiry as I began honoring the noble body of Prison Institutions so that the Virgin of the Merced her patroness will always take care of them and protect them especially while you are at the head of the Interior and honoring the hearts of the victims of terrorism honoring the dignity of their families because they know what they are wounded that they do not age and that of course today they cannot believe that destiny was to be this to claim to the Minister of the Interior of the Government of Spain justice and dignity in the face of treason and conspiracy Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,30.762709,16.726828,18,minister tell cowardly way defend prison policy speech today betrayal spain wanted

#MaríaTeresaLópezÁlvarez,Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen In case there 's any doubt the facts Today we are going to rat out unravel and unravel Mr. Grande Marlaska 's lies from this rostrum last week He repeated to us twice that third degree progressions granted by penal institutions to different ages were based on legality judicial control and that even third degree progressions had been made by judicial decision against the criterion of penal institutions He referred specifically to terrorists José Pedro Pikabea Ugalde Juan Carlos Herrador Pouso and Antonio Troitiño He lied to the Minister of the Interior in a deceivable and deliberate manner at the parliamentary seat because indeed José Pedro Pikabea was progressed third degree in February 2019 when the central judge of Prison Surveillance estimated his appeal for reform against two resolutions of the General Secretariat of Prison Institutions but what he forgot to tell the Minister in a crooked manner is that those resolutions of the General Secretariat denying the progression to the third degree of this age were January and March 2018 that is when he ruled the People 's Party and were neither he nor his interlocutor with the representatives of the prisoners of the age Mr Angel Luis Ortiz But if the defachation with which he lied did not seem enough he came to give us another example that of the age Juan Carlos Herrador Pouso who following his road map with the heirs of ETA has moved on two occasions within a little more than a year from the prison of Ocaña I to the prison of El Dueso in Cantabria and from El Dueso to Bilbao Grand Marlaska said that it had been progressed in August 2020 by the Central Prison Surveillance Judge contrary to the general secretariat 's approach And here comes the height of indecency and its indignity because this age is not that it has not been advanced to the third degree by the central judge against the criterion of Prison Institutions but that until today it remains in second degree Thus once we have found that for the Minister of the Interior the gifts that come from justice and truth are not superior to those that originate in the conspiracy fact that we could also verify in his intervention among other calumnies Grande Marlaska said that ETA does not direct the prison policy because ETA no longer exists tell me ladies and gentlemen what does that statement have when I look at the front from here and see five ETA heirs sitting at the seat of national sovereignty which confirms what we have been saying for all time that ETA is in the institutions and that it is the government of Pedro Sánchez with his Minister of the Interior at the head that whitewashes assassins and protera to remain on the throne of indecency Look where in the end it turns out that a minister of the Interior who must ensure the legality and full compliance with the sentences imposed on the prisoners of the terrorist gang ETA is dedicated to treating with undeserved courtesy terrorist prisoners bloody criminals from the General Secretariat of Prison Institutions and it is that according to us in response to our inquiry second degree approaches and progressions occur in law enforcement and judicial control a perverse statement because both approaches and second degree progressions occur without respect for the technical reports of the treatment boards In addition the minister had to cite the impossibility of appeal by the prosecutor 's office since these are progressions which are subject to the central judge of prison supervision only by means of appeal of the prisoner and of course in the face of a progression of degree no prisoner will appeal The same applies to the transfer of prison facilities which are not judicialized without the will and appeal of the prisoner because there is no appeal by the prosecutor 's office Therefore here comes as a ring to the finger that accomplice and murderer go in the same way In the hangover of immorality in which Mr. Grande Marlaska lives permanently he rejoices in deception and also denies that there is a underground channel of communication between the Ministry of the Interior through its general secretariat and representatives of the terrorist organization ETA and its political arms as reflected in the report of the Civil Guard by all known In the same misdemeanour the same day that from this rostrum denies any preferential treatment to ETA prisoners the Public Prosecutor 's Office of the National Court resorted to the third degree progression granted by Prison Institutions to three other ETA prisoners after it revoked three third grades for improper premature or contrary to the criteria of the treatment boards He did not count the unworthy Minister of the Interior with so much stone on his way to the last end that of the release of ETA terrorists the last end of his coronation as the greatest traitor to Spain and the victims of terrorism It is clear that Mr Marlaska will not stop lying until he has completed his collection the collection of third degrees and approaches promised in exchange for the heat of phylotterrorists in the whole valley so as to finish the most desolating legislature in all history But to the dirty rags of its failure out of disloyal prison policy granting third degrees and benefits to terrorists along with the degradation to the professionals of penal institutions to which by inertia it had already abandoned combined with the permissiveness shown in the face of the celebration of acts of tribute to those condemned for terrorism and betraying the victims we must unite its inability to placate the crisis of citizen insecurity throughout Spain its disastrous management in one of the biggest migratory crises that are remembered on the Spanish coasts and also the invasion of Ceuta in May 2021 And more Mr. Marlaska 's dirty rags Among them the destabilization of our State Security Forces and Corpses and their contribution to their expulsion from the Basque Country and Navarre Anybody got any more Because I will not be denied that there are grounds for public reprobation and the immediate dismissal of Mr Grande Marlaska as Minister of the Interior which is what we urge in this motion to the Government Because it is more than well founded that the chains of slavery must be removed from Spain with terrorists before arbitrary decisions and with criteria exclusively for political support And because a

#MaríaTeresaLópezÁlvarez,Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon Here we are again the government electing Barabbas There are 379 unsolved ETA attacks This is about 50 of the murders of the bloodthirsty Etraras among them the one that cost the civilian guards Diego Salvá the son of my colleague Antonio Salvá and Carlos Sáenz de Tejada in Mallorca in 2009 Unsolved crimes That does deserve a commission of inquiry Until a few years ago they were gunshots to the back of the head car bombs kidnappings and extortion Today extortion remains part of his modus operandi The method of extortion is recorded by the comrades of these assassins on fire in this House because Bildu here in the seat of national sovereignty together with independenceists separatists and coupsmen uses a perfect machine of extortion consented to the Government that arrives to this day with this new proposal with this new initiative and brings it among other forms a screen of hatred to Spain the party whose spokesman was sentenced to prison for the exaltation of terrorism when she was editor of the protera newspaper Eguin But Bildu is not the only party that makes this request for the creation of a Commission of Inquiry This initiative also brings her Republican Left with several of her leaders condemned by the Supreme Court and therefore imprisoned for a coup d'état in the illegal referendum of October 1 2017 the party that governs a coalition executive with Junts presiding over a government in Catalonia that is a government in rebellion refusing to abide by court sentences And this initiative is also signed by Esquerra 's partners in the Catalan government the party of Laura Borrás accused of prevarication fraud misappropriation of public revenues and documentary falsity Frankly this would be enough to put an end to this debate and to announce that we refuse to support this proposal because of the lack of moral legitimacy of its proponents That 's why and because this is another one of his letters of his Machiavellian game of stone throw and disarm the State and attack and discredit the forces and security forces of the State using the institutions But since the misconceptions are numerous and act as an aggravating factor we will continue to derail more folly to support our refusal ETA has not said the places where they hide hundreds of weapons and with a lot of explosives That does deserve a commission of inquiry Cases of abuse of the girl wards in Baleares Valencia and Las Palmas abused under the institutional guardianship of the Socialist Party Podemos and Compromís This is juvenile corruption That does deserve a commission of inquiry The network is spying on children in Catalan school recesses to find out what language they speak That does deserve a commission of inquiry And you know what a commission of inquiry deserves The heinous strategy of the Minister of the Interior to bring terrorist prisoners closer to Basque prisons authorizing in these years up to 345 transfers in favor of two hundred years that killed almost three hundred people As I say that does deserve a commission of inquiry And when the government gave up prisoners for budgets when the government is able to discredit the National Intelligence Corps we the VOX Parliamentary Group would like to know in exchange what the support of the Socialist Group which through an amendment is already positioned to support this Commission of Inquiry because we already know that this government is only being blackmailed by terrorists independenceists separatists and coups Today with this request from the Commission of Inquiry and its defence for those parties that embody hatred of everything that sounds Spanish we are witnessing a real deterioration of politics and institutional destabilization that we have come to repair in VOX To finish two messages Mr President ladies and gentlemen you should seriously consider whether the best thing you can do is get out of the way Their lack of legitimacy and their own dirty rags have left them at zero in their own request for the Commission of Inquiry Overcome failure you have devoured yourselves And ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Group stop arming those who want to destroy our homeland stop turning themselves in to the enemies of Spain stop being the necessary co-operators of terrorists and coups to

#VíctorGonzálezCoelloDePortugal,With all due respect Madam President His lordship of Bildu asked if anyone knew what the resignation or termination of CNI director Paz Esteban was due to I think all of Spain knows the reasons The reasons were you Mr de Esquerra and Mr de PNV who have taken over the government where you want it At least they had the dignity as you have rightly pointed out to cease with all the dignity that is owed to them You asked a question and I also ask you do you know ladies and gentlemen of Bildu who are the material perpetrators of the 379 unresolved ETA crimes Do you know ladies and gentlemen of Bildu who are the material perpetrators of 40 of the unsolved murders of ETA Do you know ladies and gentlemen of Bildu why there are still attacks on people civil guards children of politicians or civilians who do not think the same as you do in the Basque Country and Navarre Do you know ladies and gentlemen of Bildu why the ETA butchers continue to be honoured CNI 's mission is to work to protect Spanish society that puts it on its website I 'm sure they 've read it trying to anticipate threats to Spanish society gathering information and turning it into intelligence The PNV asks us to amend two laws Law 11/2002 and Organic Law 2/2002 of 6 May regulating the prior judicial control of the National Intelligence Centre On the one hand what they want is greater judicial control but they do n't want greater judicial control for a reason but what they want is to bring it to inoperative so that it 's not operational They want there to be three judges as the spokesman for Citizens has explained very well before three judges one from the PNV one from the PSOE and one from Podemos Or not Like the control they want from the judiciary That is what you would like and therefore not to be operational Besides they want to know the means employed I was surprised that you did not come here to talk about how intelligence services work in other neighbouring nations of ours as you have done on other occasions and that you did not make a comparison to see if what is in Spain is more or less Look this initiative is from the month of May One might think that the slow moving coup d'état being led by the Sánchez government had already been aligned with their wishes since May How curious that they present it now when we 're watching the assault on the judiciary I believe that what you are asking is not balanced It is not balanced in our region and is outside the usual customs and customs in any criminal case as it has already been exposed and therefore I will not stop at it Then they want political control They want the president to appoint a secretary of state who is responsible to be able to ask for responsibilities from someone who owes you to be in the government while the logical thing would be that there were professionals in an agency that is to defend Spain and to defend Spanish society professionals who were not in the political arena You want more political control we want more technicians at the service of Spain Therefore the initiative presented by his group the Basque Parliamentary Group seeks to weaken the National Intelligence Centre and is imbued with partisan and spurious interests Thus it seeks to amend article 6.2 of Law 11/2002 This fact is very enlightening as it contains the same wording that the Government gave to the same paragraph in the second final provision of Royal Decree Law 8/2020 of 17 March which was declared unconstitutional by Judgment 110/2021 of 13 May of the Constitutional Court So it 's not that you 're worried about justice it 's not that you 're worried about the security of Spain you 're worried about what the CNI can investigate you 're worried about them being able to investigate the more than twenty cases of corruption in which the PNV or former PNV agents are involved which is logical when someone has been ruling for so long He said someone

#CarlosJoséZambranoGarcíaRáez,"With all due respect Madam President Ladies and gentlemen the analysis of this section shows in particular that these ruin budgets are a disaster that has no possible arrangement and that only an amendment to the whole and a return to the government would be made Today groups which have tabled amendments to the joint text add up to their thousands of vetoes and none of them complain but the sectarianism of this Government is total it has proved it over and over again I do not know what answer this Government expects Ladies and gentlemen this government wants us all to participate in a paripé when in reality these budgets are already tied and cooked between socialists communists separatists and heirs of the ETA environment Today the news is known that the Government has surrendered to Bildu and will remove the Civil Guard from the Navarra roads To that a few minutes ago a spokesman for the Socialist Party called it institutional normality These budgets are the result of undesirable pacts for personal and party interests What interests Don Pedro Sánchez 's interest in staying in his chair the interest of the deputies of these groups who support him and his political clientele in order to continue living from the harshness of public money the interest of separatist coupism in avoiding the sentences handed down by the courts In short these budgets of ruin are the result of dealings between the left and the separatists who will end up paying the Spanish with their freedom and economy But let 's look at some points of interest in this section in these few minutes Unemployment By 2022 the general budgets expected that gross domestic product would grow by 6 and a budget of more than EUR 22.4 billion for unemployment was envisaged for SEPE Well we 're going to end up growing in 2022 instead of the 6 that was estimated a maximum of 2 after the slowdown of the economy in the third quarter Now the budgets for the year 2023 have been achieved with an estimated growth of 2.1 when we already know that we are going to decrease in the first two quarters and even in the third If we do not grow by more than 2 we know that jobs are being destroyed in the country However with an economy growing less than in 2022 unemployment is expected to fall by 5.3 There are 1179 million less budgeted and let us also remember that we have 920 000 fixed breaks which although they do not count in unemployment statistics do count for unemployment benefits In short the Socialist Government removes money from unemployment knowing that it will need it later through transfers appearing a false reality and hiding the real needs of unemployment expenditure With regard to self employment the Government had had no choice but to recognize in the budgets that there would be a serious fall in self employment With the self employed they do the opposite and the programme of economic benefits for the cessation of activity of self employed workers increases by 207 Already the amount budgeted in the previous year was such that it required subsequent transfers to try to reach all claimants In short it is recognized by the Government of the nation that it is going to be a very tough year for a column as fundamental to the national economy as the autonomous are And to this we add the treatment to young people young people are abandoned While Spain leads the highest youth unemployment rate in the European Union the OECD or the euro area money invested in youth employability will be lower the Youth Employment Programme will be cut by 39 and the Digital Skills for Youth Employment and Employment Promotion Programme will be abolished In short they are budgets that in this section show a clear sectarianism and a clear clientelism There is a 15 increase in advisory expenditure to the Government in social economic and labour matters more expenditure on advisers even more so when we have almost 3 million unemployed in Spain in addition to the 920,000 discontinuous workers who are ultimately temporary workers The costs for trade unions and employers of course and the transfer of real estate to these bodies do not fall they are EUR 40 million intended among other things to keep trade unions quiet Meanwhile funds are allocated to ideological programmes disguised as green transformation or support to LGTB collectives In short more political clientelism International bodies no longer hide that if the European economy goes into recession Spain will suffer the worst consequences These budgets are based on wrong estimates They are a disguise that seeks to hide harmful management and truly undesirable pacts and as we have already said in relation to the Employment Act this Ministry of Labour and Social Economy actually remains as the mere ministry of unemployment It is no more than that a ministry of unemployment because this government has already given up developing policies for the creation of stable and quality jobs and it only remains to manage and above all to make up the figures of chronic unemployment and of a labour market that increasingly offers worse conditions to workers in Spain These ruin budgets are an instrument of more than one illegitimate Government for perpetuating itself in power From VOX we commit ourselves to rebuilding everything that this government destroys and call on the unity of all Spaniards to regain the freedom and prosperity of the nation Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,34.2815,13.980554,18,"due respect madam president ladies gentlemen analysis

#CarlosJoséZambranoGarcíaRáez,With venial Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen Eurojust is indeed an agency that allows us to fight effectively against organised cross border crime and every time its results are analysed its usefulness becomes more evident The recent Eurojust reports and the European Parliament 's last budgetary control report show us their intense activity I would like to make it clear to you that from such reports there is a great deal of emphasis on the mention of the fight against criminal illegal immigrant trafficking organizations It is a matter that not only concerns us with the security of our streets and the exploitation and risk of vulnerable people because already in 2015 Eurojust warned us of the entry of radical Islamists through these Mafia networks To suppress these illegal immigration mafias in recent years Eurojust 's operations have been greatly intensified and some of them with detainees in Spain In this regard it is curious that in 2016 the PSOE strongly criticized the then government for the lack of police action he said in Spain against this type of mafia and however on questions from the VOX Group the government has acknowledged that during this socialist government the number of organizations and of this type of mafia operating in Spain has doubled This demonstrates the inconsistency of the socialist government and that we should not just adapt this regulation to Spanish legislation but should be providing the police with means and abandoning these policies with so called effect that these mafias are so much profited by Secondly I would like to mention that the text that is being produced today envisages that both the Spanish national member and deputy and assistant in Eurojust will be members of the judicial or prosecutorial career We believe that they are the best possible professionals for these types of posts and we cannot agree with the amendment by Citizens which opens the door to the integration of other types of officials We have magnificent judges and prosecutors and although political power has been mistreating both the judicial and fiscal careers by pressing for their political control appointing a socialist minister as a prosecutor general doing everything possible in the end to control politically the organs of the judiciary despite all this judges and prosecutors have remained loyal to their duty and spare no effort in law enforcement Without doubt they are the ones who can offer us the best guarantees of professionalism and effectiveness Finally I believe that this law will be adopted with the virtually unanimous support of the House When this happens it is customary to hear from the Government or the Socialist Group some self praising for consensus in the vote Indeed it has already happened in some other initiative that a majority vote is used by the Government to appear to the gallery a certain will towards political consensus But let us not be fooled this type of technical legislation is supported by common sense and not by consensus and this Government however much it says or presumes does not know what consensus is This Government and the political groups that support it from what they do know are political marketing which is very different from consensus They have left us with evidence over and over again because consensus is not to exchange pardons for coup criminals in exchange for parliamentary support that is political marketing Consensus is not to water a communist ministry with millions of euros from all Spaniards to keep a few more months in power Nor is it consensus to promise to reform the charter the crime of sedition or the division of members of the General Council of the Judiciary between political groups or to look elsewhere while the law is being breached in Catalonia or to access absurd laws that run counter to common sense all in exchange for power to remain in power That 's not consensus that 's marketing that 's deal We do n't have rulers we have traffickers There is consensus when different groups direct their talks towards the general interest for the good of Spain not when the purpose is the personal interest the partyist the power for power and the regret of this political marketing in which the Government has settled the Spanish end up paying for it with their freedom and economy Thank

#VíctorManuelSánchezDelReal,Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen this motion is understood very quickly by reading what the representatives of ERC have already said in the inquiry into which this motion is born The Republican Parliamentary Group agreed with its group the PSOE to withdraw the amendment to the entire 2022 General Budgets in exchange for the General Audiovisual Communication Act being negotiated and approved with the ERC independents This is blackmail This is another step in the ongoing and permanent blackmail of independence for all Spaniards And in this case with hostages the sector of independent production and the freedom of expression of the Spaniards on social networks where they manage to accumulate a little audience that disposes of the nerves to you to you and to the usual Those are the ones you have kidnapped and that is blackmail Because you and you PP and PSOE were portrayed in the famous law Because you want the duopoly the duopoly that 's got you caught up in the news And you the ERCs and the Independenceists want the tripoly What you want is a monopoly moreover local in your territory with the excuse of languages So do n't come here and defend the independent producers You only defend indepes producers which is a very different thing It 's a little painful it's a little painful because you 're still fooled by the tahur It is already very painful it is that they have already failed them in the Commission it is that they have failed them in the presentation it is that they have lied here in the parliamentary debate it is that they have lied to them in the Senate and here they come to crawl before Pedro Sánchez to say what about me Pedro give me the argo He 's not gonna give it to them What I should give them is shame Look if you 're gonna be blackmailers learn from the good guys The PNV can give you lessons which also support you with general state budgets that two days later stab you as Mr Rajoy knows Stabbed as the day after day by the duopoly of Atresmedia and Mediaset to the People 's Party who gives himself timid and handed himself over to that duopoly that he created and that he continues to be afraid of because he 's been caught up in the news and you 'll know what the news is Because these are the same producers who are going to make the sauna massage series to his holiness the same producers who also charge from Spanish Television They are the same ones that you have supported from the PP from the PSOE and those that you want to have exclusively in your territories which you intend to dominate Who pays for the duck Because what you put into that law is the limitation of the freedom of expression of Spanish people on social networks That 's what you you and you all together managed to get into that law But no one talked about it because we were left alone Look we have to defend freedom we have to avoid duopoly we have to eliminate the tripoly and monopoly that you want to have in your territories that you consider your own and above all we have to stop once and for all the propaganda of you of you and territorially of you that we pay all the Spaniards We 've got to get rid of that propaganda now That is why the VOX Parliamentary Group will now demand full and absolute transparency so that the Spanish know how much public money they receive from governments Let them declare let them be transparent and that when we open a newspaper let us watch a television or let us see a series let us know how much money you you or you have given them And above all I can tell you one thing Someday there will be a government with sufficient dignity and in that government there will be VOX or VOX will support it to repeal this audiovisual law which is all it does is hand over complete control of information and entertainment to the usual the duopoly and the indepe triopoly Someday we will repeal that law for that reason for the freedom of all Spaniards to receive information and entertainment free and created by independent producers And we will also repeal it because it goes against the freedom of those who manage to get some attention on social networks Because you 're already going against influencers against tickets or youtubers You know why Because they are not controlled by the duopoly because they are not controlled by the political duopoly nor by the media duopoly nor by the independenceist monopoly of blackmail and extortion Let the extortion end and let the freedom of expression of the Spaniards

#CarlaToscanoDeBalbín,With the venom With this proposed law a case is added to article 177 bis of the Criminal Code to make penalties worse for cases where the victim is a vulnerable person due to armed conflict or a humanitarian catastrophe Firstly we welcome the change in the scope of law enforcement It would be absurd to circumscribe this worsening of the penalty only to the victims of the war in Ukraine as was originally thought although as an initiative of the PSOE it would not have been rare to see them make a proposal in which justice and equality will shine through their absence and there would be first and second victims as we are already accustomed to gender laws Massive population displacements are often carried out in armed conflict or humanitarian catastrophes The instability caused by war makes it possible for human traffickers to take advantage of the vulnerability of those who suffer from it In particular trafficking in persons is rightly referred to as the slavery of the twenty first century because this crime violates a number of fundamental rights such as physical integrity psychological integrity freedom and dignity Victims of trafficking are held in slavery by force coercion or intimidation and are lied to about work living conditions travel and their legal future They are displaced by traffickers from one place to another so that they are isolated and coerced and blackmailed so that they do not report They live hell in life of threats and fear Their lives are marked by the abuse the violation of their human rights and the control of their traffickers For all this we consider it essential to tighten the penalties for those guilty of trafficking just as it is essential that we put all the means at our disposal to detect these situations For this it is necessary to make visible that word that you like so much the reality of trafficking to make visible all victims because they are all equally important On the one hand we have the victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation the only or most commonly spoken of Why Because most of the victims are women because they are the victims that best suit their causes Therefore they keep bragging about the Road Plan their new plan to in theory give economic labour and social alternatives to trafficked women for the purpose of sexual exploitation A Road Plan by the way with 204 million euros But what is behind this plan and this sudden interest in human trafficking I believe that it is necessary for the Spaniards to know that the Road Plan aims to give privileged treatment to the women alleged victims of trafficking without complaint and therefore without sentences They want to reward victims of trafficking without sentences with massive regularizations and give them an administrative accreditation document proving their status as victims of trafficking without a sentence Ladies and gentlemen of the PSOE this music sounds to me it has a melody very similar to the comprehensive law against gender based violence feminism always simulating concern for women although they really do not care about anything or anyone as we have seen these days in a bloody way they may want to make another collage of false complaints and self reported victims And it is not a question of not having to deal with these victims of course because in addition to their lack of freedom we have to deal with the very harsh circumstances in which they live sexually transmitted diseases sexual abuse rape forced abortion post abortion syndrome but always from rigour and legal certainty But there are other victims of trafficking victims of labour exploitation who must also be made visible It is many men who suffer it also women and children especially in the fields of agriculture construction clandestine workshops hospitality and who as victims of trafficking as well as lack of freedom suffer major health problems injuries and chronic pain due to the harsh conditions under which they are forced to work By the way this type of trafficking is closely linked to illegal immigration which you promote by allowing the violation of our borders in a systematic manner Maybe that 's why we heard less about this kind of trafficking And let us not forget the children the most vulnerable victims who because of the trafficking they are victims of sexual and labour exploitation suffer from depression anxiety sexual disorders injuries malnutrition problems that a child should never live or know You gentlemen of the PSOE seemingly very concerned about all these people bring here this proposal of law which as I have said we support but I have to tell you it is very surprising that you with this proposal want to fight against trafficking against the sexual exploitation of women you who have spent so much money on prostitutes from the Andalusian unemployed How many of those prostitutes would n't be trafficked You today call for tougher penalties to protect trafficked women but refuse to harden penalties to protect women from recidivist murderers and rapists Today you tear clothes with human trafficking while practicing an open border policy and giving free access to the mafias and organizations that trade with people Pure incoherence ladies and gentlemen and this time they go like headless chicken but with pure carambola they have made it right We reiterate our support for this initiative because our position is very consistent and very simple VOX is always in favour of toughening penalties for criminals and is always on the side of vulnerable people There you will always have us to help the victims and give them everything they need to alleviate their suffering and make their lives happier and fuller We believe that trafficking in all its forms slavery and prostitution offend human dignity Trafficking in persons corrupts our civilization and dishonours those who practice it not those who suffer their injustice Therefore we hope that this toughening of the penalties for trafficking will apply to everyone equally without distinction of sex without sectarianism or ideological burdens in any direction All the victims deserve us to be legislators with capitals and that means that we legislate in the search for good according to the law,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,27.242949,11.443317,18,venom proposed law case added article 177 bis criminal code make penalties worse cases victim vulnerable person due armed conflict

#CarlaToscanoDeBalbín,With the venom Today we are here to claim the equality of all Spaniards and the ill treated article 14 of the Constitution We could talk about a negligent inequality such as that caused by the different laws of the autonomous communities or the inequality that will cause the worst law of education of our democracy or that caused by the rise of light but in VOX today we want to denounce the inequality caused painfully that which is created with full conscience with a plan and the plan is nothing other than collective alienation to under the false flag of human rights trample them and abuse them And how many abuses are being committed in the name of equality ladies and gentlemen How many abuses and how much pain is causing the desecration of this word And I speak of pain because today VOX is here to give voice to all the Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of their gender laws some laws that are the origin of inequality and the abuse of fundamental rights VOX is in this rostrum to give voice to all those parents who being innocent cannot see their children or who have to see them at a meeting point under permanent suspicion to all those men who spend nights in the dungeon because the system its system takes away the presumption of innocence It is also to give voice to all those who suffer domestic violence while being ignored and unprotected by their single track ideological laws and to all women who are assaulted and see how their aggressor gets out of jail while the Government spends the resources that should be for them in chiringuitos VOX is in this rostrum to give voice to the women and homosexuals who want to escape from their straitjacket from the totalitarian corset you have imposed on them and to give voice to the children who were not born and who from heaven wonder why they did not respect their right to live by having a disease or to arrive at a difficult time for their mothers These are their victims victims of their twisted and perverse concept of equality victims of the Comprehensive Act against Degenerate Violence the Trans Act the LGTBI Act the Abortion Act the Equal Treatment Act and all their gender laws The Ministry of Equality that hatred macrochiringuito is responsible for these tragedies but it is not the only one alongside it we have the People 's Party an accomplice always necessary and servile who pointed to the feminist and globalist car years ago and who does not dare to go down And we have all the other parties in the parliamentary arch that seem not to realize that supporting these laws are putting the rope around their necks Equality they say yes but while calling for equality they promote a law against gender based violence that criminalizes men and privileges women They demand equality for women without knowing what women are but if the woman who suffers violence is a VOX woman they shut up They demand equality but if a white man is accused of violence they destroy him without evidence if the aggressor or alleged aggressor is an immigrant they shut up They demand equality but if you 're from the LGTB collective privileges and positions They demand equality but if you criticize a left wing woman it is political violence if you criticize or insult VOX women then we deserve it by the sidelines They demand equality but if the abuser or manipulater of children is the father it is vicarious violence if the abuser or manipulater of children is a woman then even we are forbidden to speak of parental alienation They demand equality but if you have a disability it 's legitimate to abort you Do n't fool us ladies and gentlemen that we are few and we know each other a lot None of his laws have improved anyone 's life Therefore to the question posed by this great priestess of inequality and hatred the ineffable Irene Montero on what VOX proposes we answer without complexes We propose equality of truth which involves treating the person with full honesty according to what it truly is not according to what we are interested in We propose a law that protects all victims of violence without discrimination on grounds of sex age or sexual orientation We propose that the aid should be intended for the victims not for chiringuitos We propose that all the weight of the law should fall on those who attack be men or women We propose a firm control of our borders so that no one who does not respect our rights and our way of life remains among us And we call for the defence of fundamental rights from the presumption of innocence to the right to life VOX is the only party that really believes that we are all equal equal in dignity and therefore in rights But to say this is scandalous for your totalitarian thinking because as Hannah Arendt said you totalitarians do not want people to distinguish between reality and fiction between the true and the false And here the false is your supposed struggle for equality and the real thing is that that word is used by you as a gross excuse for the destruction of the person and the family And this is what underlies the gender ideology We propose good life freedom equality justice They are values of natural law and therefore universal applicable to every man and at all times Any legal system that ignores or violates these principles is trying to cossify and denigrate man to turn him into goods subject to sale of constructions and denaturalizations But of course that new man who does n't even know who he is is a much easier product to manipulate for you We will not remain indifferent to the injustice and inequality caused by this ideology and the laws it produces to the fruit that they generate of hatred pain and destruction because in VOX when we talk about equality we talk about the obligation that politicians have to guarantee respect for the dignity of every human being because only by respecting that dignity will the happiness of each and every one of us be possible But of course the premise of all this is to believe that every man deserves that happiness And it seems that after all it imposes the terrible reality that you only want the happiness of a few yours us that of all,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,28.855103,13.114822,18,venom today claim equality spaniards ill treated article 14 constitution could talk negligent inequality caused different laws

#JoaquínRoblesLópez,Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen the Royal Decree regulating the ESO curriculum has been published today The first news we have had according to an ABC publication of your impact memory is that you have rejected the request made to you by the Directorate General of Support for Victims of Terrorism to study terrorism as one more issue within the area of Geography and History They have also been against the proposal of the Ministry of Defence which proposed adding the Civic and Ethical Education collection the Culture and National Security collection However they have listened to Mrs Montero tan feminist who has asked them to censor the musical compositions I read textually which could contain components relating to the myths of romantic love in which a differential and complementary conception of men and women is assumed I mean at this point the bowlers are going to turn out to be part of the song protesting against the system with these things that you have But it is that moreover in this curriculum you say that you are going to remove the chronological sense of history Minister if history is taken away from you the chronology is no longer history it will be something else that is indoctrination which is what you claim pure and hard indoctrination And I do n't tell you the Spanish Royal Academy of History tells you which accuses you in its opinion of presentism and of using history to publicize your famous memory which you now call democratic because it seems that those leaders of the Popular Front were fighting for democracy when there is nothing more to see than their declarations to know that what they intended to do was to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat you put yourselves as you put yourselves on But it is that moreover you have skipped a unanimous agreement that there was here in this House in 2018 to include Philosophy in Compulsory Secondary Education you have replaced it with this Education for Citizenship 2.0 which as I say is pure indoctrination The historical perspective you change from a gender perspective Look you 're going to allow me a galeate tour because I know where I 'm going to come from that if homophobia that if machism that if and what Look we are opposed to gender theory for the same reasons and the same reasons why we are opposed to explaining in Secondary the nigromancy voodoo or any scientific theory such as phrenology etc. because it lacks a scientific basis Moreover the arguments against this theory I do not give them if you want Mrs Montero has gone I give you the arguments of classical feminists of the PSOE and of the United Left like Mrs Amelia Valcárcel who has just extended a published book called Nobody is born in a wrong body Mr Errasti and Mr Marino Pérez And also Mrs. Lidia Falcon founder of the Spanish Feminist Party who says the following Gender theory is a fantasy fiction an ideological roughness And Mrs Falcon describes the trans lobby not me as a mutant sect And then before the Prosecutor 's Office and topped by feminist activists she said that this trans lobby pretends she says they are her statements campaigning for paedophilia she intends to medicate Spanish students with puberty blockers hormones and other medications And he says that the ultimate purpose of these gender laws is to make women invisible He believes that gender laws are the greatest attack on women in the last 50 years and they allow a gentleman swimmer who is not even among the three hundred best swimmers to declare himself a woman to beat all the cuts and to cut all the podiums because you will be able to hide everything you want with your genres but you cannot hide sexual dimorphism that is scientific evidence Here Mr Echenique was speaking this morning about the scientific consensus with climate change With what there is a scientific consensus is with chromosomes and with the result of that chromosomal division which is sexual dimorphism And you 're gonna load up the women 's sport you 're gonna load up the women 's sport with these gender theories that go all over each other Another block as Mr Errejón another radiating nucleus would say of ideology is its climate fanaticism which includes everywhere in the agenda and in the curriculum of Secondary And understand me well we would find it wonderful that the phenomenon of climate change will be dealt with from scientific coordinates that it be explained for example in Chemistry what are the greenhouse gases and that not only carbon dioxide should be said because water vapor is the most important factor And I do n't think you guys should put an ecotase on those who cook I am convinced that it would be great to explain in mathematics how these statistical calculations are made these statistical models of climate change how temperatures are obtained the different climatic phases of the planet All this would be great but you do n't do that You want to form activists on the Greta you want to have an army of individuals who are only dedicated to repeating their mantras their ideological mantras which are ruining our primary sector and our energy sector In addition you have done something rather curious and I 'm already going to the Bachelor 's curricula we 'll talk about this already we 'll have more time to talk about it you 'll allow me with the History of Philosophy agenda I have been a professor of History of Philosophy for thirty years and it turns out that you have gone in the haystack to look for a needle that does not exist and have found it so as to give a feminist bias to the History of Philosophy They put us at Plato 's and Aristotle 's aspasia of Miletus Surely everyone knows Miletus Aspasia philosophical Hispanism is well known They place at the height of Plato and Aristotle a lady who was dedicated to rhetoric and who apparently according to some sources also 2 They place it at the height of Plato and Aristotle But we go to the Middle Ages and there they put poor Saint Hildegard a Benedictine nun who dedicated herself to natural history not philosophy Natural history is the way in which natural sciences were called at that time that is a bit of botany a bit of geology What does this lady who at best could say that she is theologist in a curriculum of History of Philosophy paint Why By their chromosomes Those that apparently do n't exist according to gender theory You 'll tell me cause let 's see what he looks like there It will not be because of your feminism because come on you tell me that a Benedictine nun is a defender of feminism for up to that point we have arrived In the Illustration you also put two perfect strangers Mrs. Olimpia de Gouges or Mary Wollstonecraft very famous because you went to France to see how they guillotined poor Marie Antonieta That 's all We do n't know anything It is true that the French made a text called Vondication of the rights of men and Vondication of the rights of women where by the way she defends virginity that is a feminist for this lady too It 's amazing But absurdity comes in the Modern and Contemporary Philosophy where you place next to Carlos Marx no less than Hannah Arendt a fierce anticommunist They put her next to Carlos Marx Man you could have put Rosa Luxemburg even if it were Well no sir Hannah Arendt a defender of pluralism and democracy and they put her next to Carlos Marx And to finish the matter in the Contemporary Philosophy you forget the father of phenomenology of Edmund Husserl you forget Bertrand Russell and all his contribution to the logic and theory of science you forget Gustavo Well the father of philosophical materialism you forget Unamuno and you put us to the testist Maria Zambrano who by the way was also dedicated to the phenomenology of religious fact Another feminist And they also put Simone de Beauvoir there but they do n't put us in their partner Jean Paul Sartre It 's amazing What is the criterion for deciding the authors of the History of Philosophy What 's in your crotch Is that the criterion Come on it 's just amazing From a philosophical point of view it is inadmissible for you to make this trap to sneak up in the morning here to non-partisan characters 2 Words withdrawn by the Presidency in accordance with Rule 104.3 of the Rules of Procedure of the House See page 110 of the history of philosophy and whose contribution to the history of philosophy is as irrelevant as that of Minister Iceta to the classical ballet And finally mathematics You have eliminated the rule of three in Primary you have eliminated the Roman numerals but it is that in the ESO and in the Baccalaureate you have eliminated the theorem of the breast and the theorem of the cosine It must be that the breast has no gender perspective They 've eliminated Cramer 's theorem Bolzano 's theorem they 've delayed the study of equation systems This is said by a professor a doctor in Mathematics Carlos Madrid in an interview with the national newspaper You 've removed the algorithms In other words it seems that the gender perspective consists in lowering the content to make mathematics perhaps more attractive I remembered Euclid 's anecdote Euclid wrote his geometry elements because Pharaoh Ptolemy asked him to do so I wanted to learn the man When Euclid gave him those elements of geometry Pharaoh did not understand anything and asked him to do something more digestible something let 's say with Pharaoh 's perspective to understand it but Euclid said to him Majesty there are no real ways to learn geometry I mean there are no smooth roads plains no hindrances on which Pharaoh walked with his chariot There are no real ways to learn geometry nor to learn physics nor to learn mathematics nor philosophy nor history The only real path is the effort the study the discipline that with what you want to end with your general approval with your elimination of numerical notes etc. favoring those who can afford a private education and harming the Spanish people who are forced to eat that ideological papilla that you provide them That 's what public education leads to but do n't worry about it because this will change There is already a political party that promises that if it comes to power and it will be sooner than later it will put all Spanish students on an equal footing studying the same according to any model they study and with no prospect of being Basque Catalan Andalusian or Murcian All the same all the same all according to their merit and ability Madam Minister what you have just done is an attack on public education no matter how much you say you defend it Thank you very

#AlbertoAsartaCuevas,"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the current Spanish foreign policy is in a deep crisis because of its improvisation and lack of direction In his appearance last week the minister told us of successes during his term but he was left with pride and let go of humility to recognize the errors of silence that have been made during this time A paradigmatic example of this improvised policy at the service of Sánchez is found in the letter sent to Mohamed VI published by the Royal Moroccan House on 14 March which modified Spain 's historical position on the Sahara avoiding as you know any prior consultation with the king and his own government and what is more serious avoiding any parliamentary debate which is not acceptable In addition it has given rise to all kinds of speculation related to the Pegasus affair and the theft of information from Sánchez 's phone because no one in this House no one finds any other reason for this change unless it is a personal decision of the president which is equally unacceptable Foreign policy is a policy of state and therefore of consensus with the rest of the political forces especially with the main opposition parties so Sánchez cannot and should not act as head of state because he simply is not If humans are making mistakes fools are persevering in error and this is what the president did on April 7 three weeks later when he travelled to Morocco and signed a joint statement in which moreover there is not a single word about the Spanishness of Ceuta and Melilla and of the Spanish sovereignty islands and pawns to the north of Africa This is where the weakness of this social communist government is clearly perceived once again On the contrary the Moroccan Government persists in its aggressive assertive policy with its claims of sovereignty over these territories Morocco qualifies Ceuta and Melilla as usurped cities which it considers together with the islands and peñones the last colonies in Africa The Kingdom of Morocco has its permanent interests clear while our Government is banditling in its relations with that kingdom and agreeing that it is this country that marks the road map according to its interests and in whatever way it may be Ladies and gentlemen the Maghreb has tried to dress one saint by undressing another a lack of political touch that has led us to have Algeria suspend the Treaty of Friendship and review its trade relations with Spain especially those related to the supply of gas something which is not a reality at this time of energy crisis For lack of time today I will not talk about Europe in which we are no longer among the best nor about Ibero America where we have lost influence The motion that the PP brings us today is like a letter to the Magi with a fifteen point petitum that we will vote one by one ten of them being more defense than outside although some of them deserve a comment Point 2 calls for NATO 's new strategic concept to provide for the protection of the entire national territory with particular attention to non- peninsular territories Ladies and gentlemen of the PP welcome to the postulates of VOX although we would have liked to request the amendment of Article 6 of the Treaty to explicitly include the cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the islands and pawns of Spanish sovereignty to the North of Africa something proposed by our group repeatedly and we therefore tabled an amendment to this point as well as three other amendments to points 6 and 7 concerning the maintenance of materials and defence budgets Point 14 refers to the threats to freedom emanating from totalitarian communist cut movements in Hispano America to which we are also submitting another amendment and we hope that all of them will be taken into account by the People 's Group Point 13 calls for the resumption of the political economic and commercial relationship with Algeria thereby restoring the position of active neutrality with regard to the future of Sahara prior to the famous letter of 14 March This point seems of vital importance to us since not only does Morocco apply the strategy of immigration blackmail to us but Algeria given the results of our new relationship with Morocco has done the same by allowing the departure of more than one hundred irregular and illegal immigrants who arrived to the Balearic Islands on board six pateras last June 8th it seems that as a warning and retaliation for the declarations made by Sánchez in this Congress on the same day on June 8th when he reaffirmed himself in his bandage with regard to the Sahara Ladies and gentlemen I conclude with a reflection that has to make us think seriously More than 2,000 immigrants attempted the assault on the Melilla fence last Friday with a terrible record of dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded among them our civilian guards Scary images of an invasion that according to Sánchez has been well resolved by Morocco What a lack of empathy for the autocrat These misfortunes and the attack on our security and sovereignty are the consequences of the migration policies of this government",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,38.90562,16.435041,18,"thank president ladies gentlemen current spanish foreign policy deep crisis improvisation lack direction appearance last week

#EduardoLuisRuizNavarro,Good morning ladies and gentlemen This draft organic law whose adoption we are discussing today is intended to transpose a European directive of 2019 1153 the aim of which is within a context of judicial and police cooperation to allow certain authorities and officials access to and exchange of information of a financial nature in order to make possible the prevention detection investigation and prosecution on European soil of a number of serious crimes being one of the most important to combat those linked to terrorism and its financing and this is expressly mentioned Terrorism on European soil is today particularly linked to Islam although consensus is progressing and of course this government and you Minister too deliberately conceal it from us because you think it is a small detail And they hide it from us so that it is not evident what millions of Europeans had the opportunity to witness in May in Saint Denis Paris that the multicultural experiment that you have introduced in some neighborhoods of our cities has turned them into outlaws of religious fanaticism hatred and crime Directed against whom Minister Against ourselves against our women against whom we have welcomed them with stupid generosity while you were singing your promises of an inclusive socialist paradise It is clear that socialism in any version of it is the opium of the people And the reality progressive ladies and gentlemen is that with their foolish policies these neighborhoods now house caves of terrorists and other criminals from where money is collected and soldiers are recruited to attack us in our own land Hence the desirability of having tools such as the one introduced by this European directive to allow the cooperation of authorities and officials to trace sources of financing for serious crimes such as terrorism But of course if our authorities and officials discover with the financial title file or with any other instrument that uses a money gathering focus in one of those multicultural neighborhoods also known as no go zone how are they going to get to the criminals You Minister surely know what kind reception our police receive when they dare to enter some of those areas Look I 'll show you News from El Faro de Ceuta April of this year The National Police intervenes a assault rifle in the Prince 's district in Ceuta This is how they receive the National Police in the Prince 's neighborhood this morning Men and adults receive the local police stoned in Prince Alfonso's neighborhood The Prince the neighborhood where basic community services are to be provided should be escorted by police And this is happening in Ceuta Spain Minister And this is the model of coexistence to be exported all over the world as some Member said here two days ago What is here is a lot of ignorance about the reality of the Islamic world If you want to know I 'm going to give you three names to find out you can Google them Asia Bibi Deborah Yakubu Maria Jusuf from the town of Borda On the other hand the European directive does not require you to assign powers of international communication to the autonomous police That has been invented by you ladies and gentlemen of the Government because you are still obsessed with the mantra of co-governance With the current model the only possible governance is that everyone exercises his or her powers by assuming his or her own responsibilities and always always with the Government of Spain as the ultimate responsibility for everything Therefore international relations between authorities and officials should be dealt with by the Government of Spain with its institutions and under its control Because as far as I know Minister as far as I know the Spanish Government today has no control over autonomous police such as Basque or Catalan police And how can the Spanish Government ensure that the commanders of these police appointed by governments that do not assume their membership of our nation will behave loyally when their own governments do not do so Can you ensure that the local police share with the National Police and the Civil Guard all information about risks and crimes It is clear that we have no longer seen this for example on the occasion of the coup d'état of October 17 in Catalonia The autonomous police forces are only empowered by constitutional mandate to participate in the maintenance of public security because public security is the exclusive competence of the State hence the need for our amendments because the threats affect us all Spanish and do not understand autonomous borders Since it could not be otherwise we also do not think that they should take advantage of this bill to introduce a new tax that of waste through amendments by the Socialist Group and also to give new powers and money to self government It is seen ladies and gentlemen that they do not miss any opportunity to put our hand more in our pockets You socialist ladies and gentlemen and your conglomerate of communists coups and flounders are already out you are in free fall as VOX grows election after election If you still have a minimum of shame save yourself all the more suffering Spaniards and let go of those who can bring order and above all decency Nothing more and thank you very

#AndrésAlbertoRodríguezAlmeida,"Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen the natural disaster caused by the volcano of La Palma was the perfect occasion for the Social Communist Government of President Sánchez to amend at least at the very least the progressive deterioration of his image by over motivating since the beginning of the legislature the betrayal of the electoral promises not to agree with the Communists of Podemos or with the Filoetatras of Bildu the Delcygate scandal and the thousand versions of Minister Ábalos the unconstitutionality of the states of alarm and the kidnapping of Congress the invasion of the mafias of illegal immigration the rapprochement of terrorists to approve the budgets and a long et cetera It was the perfect opportunity to fulfill at least in favor of a very small number of Spaniards with that slogan of do not leave anyone behind with which they have deceived the Spaniards since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic It was the perfect occasion but President Sánchez for all he has served is to show off his complete ineptitude to solve the problems of the Spaniards So many times in Falcon the president and ministers for what Nothing at all It is not a personal opinion it is a general opinion ladies and gentlemen I am surprised that those who are theoretically representatives of the people and especially of the palm trees are so satisfied with this situation because it is not the reality Yesterday the palm trees went out into the street after a month that the volcanic activity ended to highlight the drama that the palm trees live On October 28 they also interviewed an illustrious resident of La Palma at COPE Lanzarote just before he touched me and I was lucky enough to hear these words I literally read You have n't got a euro from the administrations you have n't got a euro from the administrations It 's been over 40 days and the ones that 's left You do n't have to be there so much you have to figure it out and point it out That hassle over the journeys in the Falcon in order not to solve anything is manifested by a gentleman named Jerónimo Saavedra I do n't know if he sounds to them a declared Mason President of the Government of the Canary Islands twice minister and I do n't know if he is still a socialist militant As for the content of the actual decree that is intended to be validated today it is inevitable for me to highlight the difference between how the Spaniards who have suffered this drama and the non-Spanishs whose need is not even to be believed It will be one more edition of mathematics to progress First elemental premise money is a scarce and therefore limited resource Well for those who have lost everything total destruction of habitual housing the only thing that is expected is 60 480 euros That money is the one that will receive a family that has stayed on the street with nothing On the other side of the comparison we see how illegal immigrants who violate our borders and refuse to provide any documentation and information the State rewards them by financing their stay in establishments at 120 euros a day Remember the figure only in 126 days four immigrants have consumed exactly the same amount They do n't have to worry about where they 're going to sleep where they 're going to have breakfast or where they 're going to eat And there are already more than 40,000 illegal immigrants who have arrived in the last two years in the Canary Islands Make the numbers if they 're capable As they so like to quote Pope Francis despite being declared persecutors of the Church as laymen and communists I will tell you a fundamental aspect of the Catholic doctrine that any child of the first year of catechesis of first communion knows to see if they fall off the horse indeed today Christians celebrate the conversion of the Apostle Paul I guess you 'll know that charity is ordered by definition because if it 's not ordered by definition it would n't be a virtue anymore it would become a perversion like a perverted father who snatches bread from his hungry children to give it to those who do n't even know it With the treatment that was being given to illegal immigrants in three and four star hotels the Canary Islands had been imagining and thinking about what would happen when the Canary Islands again had another fire or catastrophe Will they put us back in the pavilions Indeed that was what happened The day after the eruption I was there in La Palma in the El Fuerte quarter and they did not let me in precisely because that difference of treatment was evident I am also obliged to remind your lords of the People 's Party that their pact with the PSOE to distribute the Cabildo de La Palma and the City of Santa Cruz de La Palma as they did in Lanzarote has left the palm trees completely orphaned by public representatives who fight for their interests in the face of the meekness of the amount of the aid and the delay in its

censure Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Parliamentary Group you have betrayed your voters by giving up any opposition just so that you can stay in the Government 's armchairs Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party they lie when they say that they are the opposition to the PSOE they lie blatantly and that farce makes their betrayal even more serious With a government of socialists and communists we do not even aspire to improve aid for illegal immigrants but we do demand that it be at least the same amount Although he has forgotten his main obligation is to help and protect the Spaniards and if they are not willing to do so what they have to do is resign call elections and allow the Spaniards to put them in their place for their lies and betrayals Thank you very

#PedroFernándezHernández,Thank you President First I would like to join of course in welcoming the delegation of the Courts of Aragon to this Congress and in particular my colleague Santiago Morón This reform of the Aragon Autonomy Statute on the elimination of the severances of members of the Courts and the Aragon Government to be tried by the High Court of Justice of Aragon or where appropriate the Supreme Court in line with what has been adopted on previous occasions with respect to other autonomous statutes and the fixing of a minimum number of deputies with representation in Courts namely 14 per province was essential As for the first question it was essential because we have a clear example of how the prerogative of afforestation the prerogative of afforestation had become an unacceptable privilege and a legal and political distortion which in turn had resulted in a democratic degeneration I am referring to what has been happening with the Government of Catalonia since 2014 A first illegal consultation only merited the conviction of Artur Mas then president of the Generalitat for disobedience by the Supreme Court of Justice of Catalonia freeing himself from the penalty of imprisonment for embezzlement of public funds when later this was claimed by the Court of Auditors itself to return these public funds improperly used in this consultation In other words there was privileged treatment of the then President of the Catalan Government Then in the trial of the trial we meet with some defendants finally convicted by the Supreme Court who claimed as active and passive the competence of the Superior Court of Catalonia thinking that there they will find an equally privileged treatment for their beating behaviors And finally that feeling of impunity we have today A few days ago Mr Pere Aragonès publicly stated that Catalonia will vote for independence in the hope that the suffocation once again could serve as a parapet to unthinkable conduct in a modern democracy By the way a gentleman named Aragonès who supports a consultation for the breakup of Spain and who does so from Catalonia often has this gentleman 's mental cocoa The explanatory statement of this reform proposal is correct when it states that suffocation is a legal figure perceived by the majority of society as anachronistic typical of past times which today hardly fits into article 14 of the Spanish Constitution which enshrines the principle of equal citizenship before the law I add more so when such a degenerate use is made of it in the Government of Catalonia as I have already explained But this statement of reasons has not been so clear as to warn an important detail that the elimination of the hindrances in short is a reversal a full recovery to the State of competence to judge and execute the judgment in accordance with the rules that apply to the rest of the Spaniards Because here what is relevant to the independence forces was not so much in the referral to the Supreme Court in their case which of course would not be done by system but in attempts to appropriate the judicial competence of the higher courts of justice by those autonomous governments led by independence parties who always wanted to pressure and interfere with the much needed judicial independence With this reform therefore it is fully returned to the judiciary as the power of the state its full competence to judge and execute the judged and this is something that VOX has been maintaining since its foundation With regard to the second question of reform it is equally clear that depopulation can never mean the nullification of any representative political capacity and influence of a province and we also think that this reform is appropriate on this point In short we will vote in favour of the reform proposal Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,36.415356,10.7863655,18,thank president first would like join course welcoming delegation
