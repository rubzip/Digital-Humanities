"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Mr Echenique I imagine that from the coat of vision is said by your former advisor Podemos Cristóbal Gallego Councillor of Enagas who has charged almost 70,000 euros in just six months I guess he says so for him Turning to the question today we are discussing a proposal for a law of the communist group of the House which like any communist initiative is limited to urging state control of anything in this case of hydroelectric plants to create a public energy company called Spanish energy production I wish this government could move the water through Spain with the same looseness with which the water dances to the communists separatists and bildutaras in order to keep itself at all costs in power But as we have explained more often a public energy company is not the solution to high energy prices In their proposal for a law they state that direct management of the hydroelectric fleet through a public undertaking could solve the high price of the electricity bill That is literally what they say in their proposal Well this is simply a lie Perhaps it was the solution to put your friends and family in another little chiringuito I do n't doubt that but certainly not to lower the electric bill to the Spaniards Besides we have numerous examples it 's not something that says VOX We have many examples such as that of Italy with its public company paying an average price higher than in Spain or that of France where the Government has just announced a recapitalisation for more than EUR 2 billion due precisely to the economic difficulties of its public energy company or that of Mexico with very high electricity prices four blackouts in the last three years and its public energy company in technical bankruptcy But without going so far the public electricity of his fellow Kichi in Cadiz Eléctrica de Cadiz has been forced like any other private company to raise prices in order to avoid incurring losses Ladies and gentlemen the only difference between a public and a private enterprise is that the public is subject to the interests of politicians and the private to the interests of the market which we are all citizens of this country In addition a public energy company only ensures that costs and risks are borne by the money of all Spaniards and does not offer any added advantage to private management If today there was a public company composed of all the hydroelectric plants in Spain the price of energy would continue to set historical peaks every day Why Very simple because it would continue to operate in a regulated European market with the same rules for everyone regardless of whether management is public or private So gentlemen of Podemos stop diverting attention from the real problem which is you your political decisions and those of this government Those are the ones that have caused and continue to cause an increase in the price of energy and not the ownership of the companies that manage it Ladies and gentlemen what would happen if we had right now operating the nuclear power plants shut down by bipartisanism What would happen if we could continue to count in this energy crisis with the coal thermal power plants that you so hastened to shut down Do you think we'd be in this situation Well surely not And surely the reservoirs would not have been emptied by high electricity prices either The decision of the electricians to empty the reservoirs in summer has caused the water reserves to be already less than half when the average in the last ten years for these dates has always been more than 60 This is particularly worrying in southern Spain in communities such as Andalusia where they are only 30 or in Murcia 22 This situation is also exacerbated by the lack of infrastructure necessary to bring water to all regions and to co-ordinate the nation indeed by the repeal by the PSOE of the transfer of the Ebro in the National Hydrological Plan We know that companies have economic interests it is true which sometimes leads to neglect of other issues relating to the common good such as the environmental impact or economic activity and the way of life of the regions especially in rural Spain But what are the politicians for ladies and gentlemen Who is directly responsible for these reservoirs Who has allowed companies to empty them even if they can avoid it Hydrographic confederations And on whom do hydrographic confederations depend Lords of Podemos and Government Of the same public administration that for example authorized the emptying of reservoirs such as that of Ricobayo in Zamora or that of Valdecañas in Cáceres And we still have to listen to the government and the minister of energy ruin and demographic hell complaining about something that depends on their own ministry Amazing If the Administration is not even able to properly manage this irregular use so that companies do not exploit the reservoirs to this point how will they be able to ensure their optimal and efficient management They apply the same hypocrisy to everything as they sink this country They regret the unorthodox prices of energy while practicing a suicidal energy policy that attacks our energy sovereignty They close nuclear and coal plants in Spain and then import nuclear and coal energy from countries such as France and Morocco It would only be necessary for you gentlemen of the Government to talk about human rights by negotiating with terrorists Oh no I 'm sorry they 're already doing this They are the face of an unbearable cynicism with a president of the government who lands in Ciudad Real in a Super Puma helicopter which spends an average of 600 litres of kerosene at the hour to demand a green and renewable energy consumption from citizens who impoverish and ruin every day to supposedly combat climate change I 'm running out of adjectives for you ladies and gentlemen There is plenty of water for all the provinces in Spain and what we must do is to ensure that every drop reaches every corner of the country through a national hydrological plan Not only do we have to make sure that the wifi which comes too but it must first reach all regions In addition it should be reconsidered whether with the current energy mix water should continue to be devoted to electricity generation or whether it has greater value for other uses such as human agricultural tourism etc. which have no substitution and of course energy storage Make it clear and I will finish Madam President that in VOX we will not allow the rights of the Spaniards to be restricted by invoking their false and globalist Agenda 2030 We will promote through the interconnection of all the basins a green and prosperous Spain that guarantees industrial development compatible with the environmental sustainability and well being of all Spaniards"
Thank you President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Good morning minister Today we discuss the budgets for 2023 of the Ministry of Science and Innovation in a country where only the consumption of Jabugo ham in Moncloa is higher than the average salary of a researcher in Spain These are budgets in which you Minister say to prioritize science but the only thing that you prioritize is your ideology your globalist agenda and of course you yourself with millionaire items in institutional advertising The Government of Spain had never spent so much or so badly The budgets that Spain needs must include a high courageous and transformative percentage of investment in science and innovation with a rationalization of expenditure taking into account not only how much but above all how in order for real budgetary policies to improve the working conditions of scientists to reduce bureaucracy to increase flexibility and agility in the management of public research bodies to retain and attract real talent if we compare with wages in an international context and to boost a growing investment in R D+ i Did we get it from these budgets The answer is no Firstly because of the current macroeconomic context The very high inflation we suffer is actually causing the funds available for science and innovation to be even at risk of being lower than the previous year and this does not say VOX this has been denounced by the Confederation of Scientific Societies of Spain minister Without going any further do you know the huge increase in costs that you are putting on research centres and universities simply paying off energy bills Triplicated costs that you have to deduct of course from the budget that you allocate to research a situation that further precariouss your activity and that you have caused minister so less blows to the chest Secondly because of your constant attacks on tax deductions on R D+i because you and the Minister of Finance are not clear as to the bases of deduction putting at risk not only our legal certainty but the 3.5 billion euros per year of investment in R D+i that Spain needs so much Thirdly because one third of the funds of this ministry are European funds that have an expiry date until 2024 And then what What will happen when they are not or worse if you fail to execute them as we already see happening Today only 5 of the Parties have been resolved a small 5 of the total in all these months which makes it impossible to allocate all the necessary investments in time These budgets should be designed to replace in the coming years all this money from European funds in funds of national origin and what is contained in these spending policies is simply contrary to this path How are we going to increase national funds in research and innovation if most of them have to come from the private sector as is already the case in Germany and the UK and you are working to sabotage our main instrument to encourage research and development which are these tax deductions to R D+i that I am commenting on If we add to all this the almost chronic problem that these budgets do not solve which is the low percentage of financial funds that are being implemented which do not reach half we can conclude that these budgets are not by far in line with the objectives that we must set ourselves for the policies of science and innovation in Spain If that were not enough these general budgets of the State as a whole intoxicate everything they touch with their ideology and sectarianism and in this case unfortunately also science They intend to include their sick gender dimension in research through initiatives such as the creation of a gender equality badge in R D+i for the centres or the creation of chiringuitos that by the way deprive researchers such as the Women Science and Innovation Observatory the unity of equality or the unity of women and science and not only that but also seek to impose scientific and technological vocations on girls and young women Yes I say impose and in this sense I would like to ask you the following do you know the Nordic paradox Minister I think I 've told him before This study shows that in more developed countries with a higher degree of gender equality such as Nordics women tend to choose less often to work or study in the fields of science technology engineering or mathematics Do you know why minister Because there is a greater quality of life and freedom in welfare States and therefore the academic strengths and personal interests of women prevail In other words their obsessive sectarianism over diversity does not prevail over freedom or meritocracy On the other hand the participation of the female labour force in mining is 7.5 compared to 92.5 of men Do n't you want equity there minister Why do n't I see mining women 's development workshops or support for women 's development in mining Minister Why not Let women choose in peace Finally but not least I would like to stress the missed opportunity of these budgets to co-ordinate and reduce territorial inequalities in R D I especially in rural Spain bearing in mind that investment of this kind is a key indicator for the development of the regions We know that this government shows a strange preference for favouring criminals from beatings and bildutars to rapists and sexual aggressors while it has no objection to subjecting the Spaniards to the most ironic and strict of convictions more taxes more ruin more unemployment and more indebtedness Ladies and gentlemen the one who produces while others have his production is a slave With these budgets minister they have turned the Spaniards into slaves of sanchismo Let the Spaniards decide call elections and with all the empirical evidence of the data leave minister Thank you very much
Thank you President Good afternoon deputies This government has already managed to make us here today in this Chamber part of 10 of the Spaniards who can afford to have their home at a more or less decent temperature at a temperature comparable to that which we also have in this Chamber about 27 degrees 27 comfortable degrees which allow us to be here today in this Chamber practically in short sleeves We can be here practically in short sleeves while millions of Spaniards in their homes can't turn on the heating That is why you legislate as you legislate because you do not suffer the consequences of your ideological and sectarian policies it is the Spaniards who bear them Ladies and gentlemen we have gas deposits in Spain for over 40 years we have the world 's second largest uranium reserves we have in the Canary Islands the world 's largest deposits of telurium a key mineral for solar energy but what is the government doing The Government prohibited by law the exploitation of that gas the Government prohibited by law the exploitation of that uranium for nuclear energy and the Government de facto handed over the canary deposits to Moroccan expansionism How long does the megawatt hour have to come gentlemen of the government for you to react at once And by the way the gas that Spain will receive from the United States is the result of fracking which is forbidden in Spain also for you The energy we receive from France and Morocco produced with nuclear and coal is generated with the same power stations that you here today close and demonize every day And says the PSOE spokesman that we have to abandon fossil fuels as soon as possible Yeah to make a difference of course They want to abandon them to import them because they do not think enough of the energy dependence that we have already suffered in Spain 75 a tremendously high energy dependence and that because of this government we will be able to increase and worsen a dependence that impoverishes us and weakens us as a nation We are beating all the records ladies and gentlemen including the index of misery in the developed world where we already occupy the first place because with this government we have the highest inflation in our history the highest public debt in our history the most expensive bill of light in our history By the way are you also going to put all this in Pedro Sánchez 's new Netflix series I 'm sure you do are n't you But let 's talk about energy do n't let me sleep here with the summery temperature we have in the Chamber It is good to facilitate the development of hydrogen in Spain of course it improves and diversifys our energy sovereignty Making the most of all our resources strengthens us as a nation and it is also vital to put them at the service of Spain and the Spaniards to defend ours Because if we were to depend on our own ladies and gentlemen we would not be so foolish as to be the only country that by law prohibits the exploitation and research of its own resources wasting enormous productive potential causing a possible shortage of raw materials for industry and causing even more misery to all Spaniards If we depended on it this government would not be flying thermal power plants in the midst of an energy crisis to kneel down to climate fanaticism which threatens our rural world and our industry Sidef Let 's say ours ladies and gentlemen it will not give more than EUR 20 billion to its gender ideology while giving 20 cents per litre to our transporters who just want to work And above all we would not have reached this situation of national crisis to which all of you have led us How many demonstrations with almost half a million people need to start working and offer solutions to the Spaniards But of course all the protesters are now of the far right ladies and gentlemen now if you fight for your children 's bread this government points you to the ultra and the facha Do you know what kind of ultras we are in VOX We are ultras in demanding urgent solutions to the misery that you provoke we are ultras in demanding an immediate reduction of taxes on electricity and hydrocarbons and we are ultras in advancing our energy sovereignty and in ensuring the transparency of every public euro invested as we have already proposed in our amendments to which of course as VOX puts it you will vote against even if you are of full common sense And finally ladies and gentlemen the only shock plan that works in this country is for you to resign as a bloc and do it now Call for general elections now Thank you very much
Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen minister Madam Minister I wish you were able to control the price of energy with the same eagerness that Pedro Sánchez wants to control Indra Post Offices the INE the CIS I wish but unfortunately it 's not After all the political verborrhea that you have released us here given it kills story I will sum up your energy policy in two minutes 165 euros fill an average tank of petrol 76 euros the average bill of light in June already applied its wonderful Iberian exception 10 higher than the month of May without its wonderful Iberian exception 3 euros per litre the price of the fuel to which we will surely arrive this summer 500 gas stations that have already had to close and hundreds that are already on the verge of bankruptcy because their government has forced them to act as banks 10.2 the rate of inflation fulminating any measure that they have been able to apply to date 2000 million euros increases their collection for each percentage point that rises in inflation and 14 billion euros is paid to this government only with the increase of electricity and revenues for CO2 emissions And how much does this government give back to the Spanish Zero zero euros And how much do they aim to alleviate the effects of their disastrous energy policy Not half of everything they collect with the rise of the energy bill nor with their tax reduction policies which we have been told here today nor with their subsidy to diesel This is the X -ray of the looting of this government 's energy policy The ruined Spaniards broken because of their policies and you 're breaking all the collection records Thus this government can afford to promise millions of euros for video games millions of euros to renew trade union seats to encourage illegal immigration or to target more than 20 billion euros to keep gender bars come on measures buy votes to try to curb this government 's debacle And in the meantime we continue to lead the countries with the greatest deficit the highest public debt higher inflation and the highest unemployment rate in the European Union That 's what you call a very chulsian scenario for the Spaniards Minister you know you can still lower the price bill much more they have much more room to keep going down Why do n't they Wait because he does n't leave Europe We could not lower the VAT on electricity because it did not leave Europe but it was enough an unprecedented electoral defeat in Andalusia so that it did not take them 24 hours to announce the reduction of VAT which they supposedly could not do And now they intend to apply effective measures such as raising taxes to electricity when they know that this is not going to solve the problem of the millions of households and companies that cannot simply pay their bill for light Of course the electrics must tie their shoulders and they must be part of the solution of course we can even discuss whether this measure can be more or less just but ladies and gentlemen does it tackle the problem Is the electric bill reduced to the Spanish No no Who benefits from this measure To you to this government only to you Is your anti-crisis package a package of measures to save the Spanish or to save Sánchez the autocrat Ladies and gentlemen the light has been out of control as you know for over a year now long before Putin began to invade Ukraine The electric bill began to cover press headlines in the middle of Filomena Do you remember minister Do you remember that it 's a temporary and short term fact Do you remember as we warned you over and over again from VOX about the risks and the risks we were faced with with their ideological policies It was January 2021 and since then the price has not stopped rising as this government looked elsewhere VOX wants to be the voice of common sense in this House We are against their climate policies which we call climate fanaticism because only a fanatic is capable of harming their country at all costs applying measures in the name of the survival of the planet without any coherent or technical basis This should be heard in particular by those Members ladies and gentlemen who came to this rostrum yesterday before the motion we tabled from my group and again gave a false and distorted message of what VOX is defending Because in VOX we have the humility enough to know that we do not have all the answers to the climate change debate or to the temperature change on the planet But you know what That you do n't have them either We just refuse to accept inconsistent policies hypocritical and sectarian policies which is very different from what you said in this rostrum yesterday VOX wants to preserve and conserve the environment of course certainly more than you do but its ideological policies do not apply ecology they use it to empty our pockets In VOX we believe yes in a Europe that defends the interests of the Spanish even if the globalists call this anti-Europeanism And yes we are critical of any sectarian policy that goes against the interests of the Spanish We try to apply common sense and from what we see every day in this House there is only VOX left to denounce the absence of this sense in the crazy policies that the Government implements And if not explain to me here today what criterion is behind banning research and exploitation of our resources to import them more expensive than other countries Explain to me Minister what technical criterion is behind a hasty shutdown of nuclear power plants in Spain knowing that it is a firm and clean technology and on which we depend What logical criterion is behind flying thermal power plants in Spain to buy coal energy from other countries such as Morocco You have spoken about fundamental problems but this Government has tried to solve all energy problems without going to the fundamental problem which is nothing other than its own climate and ideological policies The result the gasoline becoming more expensive and the bill of light constantly rising This Government instead of attacking the origin of the problem is dedicated to intervening in the outcome Go to the origin minister and listen to me well pay attention to me which then says we do n't propose anything They demand first of all to curb the speculative market for CO2 emissions which greatly increases the energy bill And until they do they start returning to the Spaniards every euro of the millions of euros that the government is pocketing with CO2 allowances or dedicate themselves directly to lowering the bill The tonnage of CO2 has increased from EUR 7 in 2012 to more than EUR 80 in 2022 which is causing for example that our thermal power plants are not profitable and that for this reason we have to import energy from coal plants from Morocco because of course they do not pay CO2 To all the climate change gurus present in this House I ask what happens if the emissions are emitted by Morocco do not affect the atmosphere Explain it to me Is it so hard to understand that we can't get rid of technologies that we depend on At least let 's do it until we stop depending on them Is it so hard to understand What we must ask Europe Minister is not to limit the price of gas but an urgent reform in the wholesale electricity pricing market the design of which causes us to be paying these astronomical prices in the electricity bill It is not a question of applying games of trilers such as their Iberian exception it is a question of demanding and proposing a structural reform that will stop condemning our country to ruin and energy misery Why do they not propose for example to take the gas completely out of the marginalist market It would be a much more effective ambitious and efficient measure that would indeed significantly lower the bill Another issue is to have all our strategic resources and a balanced energy mix that offers low prices security and firmness Minister one out of every five times that the light is on in Spain nuclear energy is consumed and you not only suffocate the nuclear sector but in turn cause a diplomatic crisis with our main gas supplier Algeria or give the Sahara to Morocco damaging our claims on numerous millionaire natural resources such as the Tropic underwater volcano which has fifty thousand times more tellurium than there is usually in the deposits of this metal on land Minister I 'm not surprised that you do n't look at me and that you only know how to look down when I speak to you because no one who has done to Spain the damage that you are doing to you can look to another place other than the ground Minister One last curiosity On the NATO dinner menu we saw olives red tuna mustard brochettes cebiche tiger milk corvina rich with oil soup and pink grapefruit among other exquisite I wanted to ask you a question
or the menu that the Spaniards recommend to wear at the taper minister Thank you so much
Thank you President Minister your lifesaver does n't work either to save you or the Spaniards Moreover as has already been said they are sinking into sectors as important as cogeneration which has fallen by 50 even though it is an essential technology for industry In case it were not enough the sticks on the wheels and the constant attacks that this Government is receiving they are now also attacking its main power source which is also one of the most efficient In just two weeks since the application of its wonderful Iberian exception they have stopped producing 5 of electricity in Spain The problem does not have it with me Minister and spokesman of the Socialist Party they have it with the reality of the data that we have been telling them here by the various Members that we are going through arguing one by one why their measures do not work They have n't reduced the bill for the light They lied promising a 20 discount Where 's that discount Stop telling stories stop telling us stories here Where 's the discount they promised us Where is he It 's not it 's just not By the way to the socialist deputy upset because he mentioned the diet of the 2030 Agenda it can be seen that he would have preferred worms right to ceviche and prawns I would also like to say to the Socialist Party of course that we know what congestion rents are Even if you 're very smart the rest of us also know in fact we talked about it last week You must be more attentive to what is said in this rostrum that you are being beaten by your minister 's bad education But it is also that once the congestion rents have been discounted which is what we say according to the data the French system continues to pay almost half a million euros a day Spanish consumers in fact are subsidizing energy in France and Portugal Electrical interconnections with French territory are operating from the start of its energy island to the maximum of its capacity Portugal has also decreased national production of gas based electricity because it is supplying it with the energy that imports from Spain avoiding its consumers paying the compensation of the gas companies because we already pay all the Spanish It 's the first time I 've seen ladies and gentlemen I have to admit how a discount increases the final price To solve the problem is to have a 200 increase in the wholesale price of electricity compared to a year ago Is that solving the problem You however as you have indicated are very satisfied with your measures and I am not surprised because considering that you have a President of the Government who considers it a good result to have thirty seven corpses in the Melilla fence which is a well solved one I am not surprised that it seems a good result to you If thirty seven corpses according to your government is a good result I do n't know what would have been fifty corpses magnificent sensational If they had protected the southern border as we have been warning them for years our civilian guards would not be assaulted on a daily basis and we would not have to regret massive flows of illegal immigration that lead to death You know it and you do n't do anything Once again VOX was right just as we warned them You have caused the biggest energy economic and social crisis in our country with consequences that all Spaniards suffer while you continue to comfortably depreciate our resources and stifle nuclear power With a completely outdated PIC which you mentioned based on an electric power park with a gas at 20 euros when today it is over 100 and a shutdown of the nuclear park in the midst of this energy crisis that we simply cannot afford They also despise science and innovation and the mini-nuclears already planned by the way all over the planet except in Spain Three hundred micro-reactors planned in the United States until 2050 others in China France the United Kingdom Canada Do you know Minister that Morocco is also investing in nuclear energy Rejoice because within a time Moroccans will also be able to sell us the nuclear energy they generate in their power plants much more expensive than we would because we will have closed them already Rejoice minister because it seems that this government wants to destroy every productive sector of this country from oranges to grain and even fuel itself In Spain we do not even study mononuclears we paralyze million dollar farms of natural resources and we do not allow gas to be removed from our soils because for what if we can already buy it much more expensive to Americans French or Moroccans In addition I will tell you one last thing and I finish Spain is the third country in Europe with more mining resources but they are not exploited by ecological pressures
It 's over Mr. President We have thirty millionaire mining projects in Spain totally paralyzed which bring us employment wealth and energy sovereignty
Come on President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Today a terrorist group comes to tell us that it wants to narrow the digital divide in the attention to citizens Sounds like a joke does n't it Bildu worried about narrowing gaps when they were born precisely to open them In particular to open irreparable gaps in the broken heart of all the families of the victims who have to endure how this unscrupulous government whites and favors terrorists who mercilessly murdered their loved ones It is simply foolish that they intend to make us believe in this motion that the political arm of ETA cares about the well being of the citizenry when reason
As I said it is a foolish thing to make us believe that billionaires care about the well being of citizens when the reason for their existence is precisely to bleed out the foundations of our democracy which protects the freedom equality and unity of all Spaniards Digital breach You want us to talk about a digital divide But if Bildu is the only gap that matters to him is the gap that breaks down coexistence the gap that discriminates between the Spanish language that breaks down territorial unity and the gap that destroys our rule of law That 's the only breach that matters to Bildu Having said that I have to say that VOX has always defended the need to drastically reduce bureaucracy and reconcile the face to face world with the digital world precisely to ensure that all citizens have access to procedures with the Administration We have recently done so for example in the process of the new common agricultural policy where VOX expressly demanded that digital procedures be made compulsory in order to be able to carry them out immediately and thus save farmers and farmers from the digital discrimination imposed by this Government with its law in a new attempt by the way to attack our primary sector and the rural world But ladies and gentlemen I will tell you something that everyone knows and that is that in VOX we are never going to be accomplices ever ever of any attempt to whitewash the billionaires because even though the terrorist is dressed as a congressman
Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen minister We are here by a royal decree that they present with a title full of grandiose words such as promoting electric mobility or promoting self consumption in short the constant political verborrea to which this Government has accustomed us But first of all I would like to ask you whether you see it normal to mix in the same royal decree questions on the energy sector the Cooperatives Act the Social Security Act with the reduction of the VAT on masks which by the way applies only to surgical masks of course because to the most expensive ones to the FFP2 with which this government most collects they do not apply a reduction of VAT even if they are the ones that most protect citizens especially in the interior spaces This royal decree is a clear example of how this is not only the government of improvisation and legislative splendour but also an elephantic government oversized full of bureaucracy and client networks which only knows how to stop the little wealth that allows the Spaniards to generate from being destined to pay salaries of politicians as expendable and unnecessary as you Minister They claim in this royal decree to have identified some factors that hinder the expansion of renewable energies Have you bought a mirror Minister You blame this text first on the difficulties of access to transport and distribution networks and secondly on the bureaucratic difficulties and inability of the Administration to process a large number of projects But minister who are responsible who create these difficulties You guys At least with this royal decree they recognize the hellish bureaucracy they generate and that it is a problem that discourages the development of the energy sector But what about the rest of the sectors the persistent bureaucratic tyranny in the rest of the fields such as for example the research centres in this country the granting of aid with European funds administrative licences etc Do n't these deserve the attention of the government You include in this royal decree the extension of tax rebates on the electric bill of the Spaniards something that we support in VOX which as you know we have been asking since the first day we stepped on Congress but in our case we advocate permanent not temporary measures as you propose and also much more ambitious such as the introduction of a super reduced VAT of 4 on the electric bill for the Spanish households Today you are extending 10 of the household electricity bill but that is totally insufficient because it is still one of the highest VAT in the European Union VOX proposes a structural reform that would greatly reduce the electricity bill of the Spanish but you prefer to create ration cards which you call social bonds to subsidise the energy poverty that this government causes Then they are outraged when we call them chavistas minister Having said that it is important to talk about the installation of charging points for electric vehicles yes but it is also important to assess the problems associated with this authoritarian transition to the electric vehicle Do you understand that in this transition to electric mobility there are thousands of Spaniards who can lose their jobs as a result for example of the disappearance of workshops and manufacturers of spare parts or components such as chassis transmissions and non-electronic equipment or that without specific plans to install large battery plants in Spain the automotive sector will be losing even more than 40 of the added value for each vehicle that becomes electric What do you intend to do Minister to save the thousands of jobs and mitigate the impact of electric mobility on the car industry when we are the second largest producing country in Europe And with regard to the environment which they seem to be so concerned about what recycling plan do they have for when they flood our country with huge heavy polluting batteries I 'm telling you none Why do they not encourage for example other types of fuels such as biofuels which do not need batteries and are also so essential for industrial transport for heavy and long distance transport The answer is that industry jobs and the environment are alike Last morning Thursday Spain will stop producing aluminum because the 512 tanks of electrolysis in San Cibrao in Lugo will be turned from being the European jewel in the sector to being a company without activity and all because the price of electricity in this country already assumed a quarter of the cost of production and this does not count on the risks of energy supply which pose problems as badly managed by you as the pipeline of Algeria the urgent purchase of 180 000 tons of coal that will burn the central of As Pontes or that we have fired the import of oil and gas from the United States in a long number of misconceptions that have caused insurmountable bills for any sector enterprise self employed or average family in this country In short this royal decree is a further demonstration of how the government improvises and starts the house on the roof trying to first impose electric mobility on the Spaniards without even having enough unloading infrastructure And it is surprising to see how their policies lead to money transfers from lower rents to higher rents which are precisely the ones that buy these electric vehicles Can you explain to me Minister why a worker or self employed person who moves by bus or subway and perhaps not even arrive at the end of the month have to subsidize with the money of his taxes the expenses of a new electric car to the highest class in this country Is the government going to leave Disney 's policy and fight for the Spaniards Or are you going to keep making the bed to Pedro Sánchez 's globalism and personal agenda I finish Minister with a very simple question one that any worker head of family or self employed person would do to him in my place and it is what he does there sitting having failed and having made the lives of the Spaniards so much worse Lift up take your suitcase and resign and at least recover some of the personal dignity that this Government has long lost Thank you very much
Mr President ladies and gentlemen we are debating a proposal for a law amending two laws affecting the Court of Auditors Law 2/1982 and Law 7/1988 Interestingly after almost forty years in force of the first law and thirty five years in force of the second Junts per Catalunya now realize the need to reform both laws and argue as they indicate in the statement of reasons for the proposed law that the court maintains certain functions due to the pressures that existed from the employees and members of the Court of Accounts Francois a Court of Accounts whose origins date back to the Courts of Valladolid of 1351 where some real offices that are given the name of accountants already appear And they realize precisely when the Court of Auditors rejected the endorsements with which the Government of the Generality intended to face the payment of the 5.4 million euros that were destined for the international promotion of the independence referendum and the independence process of Catalonia Mention is made of the intention to bring the legal configuration of the Court of Auditors closer to the basic constitutional principles of the rule of law which are the division of public authorities and the subjection of their actions to judicial control Curious complaint comes from a political party that continuously demonstrates that it does not respect the Constitution that it does not respect court decisions and that it does not respect the independence of justice For the VOX Parliamentary Group three are the main points to analyze The first any reform must be aimed at promoting the independence and impartiality of the functioning of the Court of Auditors and that is to revise the criteria for appointing advisers I would like to mention in this respect the review carried out in 2015 by the European Court of Auditors and the Court of Auditors of Portugal In the report issued by the two bodies it was recommended that the procedures for the appointment of accounting officers be reviewed and in particular that objective criteria be defined and that conditions for access to the post be clarified in greater detail Pure common sense Those of us who have experience in auditing know that the requirement of independence is key within the framework of ethical principles and professional rules that are reflected both in the Audit Act and its regulations and in international auditing standards Second This proposal for a law is intended to transfer the instruction of the procedures for reinstatement by the scope of the training delegates who are officials to the directors of accounts It is undeniable that in view of the procedure for appointing advisers this proposal does not strengthen the necessary independence in education and is a failure to achieve efficiency The professionalisation of the staff of the Court of Auditors must be strengthened staff who according to the Court of Auditors report had a high degree of commitment and technical competence appropriate to their main functions Third It introduces the possibility of delegating to the autonomous supervisory bodies the instruction of the jurisdictional procedures for the prosecution of the accounting liability of those in charge of managing the flow or public effects In VOX we believe that what needs to be done with the external control bodies of the Autonomous Communities is to abolish them and that the work should be carried out by the Court of Auditors Because it is common sense to realise that centralisation of control bodies eliminates duplication facilitates efficiency contributes to impartiality saves costs and fosters unity of approach We are talking about duplication and costs ladies and gentlemen The autonomous state has led to the creation of twelve external control bodies apart from the Court of Auditors which cost the Spanish around 79 million euros a year with budgets ranging from 12.9 million euros of the Union of Accounts of Catalonia by the way the most expensive to 3.2 million Navarra to the 5.1 million euros that the Council of Accounts of Castile and León costs We speak of independence and impartiality requirements that are not reinforced when bodies appointed by the autonomous community itself control matters of the same community We are talking about efficiency and unity of approach characteristics that do not currently occur within the framework of the proliferation of external control bodies Rather the opposite lack of unity of approach is what the Court of Auditors itself stated in its report on the autonomous public sector of the year 2018 talking about the normative inequality between the territories regarding the deadlines for accountability to the court and the supervisory bodies And lack of efficiency which is evident when you turn your back on the best practices of the market And it is that the best audit practices and I have been able to verify it in my twenty nine years of professional experience is that large companies have centralized their internal audit departments and internal enforcement It is truly inconceivable that we should not learn from best practices even more so given that we are talking about the control of public funds I conclude by recalling that seeking impartiality is common sense that seeking efficiency and professionalism is common sense that avoiding politicization is common sense that avoiding duplication is common sense and that VOX is pure common sense Thank you so much
"Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen we are discussing a non-legislative proposal by the People 's Parliamentary Group on changing and adapting the reality to the employment statistics published by SEPE The aim is to improve transparency to provide a further disaggregation of data and to know the reality of the actual unemployment figure defined as the sum of unemployed jobseekers and jobseekers with employment relationships among which are fixed discontinuities Knowing the figure of effective unemployment is essential to undertake the necessary analysis of the labour market in Spain and to propose solutions to its inefficiencies Ladies and gentlemen something does not work on the labour market when the unemployment rate in Spain has risen from 8.8 in 2017 to the current 12.6 while in the euro area the 2007 levels have recovered and in countries such as Germany and the United States it has fallen significantly Something does not work on the labour market when Spain despite not having the actual unemployment figures has been leading OECD unemployment statistics for more than a year Something does not work on the labour market when the youth unemployment rate in Spain has grown from 19.2 in 2007 to 32 today while the youth unemployment rate in the euro area has only increased from 15.6 to 16.5 for the same period Something does not work in the labour market when we are the country that most jobs destroy in times of crisis and the country that takes the longest to recover Something does not work in the labour market when a prestigious educational centre such as the University of Cambridge has placed Spain at the tail of the countries of the European Union in creating jobs productivity or security in the labour market Ladies and gentlemen low productivity is one of the structural problems of the labour market in Spain By 2020 it was 14.1 below the euro area average and was 85.5 below the United States average and this labour productivity gap is one of the factors explaining the distance of the Spanish economy in terms of well being with other euro area countries We must also remember the direct link between unemployment and economic growth It 's very easy Being unemployed means that there is a lack of economic income that limits consumption and therefore there is a drop in sales by companies that decide to cut staff by reducing income Unfortunately we have a government that by ignoring the reality of the labour market is unable to make reliable projections of its future evolution In this regard the Independent Fiscal Accountability Authority in its report on the Government 's Stability Programme for the period 2022 to 2025 questioned the Government 's estimates of ending 2025 with an unemployment rate of 9.6 In the same vein the OECD which does not envisage that the unemployment rate will fall by 12,5 for the period 2022 to 2025 or the European Commission nor does the estimates of the evolution of unemployment in the International Monetary Fund appear In conclusion I would like to remind you that not promoting the transparency of employment data is an indignity that drawing unemployment data from job seekers is an immorality and a lack of sensitivity that making triumphalist speeches with an unemployment rate of 12.6 is a complete obscenity You are giving the institutions a coup d'état and you are also giving statistics a coup d'état Thank you very much"
"Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen Minister we are discussing an amendment to the full refund of the bill to boost employment pension schemes presented by the Gallego Nationalist Block It presents in its justification curious statements that show that they live completely away from reality First he mentions that the belief that private management is more efficient than public management is false It may be but it 's not the most common thing at least in Spain Let us remember that the public accounts in Spain have recorded continued deficits since 2008 that will continue in the coming years 3.2 in 2024 according to the Government 's estimate Honestly I do n't know any efficient managed private companies that have been in loss for fourteen years and continue to exist If Mr. Rego knows any please let us know about her On the other hand the net assets of the consolidated accounts of the state public sector of the year 2020 that is the difference between what we have and what we have shows a negative figure of 579 412 million euros a whole example of efficient management for Mr Rego and the Gallego Nationalist Block What is clear is that both the Gallego Nationalist Block and the Communist Social Government do not know the concept of efficiency of public expenditure and this is demonstrated by the Institute for Economic Studies which quantifies the inefficiency of public expenditure by EUR 60 billion an inefficiency which had already been demonstrated a few years ago by the political party Union Progreso and Democracy Secondly it mentions disinformation and manipulation campaigns on the viability of the pension system It may be but I imagine it will refer to the ongoing disinformation campaigns of the Government and its partners Let us remember that the Social Security accounts are balanced by transfers and loans from the State and that given the deficit situation in the public accounts there will be an increase in the total debt of the public administrations a debt that already stands at 1 427 763 million euros that is more than 30 100 euros per capita Or perhaps we should include in the disinformation campaign to the International Monetary Fund which is warning that if inflation is at 5.1 let us remember that we are at 7.6 pension spending will increase by € 77 billion per year Another issue mentioned as justification for this amendment is that it cannot be accepted as a general mechanism for workers to be able to supplement their public pensions They even talk about the possibility of transferring the management of the economic regime from Social Security to Galicia an obsession of the independenceists in which they will always have us as we have shown with the presentation of a remedy of unconstitutionality for the rupture of the single Social Security box In terms of efficiency I remind you that the debt of the Autonomous Communities in September 2021 was 310,180 million euros Let 's see an example of efficiency Let us now proceed with the bill to boost employment pension schemes We are talking about a bill that remains short in its proposals consolidates inequalities and points to political leadership First there are clearly insufficient tax incentives incentives that focus on bonus social security contributions but they forget to incorporate an additional incentive into corporate tax as it existed until 2012 Secondly they set limits on the maximum contributions of workers to their employment plans and make them dependent on the contributions of companies It seems that the members of the BNG do not understand either that the increase in the savings to be generated by the employment pension schemes will make it possible to have greater resources in the national economy as a whole to invest increase productive capacity and thereby create employment and raise the standard of living of the Spanish society Thirdly the interference of the State in the management of the money of the workers and self employed is protected since it will be public employees of the ministries who decide what is done and where the money of the public promotion plans is invested Fourthly it is a bill that discriminates against self employed workers who can only be deducted a maximum of € 5750 per year between the employment pension plan and the individual plan and moreover do not have the corporate share subsidies that companies do have Fifthly it is a bill that consolidates the discrimination of individual pension schemes since contributions with right to deduction in the IRPF are maintained at 1500 euros Sixthly it consolidates discrimination against the outside territories where the limit of the annual contribution to the individual social security system is 5000 euros compared to 1500 euros from the rest of Spain Ladies and gentlemen in VOX we are voting for mechanisms to supplement the public pension In VOX we are voting for measures to improve the quality of life of pensioners In VOX we vote yes to efficient public management That is why Mr Rego we voted in favour of your proposal in VOX Thank you very much"
"Thank you Mr. President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The Government presents us with a social security budget that contains very significant data First thing Despite the € 38,904 million in transfers a deficit for non-financial operations of € 7199 million is budgeted which has multiplied by almost five since 2011 but does not prevent a continuing deficit for non-financial operations Let us remember that in order to finance these transfers and the loans covering the remaining deficit the State has to be indebted and the question is can public accounts ensure the level of transfers in the future The answer is no and we are based on three main reasons The first is that the projected deficit in the public accounts will amount to 3.9 of GDP in 2023 that deficit according to the stability programme will continue for the next two years and that deficit according to the estimates of the International Monetary Fund will exceed 4 by 2027 The second reason is that Spain 's public debt is at a historical peak reaching the amount of EUR 1.5 trillion The third reason is that the Social Communist Government has no intention of cutting political spending Second of all The amount of passive class pensions which are not part of the Social Security budget amounts to EUR 20.5 billion If we add to this amount transfers and loans we are talking about EUR 69 billion of expenditure that is not financed by social contributions Third dice A social contribution income of EUR 14,702 million is budgeted below the contribution pension This is a gap that will widen in view of the current population pyramid and the early retirement of the baby boom generation a gap that is 5.2 times greater than the contribution of 2793 million euros to the intergenerational equity mechanism Fourth given An increase in income from social contributions is proposed by 11.5 over the budget of 2022 and by 8.4 over the forecast for the liquidation of this financial year It is an increase linked to the rise in the maximum contribution bases and to economic growth Let 's look at both conditions First condition increase in the maximum contribution bases With an unemployment rate of 12,7 the highest in the European Union and after increasing labour costs as a result of the introduction of the intergenerational equity mechanism increasing the maximum contribution basis by 8,6 is a complete irresponsibility It is irresponsible as a further increase in labour costs following the rise in the price of energy raw materials intermediate goods interest rates and taxes is an additional burden on companies It is irresponsible since those companies with problems in shifting the cost increase to prices which are mainly SMEs may be forced to reduce their activity create jobs or raise wages less in the face of the fall in their production margins It is irresponsible to increase labour costs with unemployment rates ranging from 1.7 to 2.2 times the euro area average since 2008 and with a youth unemployment rate doubling that of that area It is irresponsible not to take into account macroeconomic projections such as those made by the Banco de España which show for the period 2022 2024 that employment seems to be losing vigor and which point to a decrease in business turnover and the existence of a deterioration in confidence indicators Secondly economic growth that will boost income from social contributions However neither in Spain nor outside Spain is the forecast for growth of 2.1 of GDP by 2023 Ladies and gentlemen of the Government what can never be lacking in a budget is credibility and it is that Socialists in the light of your actions you cannot speak of credibility I remind you of three cases in 1985 the Socialists passed a pension law which according to their union meant a reduction in the average retirement pension of 21.3 in 2011 the pensions were frozen to more than six million Spaniards and in 2021 the maternity supplement was lowered in the pensions of mothers of large families Nor do they have credibility when they speak of avoiding the intergenerational conflict curious request of those who have left behind examples in their history of fostering conflict curious request of those who have raised the debt of each Spanish since they came to power in more than 6000 euros curious request of those who forget that the real dam of containment so that an intergenerational conflict does not arise is the family because it is in it that we see reflected the values of effort generosity commitment example affection respect equality solidarity and responsibility In conclusion I will recall a phrase that Minister Escriva recently said from the public uncertainty must be mitigated It 's a first step towards wisdom It must now be realized that making unrealistic growth estimates does not mitigate uncertainty that budgeting with deficits does not mitigate uncertainty that increasing public debt does not mitigate uncertainty that increasing labour costs does not mitigate uncertainty And it is that ladies and gentlemen socialist policies never mitigate uncertainty Thank you very much"
"Madam President we are talking about the opinion of the Joint Committee on Relations with the Court of Auditors on the declaration on the State 's general account for 2019 an opinion in which the Government is urged to meet the objectives of budgetary stability and financial sustainability A Government that does not listen or simply does not want or does not know is urged Let us review the general account of the State and see some data showing us what the concept of budgetary stability is for the Social Communist Government First we are talking about a negative net worth in 2019 of 451059 million euros that is we owe 451,059 million euros more than we have a negative figure that has increased in the year 2020 to 579,412 million euros These figures are the cumulative result of inefficiency and irresponsibility in the management of the public accounts of successive PP and PSOE governments in recent years Let us remember that from 2010 to 2019 the negative net assets of the public accounts have increased by 255,330 million euros Second The loss attributed to the dominant company amounts to EUR 37,792 million in 2019 That is while the Spanish economy grew to 2.1 in 2019 the revenue from ordinary management grew to 4.1 interest rates remained at 0 the public accounts recorded a loss of € 37 792 million That ladies and gentlemen has only one name and it 's called incompetence Third A total debt adding short and long maturitys of EUR 1,117,068 million debt that is the result of accumulated inefficiencies of previous years inefficiencies that are demonstrated in the fact that during the period 2010 to 2019 for each euro of GDP growth the debt increased by EUR 3,14 Fourth Financial expenditure amounting to EUR 24 837 million a very high amount as a result of an irresponsible increase in public debt which conditions the rest of public expenditure Secondly I would like to stress two motions for resolutions tabled by the VOX Group which were not adopted by the Commission First Define and quantify the collection required to have an additional euro of effective public expenditure as well as efficiency costs compliance costs and administration costs Pure common sense they add to a situation of strong deficit in the public accounts Monday To study the implementation of the budgetary methodology of the zero base budget with a view to providing greater efficiency in the use of public resources providing better information when making decisions and contributing to the reduction of the medium term public deficit Again pure common sense They refuse to budget on a zero basis because they know that in applying this methodology the inefficiencies and duplications that exist in the State and that they refuse to commit will come to light Thirdly I would like to talk about the Court of Auditors From the VOX Parliamentary Group we have already denounced the lack of respect for democracy which is the pact reached by PP PSOE and Podemos to distribute the Ombudsman the Court of Auditors and the Constitutional Court With that pact we said in its day institutions are surrendered and the defence of the rule of law is weakened against those who are committed to attacking it a pact that gives oxygen to separatists and a government that tramples on the Constitution The passage of time has given us reason as evidenced by the fact that the first major decision of the Court of Auditors after its renewal was to accept the resources of the convicted jolters for the Generality to approve the € 5.4 million It should be recalled that the Court of Auditors prior to its renewal had rejected the Generality 's endorsement and announced the embargo to twenty eight Angolan leaders The worst is that ultimately we are all the Spaniards since the Generality has no money has debts and of great importance Let us remember that in September 2021 the Generality has a debt of 82,936 million euros of which 66,936 is debt to the State since no one buys debt from the Generality of Catalonia Finally we are faced with a general state account with a negative net worth We are faced with political parties that are not interested in analysing the efficiency of spending We are facing a lack of respect for democracy which presupposes the pact between the PP the PSOE and Podemos Ladies and gentlemen by principle by credibility by consistency by integrity by respect for democracy VOX does not participate in the vote on the renewal of the posts of the Court of Auditors Ladies and gentlemen as a matter of principle"
I 'm finishing up by responsibility by credibility by sense of state by common sense since VOX we cannot support an opinion that does not include measures to reduce in the future the amount of the worrying imbalance in public accounts Thank you very much
Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Gentlemen of Esquerra between you and us there is an abyss not only political and ideological but also of values You hate Spain and want to see it shattered We love our nation and believe in its unbreakable unity You hate our Police and Civil Guard from this rostrum you have said that you are savages and that you feel disgust and aversion to these occupying forces In VOX we feel not only a deep respect for the men and women of these bodies but also a huge gratitude and appreciation In VOX we believe in the freedom of the individual in the free choice of language for the education of our children in the freedom of expression in the freedom of religion you in the repression of everything above Today we highlight another of the fundamental differences between you and us If any party puts on the table an objectively good initiative for Spain we support it without blinking without doubt and from whomever comes You pack democrats systematically reject our proposals just because they are from VOX and do argumental contortionism to try to explain their refusal We have shown this on many occasions by voting in favour of his initiatives and of other parties Today we will again give them an example of coherence and support this initiative for the simple reason that it is good for science if it is not undermined by the changes and amendments of other parties We are submitting an amendment since Articles 4 and 5 of the Value Added Tax Act state that the research activity carried out by universities will be subject to value added tax only if as a result goods or services are delivered for a fee All transactions which are carried out without any consideration for them are therefore outside the scope of the tax In paladin roman and so that we understand each other when the university develops research projects without the objective of economically exploiting the results that it can obtain from them but in order to offer them to society as a whole without the aim of obtaining any compensation for them such activity would be not subject to VAT Let them be clear even though they call us negatists VOX has always been supporting science and will always support it Finally you are seen suffering because more and more workers are voting for us and supporting us They repeat it every time they come up to this rostrum and I guarantee in this past campaign in Castile and Leon through the streets and squares we have been approached countless autonomous currant to tell ourselves that we are their last hope and we will not fail them When you come up to this rostrum you are constantly wondering that if any of our VOX Members and a worker vote the same thing who is wrong about both of you I will tell you and resolve your dilemma you are the only ones who are wrong because the workers of Spain including the Catalans have tired of their betrayals and lies Who do you want to vote for To socialist gentlemen who spend their money in Andalusia on cocaine and prostitutes Yes gentlemen the EREs of Andalusia up to 680 million Or Mr. Echenique who blew up the only worker he had without paying his Social Security Can you imagine Mr. Echenique with a company of thousands of workers Or the communists of this country who instead of singing To the barricades in their anthem now sing to the shellfish Or to you gentlemen of Esquerra who promised the workers of Catalonia that they would be better off with the process that they would be richer and happier And Catalonia since then has not stopped losing productive tissue and winning ruin misery and social rupture We knew a few days ago that Volkswagen is taking the manufacture of electric motors to Hungary instead of doing it at its Martorell plant Another success of the separatist administration Congratulations They do n't cheat on anyone anymore Stop squandering on embassies and Mafia associations and devote all resources to research and science although this is as utopian as the independent republic that they want to impose on us Thank you very much
Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Today we attend the last session of debate on the law of science which this government cooked in the style of I like it and I like it that is without anyone And when the cake came out warm from the Council of Ministers ladies and gentlemen it had more holes than a strainer To cover those holes as far as one of them is concerned Podemos tabled an amendment which was subsequently rejected in the Senate removing the tenth additional provision that had been incorporated into Congress and that we are again debating here today a rocking pimping game between the Legislative Chambers and a clebrón that is incomprehensible to the citizenry and that would have avoided having done things right from the beginning Therefore it is important to recapitulate and explain to the Spaniards what the real reality is The first thing and to put it in context is to say loud and clear that science in Spain is made of foxes Despite the enormous talent that our researchers treasure they are ill treated with poor wages VOX denounced from this rostrum the milleurist payrolls of professionals with more than twenty years of experience It must be said that they work suffocated by a thick bureaucracy and that we have a massive exodus of young talent abroad And worst of all and the key we have under financing of 1.4 of our GDP far far away ladies and gentlemen from 2.3 which is the European average and in light years from the countries leading Europe such as Switzerland or Sweden above 3 This is the sad reality ladies and gentlemen and it is neither the fruit of Putin nor the virus nor even of Franco believe me The leaders of this demeaning capital are the alternation governments of the Socialist Party and the People 's Party You have managed the science of Spain in the last forty years and are the creators of this dramatic situation But let us focus on what has been the trajectory of this law Although the scientific world unanimously called for a pact for the science of all political forces this government from the minute one applies an anti-democratic cord to VOX and excluded us from knowing the initial text and of course inviting us to sign it It is fair to say that only one citizen 's deputy Marta Martín had the courage to raise her voice and denounce this injustice He is no longer here today by his own decision but I would like to thank him with all my heart from this rostrum Gentlemen of the Government with these additions you do not silence the deputies of VOX what you do is gag the four million voters of the third political force of Spain there can be no more petty or undemocratic act The Spaniards must be told that this government understands science as a tool for its propaganda It fills their mouths with the importance of science and then ends up as always leaving it in the gutter They already did so with scientists during the pandemic when they declared them nonessential combining them in their homes without allowing them to work In Spain during that period one could reform his kitchen because the professionals who worked there had been considered essential but you illegally and unconstitutionally left the scientists locked up in their homes The Spanish have to know that in this Congress a subcommission was created with twenty six first level experts to listen to their proposals and incorporate them into the law of science some of them international eminences and that this Government did not wait for their appearances to end the Government approved in the Council of Ministers the text of the law without all of them intervening here Once again they trampled on science What disrespect and defach gentlemen But today they again despise science with the decree in which they state that workplaces should not exceed the 27th and exclude for example hairdressers which seems phenomenal to us ladies and gentlemen but forget about scientific laboratories Do you think it 's healthy really that our scientists work 27o with robes propylene gloves lab glasses and handling substances like ether or acetone which at these temperatures generate flammable gases They do n't have to answer us because we know it 's absolutely the same The Spanish must also be told that during the period of its proceedings this government promoted labour reform which jeopardized the future of more than 25 000 researchers Not only did they show a total lack of coordination between the portfolios but they also showed an enormous pre-potence disheartening the directors of the Spanish universities who alerted them at the beginning of the year It must be explained that this Government which says that it never leaves anyone behind forgot in its law about technical professionals management professionals even health researchers and that only with amendments from the rest of the party groups was it possible to correct this unacceptable forgetfulness It must be said that its law does not guarantee investment despite the fact that its media machinery sold the shielding of the financing of science in a bowl and bowl You conditioned it to budget availability for each year a package armor that had to be amended once again to ensure investment in science This law includes improvements but it is not the definitive solution to the labor instability of the scientific world Behind this lies an endemic problem of lack of funding a structural failure that you could have addressed if you had broad sightedness and courage Do you want to explain to us how they will finance science when they do not have European funds Gentlemen of the Government this has been a chronicle of the missed opportunity You had in your hands touching it with your fingers the possibility of putting aside sectarianism and partisan interests and having truly bet on science But to ask this government not to be sectarian even if it embraces common sense is like asking the elm or grapes to the thorn a veritable mischief Thank you very much
Thank you very much President Ladies and gentlemen you are bringing us here today a proposal for a law for a future source of energy very much in the future because it is true that you still have a long way to go at a time of an energy context in ancient Spain where the energy policy of this government is a major waste another They are unable to find a solution that will alleviate the unstoppable price escalation which is leading to unbearable suffering for Spanish households by deceiving the citizens by saying that Brussels should give the approval to the tax reduction when by then half of Europe had already lowered the VAT on fuels by defachingly accusing Putin of being the only culprit of the price increase by not apologizing for a series of measures which have not managed to alleviate the situation not a single word of self criticism gentlemen they are incompetent to announce the intervention of the price of gas with which they intended to lower the receipt of the light of the Spaniards and which has served absolutely nothing In short a new ridiculous one more of this nefarious government But gentlemen of the PP in the successive governments that you have led they did not want to change things either they did not address any structural changes in energy policy they did not promote any connectivity with Europe they continued to shut down nuclear power stations Does that sound like you Garoña gentlemen of the PP He had a useful life until 2031 and Rajoy in campaign assured that if he ruled he would never close it And I already believe it closed down drowned by the taxes and taxes that your government imposed on you It 's been many years working for Garoña 's closure Those of us who have fought for it today we are pleased to have finally achieved it This was said by a politician currently in his ranks in the Senate And what about the rise in fuel VAT in 2018 from 18 to 21 He never retreated again Do n't forget you have a share of responsibility in all of this Look the future goes through cleaner energies is absolutely obvious and with what VOX fully agrees just as evident that the pace that climate fanaticism has imposed on us is excessive utopian and realistic zero and that is why we are paying for the consequences Come up here gentlemen and explain why with similar prices in the barrel of Brent in 2008 or 2011 gasoline cost 1.25 euros almost half what it costs now Tell the truth to the Spaniards that the market is tense to the extreme because they have had the great idea of minimizing refining capacity to reach their longing ecological transition as soon as possible Or explain why we shut down and blow up coal thermals fifteen years before the Brussels demands while the green Germany is developing the coal plants that were by the way dormant and in reserve Here we fly them through the air and there they reserve them That energy creation in the future will be a combination of various technologies is obvious and that hydrogen is going to be part of that set of energies we do not know in what form or in what percentage also undoubtedly is a reality Nor is there any doubt that legislation is needed to move forward and to create a regulatory framework to create legal stability for investors But gentlemen of the PP I fear that you for wanting to move forward have lost all perspective as there is currently no hydrogen market It 's reality And the doubts and uncertainties of the sector are so much that creating a fast and running legal framework can generate more confusion than it already exists today At the point where we are it might be better to move forward in legislation to provide direct aid and economic and fiscal incentives for the development of specific projects production transport storage and consumption facilities and to facilitate the promotion of such projects with clear and unique procedures throughout the national territory In addition ladies and gentlemen there are issues that we cannot share with you The law is underdeveloped Most points are very inconclusive In many areas it is said that it will be the agency in charge that will develop or promote In short it lacks concreteness because in fact there are still many points to be defined and there are very few certainties in the sector The law is a copy of the law of electricity and hydrocarbons and there are many topics such as the approval of hydrogen vehicles approval of installations safety and quality transport storage etc. for which it is proposed to use the existing regulations In VOX we believe that we are at the best time to analyze what is good for us and in general to develop custom regulations for hydrogen in all cases You identify the technical manager of the system Enagas who has to be so for installation transport and exclusive distribution which is supposed to be in most cases private Why Why not allow other distributors for example regional distributors to do so as well They also speak in all cases of green hydrogen Why do other technologies such as the generation of pink hydrogen from nuclear energy or even grey which is much more competitive and today the numbers can come out In Germany I remind you that there are more than one hundred hydrogens that use grey hydrogen For what To develop a market to launch a sector that is still very green indeed and in which unfortunately green hydrogen costs between two and three times as much as grey hydrogen On the other hand in their law they do not mention cogeneration which would be key in this whole process It is difficult to mark the right point of when to legislate but in our view you have advanced and as the saying goes haste is never good counselors Finally ladies and gentlemen in Congress we must be extremely rigorous with what we are talking about You make errors of package and concept in your chapter III They say textually that grey hydrogen is produced from methane and in whose production CO2 emissions are generated No ladies and gentlemen grey hydrogen is generated from natural gas which is not the same as methane it is the same molecule but it is not the same because there is biomethane and green hydrogen can be generated from it Green hydrogen defines it as hydrogen produced from water from renewable energy sources But there are other ways of obtaining green hydrogen such as the reformation of biomethane that I have just commented on or the gasification or pyrolysis of waste The latter produce neutral hydrogen in CO2 which is also green hydrogen ladies and gentlemen Really it 's all about getting fully involved but you 've gone beyond these definitions
Good afternoon Mr Errejón 's party is bringing us an initiative on banning the advertising of polluting vehicles Spain is a leader in youth unemployment in Europe it has an insurmountable public debt and an outpouring of inflation a fiscal persecution of Spaniards who are having a very bad time and who cannot pay the autonomous quota or the bill for light gas gasoline or diesel closure of businesses and mass layoffs relocation energy dependence attacks on tourism the primary sector industry But in the explanatory statement of this initiative they say Combating climate change is the fundamental pillar that must guide the actions emanating from this transformative process The fundamental pillar should be to implement effective policies that guarantee the prosperity of the Spaniards and not the new climate religion that the globalist elites seek to impose those who travel on a private jet to talk about climate change and that everyone buys except VOX We have a government that has incorporated communists separatists and philotetras into the leadership of the state that tramples on our Constitution violating rights and freedoms with the states of alarm and the closure of Congress that confronts and ruins the Spaniards that comes to terms with lies that threatens Spain And you Mr. Errejon are your crutch and accomplice So when in his initiative he comes to say that there should be no room for the use of fossil fuels say for example to Laureano who is early every day to serve his livestock and his land land that works hard on the Palentine mountain thanks to his tractor tractor that works on fossil fuel in case the ecologists of carpet do not know how tractors work By the way I recommend seeing the documentary La España silenced which will bring you closer to reality and you will also meet Andrea who in Soria takes her car to go to the car factory where she and her mother work a factory which will close to continue with the ideological delusions made of green sending to misery young and not so young Spain is closing factories as a result of the 2030 Agenda and climate impositions while Asia wins the race and gets rich Stop complicating the lives of the Spaniards Of course air quality needs to be improved but there is no need for a new ban There is no need for a new blow to a sector that is strategic for Spain His friends from the government have already beaten him they beat him when they attack the diesel when they raise tuition taxes or when they come late in the aid of the PERT VEC the one in which they have left many SMEs out And now they 're looking for a new blow with a new ban Mr Errejón there are many reasons to vote against your initiative Spain is experiencing an economic and health crisis and the priority is not to ban advertising a sector in which thousands of self employed people work which has great creatives and in which we are international references In Spain the automotive sector is the first contributor to the trade balance accounts for 10 of GDP and generates two million fixed and quality direct and indirect jobs In addition stop demonizing because in this sector we talk about manufacturers suppliers distributors dealers workshops components not counting communication agencies and media and everyone is threatened by this initiative It is also incongruent to advance the deadlines set by national and European standards because Spain already has a very demanding regulation and the electric vehicle has a very high price I mean I do n't know how people with lower incomes are gonna do it Are you worried about emissions So work on policies that allow vehicle renewal This will also help to reduce emissions and improve road safety because Spain has one of the oldest car parks in Europe We are not going to allow them to come and tell us how we have to move what to eat or how we have to think nor to tell us what the rise in taxes and prohibitions are the solution And you 're not the solution because you 're all part of the problem And as part of the problem I guarantee you that VOX is here to take away your faces that we do not deny and to work every minute of our life to give back to the Spaniards the hope and the future that you have all taken away from them We will work with our Spanish agenda always in defense of the interests of the nation and rebuild everything they have destroyed sooner than later Thank you
Thank you President The People 's Party brings us an initiative in which it tells the Government to assume its share of responsibility in the energy emergency There is no doubt about that but what about your responsibility People 's Party They talk about tax cuts but I remind them that they govern by absolute majority and instead of lowering taxes they raised it Today the Spanish pay the consequences of their decisions You are responsible for what you call the climate emergency the rise in energy prices the closure of nuclear power plants and you are responsible for your weakness and hypocrisy and we have seen it again with your abstention from the energy poverty initiative that brought VOX to this House PP and PSOE with their climate policies have caused energy dependence and have installed Spain in total insecurity and lack of competitiveness and stability Ladies and gentlemen while you take on climate fanaticism out there the Spaniards are cold because you have to choose between eating or turning on the heating Many do not know how they are going to pay the bill for light gas fuel or feed for livestock as they go up and up the shopping cart There are empty shelves in supermarkets the highest inflation in the last thirty years public debt beating all records These are the most churning things of this Government as Minister Díaz would say Spanish ruined by the climate laws and the harmful politics of the government Spanish more and more who do not accept neither the crumbs of the government of the ruin nor who sell it to the unions of the shellfish Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards want bread not crumbs and therefore are on the streets defending their children 's bread The street speaks we have seen it in the last mass demonstrations They had to be thrown out they were screaming A government that lies impoverishes and manipulates must be thrown out a government that ruins the Spanish speaks to terrorists to whom it calls moderate and not to transporters to whom they call the far right It is a government that wants them to work below the cost price i.e. work costs them money A government that does not lower taxes but spends 350 000 euros in the summer palace of Sánchez and 21 billion euros on the whims of the feminist moquette minister A government that abandons transporters farmers farmers fishermen hoteliers hoteliers taxi drivers bus drivers men and women while giving millions of euros to Chavista airlines shellfish unions and friendly media as well as millions for advisors and ministries for advertising and waste The pandemic has taught us a lot among which dependence on the outside makes us vulnerable Spain must have its raw materials it must strengthen its energy economic food industrial and military sovereignty We 've been saying it for years and now we hear them talking about it Welcome to the path of common sense We have strongly criticized the submission to the 2030 Agenda which impoverishes us and makes us dependent and for thinking differently they call us negatists Non-realistic negatists as real is that the receipt of light has risen and that it is much more difficult to fill the deposit of a family or professional vehicle as real is that energy is a strategic element for the national security of any country so that a nation is free for the international strength of Spain for the development of industry for the well being of the population and for the very continuity of the nation how real it is that PP and PSOE are the same and assume climate fanaticism in the same way and therefore they will have to answer to the Spaniards Spain is first Our compatriots are the first and given their spurious interests and their 2030 agenda only remains VOX and our Spain Agenda His traps every day deceive less Spaniards and no we wo n't shut up or be afraid We will vote yes to the fuel tax drop and we will continue to defend in the courts in the streets and in the institutions the interests of our compatriots At his side in battle every day without fear of anything or anyone Thank you
Thank you Good afternoon Ladies and gentlemen of Podemos what is a contradiction is that you approve a proposal that generates employment and wealth when you only know how to destroy it If the Socialist Party is to be recognized in addition to being a government of ruin insecurity and betrayal it is the government of propaganda Because it seems that they are already beginning to campaign for the next municipal and general elections as they bring an initiative of a sheet where they call for the declaration of support for the Spanish candidacy of Malaga to host the International Exhibition 2027 Ladies and gentlemen that was already done last September when we received the candidature evaluators in Congress Mr PSOE you spoke about the management of the socialist government in Andalusia What management the one that spent the money of the unemployed on prostitutes and cocaine What management the money stolen from the Andalusians The one that left us in unemployment and misery In the budgets of 2023 Málaga occupies the position number fifty between the fifty two Spanish provinces in investment per inhabitant and today they say they are concerned about Málaga In these budgets we also see an Andalusia that falls below the average per capita investment and this makes us think that this government does not bring Malaga and the regions that are loyal to Spain and rewards 1 nationalists and coups
"Good morning The Minister has concluded her speech by thanking the parliamentary groups for their support of these budgets Do you know you 're thanking flotters and thugs These budgets show the essence of this government these budgets show the essence of Sánchez a Sánchez who negotiates with the enemies of Spain who lied to his voters saying that he will not deal with the ETA heirs and today we see how he kneels before them He was not enough prisoners by budget now he surrenders to the heirs of terrorism by expelling the Civil Guard from Navarre We wish to express our appreciation and appreciation for the success of the Benemerita in its fight against the terrorist band ETA A Sanchez who said he wo n't deal with Podemos and there he goes conjured with the extreme left harmful who has brought to this House laws that violate the safety of children and women by reducing penalties to rapists This Government releases sexual predators and punishes those who pray in front of abortion centres Is this the government that defends women No this is n't This is the government of ruin sedition tradition lies and propaganda and you are complicit in voting yes Therefore from VOX infinite distance with this government infinite distance with those who attack our nation infinite distance against waste who end up paying the Spaniards through taxes those to which they force to tighten their belt The welfare state It is the welfare of the politicians of the unions of Sánchez 's friends placed in the Moncloa It is the most lycated government in the history of democracy with its chiringuitos and ideological delusions This is the government against people who only think of power and benefit the enemies of Spain and that is why we must throw them out and that is why elections are urgent Minister Sánchez assigned him a portfolio that represents key activities for Spain because they generate employment and wealth they represent a development opportunity for rural Spain for our young and not so young for Spain as a country brand and we have missed that opportunity You minister recognize that you have a sweet sour taste for the overall result of the PERTE of the Electric and Connected Vehicle a PART that excludes part of the value chain forgetting that the automotive industry is each of the SMEs each of the autonomous ones that watch over this industry And the funds do not arrive today it has appointed the approved LOSS which are the same as a year later they have not yet arrived Minister she has not achieved successful results for businesses and the self employed of a strategic industry It has abandoned them to their fate as it has abandoned the textile and clothing industry the trash the naval industry the metal industry in short the whole industry as it has abandoned trade and tourism Spain has lost an opportunity in one of the sectors that has suffered most from the consequences not only of the pandemic and Putin as they always say but of its policies and its unconstitutional state of alarm declared as such thanks to the resources submitted by VOX It was a state of unconstitutional alarm which curtailed rights and freedoms and banned them from working and imposed restrictions on them and so many have stayed on the road and others are now trying to survive suffering from over indebtedness and do not know how they are going to pay ICO credits or how they are going to deal with the rise in the bill for gas light fuels and commodities because this affects industrial plants hoteliers hoteliers small businesses Spanish families and all those who are afraid to turn on the light switch Minister every day small businesses close in the neighbourhoods more than 11,000 micro-enterprises have disappeared You have spoken of an unprecedented volume of resources and it turns out that the sector has expressed its absolute disappointment and indignation to you The Tourism Bureau expressed the Government 's contempt for tourism Minister seeing the bad figures and the disappointment of the sector do you believe that the work you have done supports you to be the candidate for mayor of Madrid It is a pity that we have the best candidate Javier Ortega to defend the interests of the Madridns against the PSOE which with its climate dictatorship wants to remove cars of more than ten years old from circulation and prohibit access to the center of the cities Where will the Spaniards get money to buy a new car if they can't get to the end of the month Minister the climate fanaticism of the Ministry for the Ecological Transition has been imposed on the interests of the ministry you represent We have lost competitiveness as China gets rich and jobs are destroyed He talked about competitiveness and there are items that have not even been implemented The budgets of the recovery path are the budgets of ruin But I will tell you what these budgets should be they should be on a zero basis to eliminate unnecessary spending and with policies that put families self employed people and businesses at the centre We know how to do it because we 're doing it in Castile and Lion In a hundred days the figures support it yes reduction in unemployment aid to conciliation to self employed people to businesses effective measures to prevent fires protection of farmers more industry more employment tax cuts cuts to trade unions and employers and inefficient political spending VOX promised it in campaign VOX fulfills And we will keep the following promise to do everything possible to throw them out to bring down the government of treason and ruin which opens prisons to pederasts and rapists terrorists and coups corrupt politicians with the passive gaze of the People 's Party It is time to push forward the big changes that Spain needs it is time to raise the voice it is time for Spain to decide Thank you"
Good afternoon VOX brings to this House an urgent motion on the measures that the Government is going to take to protect the tourism sector Yes urgent because since March 2020 the Government has declared the state of alarm recognized as unconstitutional thanks to VOX it has been two years two years since they trampled on the Constitution kidnapped Congress by paralysing legislative activity and curtailed rights and freedoms by prohibiting the Spanish from working almost twenty four months of prohibitions and restrictions that have harmed the tourism sector in particular and all sectors in general They will go up to this rostrum saying that yes they have helped them they will say that they helped them with that royal decree that came late and bad late because they presented it nine months after the pandemic began and bad because it offered only indebtedness and postponement They will say that the royal decree that of the famous aid excluding by the CNAE with an insufficient amount that makes access to the aid impossible and that does not make an equitable distribution And then you will have another royal decree which generates discrimination between sectors and companies according to the community or autonomous city in which you live While they are dedicated to complicating everything not fulfilling their promises there is cold and hungry out there because while the PP and PSOE are in their dimes and direct out there it is cold it is cold because there are many Spaniards who cannot even turn on their stove thanks to the rise of light and it is cold because time runs against it and live it with despair because they have been two years with falling billing rising taxes uncertainty uneven regulations according to who governs two years of prohibitions and aid that do not arrive They were forbidden to work what if they were compensated for it They do n't want help they want to let them work and leave them alone I am talking about the government of the nation but I also spoke of autonomous governments such as that of Andalusia with a Moreno Bonilla who imposes a COVID passport on us undermining rights and freedoms or that of Castile and León led by the People 's Party which also imposes restrictions and where aid does not arrive We said it months ago they would have to have applied a very simple formula which VOX proposed in this rostrum on the basis of a very objective criterion the fall of the billing We demand aid and compensation from any company in any sector that has seen its income lost But of course they have to come and complicate everything and it is such a ignorance that for example in their decrees they have established as a requirement for access to aid that would not have been declared a negative result for economic activities in 2019 without taking into account that in these cases the negative results have different interpretations depending on the investment curve the depreciation strategy and economic projections I speak as a deputy of VOX which is an honor and as a tourism professional and I am told by my colleagues in the profession they can no longer I read your decrees and listen to your interventions and we see that you have no idea what it means to lift a blind to look at a door waiting for a client or to touch that cold door to attract you you do n't know what it is to liquidate VAT or the titanic task of managing and controlling a cost structure be it a big company a SME or a micro SME and the sector tells you and you do n't listen to them In your padded armchairs you can spend another day but for the self employed for the entrepreneur for the workers every day counts That is why we urge the Government to act urgently in favour of a dying sector because we are desperate and are told this by the hospitality representatives in Segovia who said I quote literally that the time is coming to pay the ICOs and we do not have to pay And we are told by the representatives of active tourism in Palencia and the hoteliers of Ávila they can no longer And they do n't tell me just because we 've been campaigning now they 've been telling me for months years But for that you have to step on the ground you have to listen and you have to work Tourism is employment tourism is wealth tourism is a smile Tourism is Carlos and his travel agency it is Teresa who gets up at two in the morning to take his taxi at four o'clock that to which they have now climbed as to all Spaniards fuel they are Mar and Elvira who manage a fabulous museum in Malaga it is Federico with his audiovisual company in the management of events it is Juan Carlos and his food distribution company it is Julio and his consultancy they are Reme and Gema hairdressers it is Carmen and his neighborhood trade it is the whole value chain of tourism and it is obligatory to protect it to protect the tourist industry that contributes so much to Spain because it contributes in terms of employment happiness and image Or are n't they happy when they see a sunset on the beach a sunrise on the mountain or have a coffee on a terrace Look I could tell you about a lot of data the INE Frontur surveys the Egatur surveys the EPA survey published by Turespana which confirms the number of employed people unfortunately who have lost their jobs All these figures which show the loss of millions of euros the massive destruction of jobs and the deteriorated image of Spain have a face and have a name But now what I want as a tourism professional is to send a message of hope to all the professionals who strive every day to provide the best of services I know that this government does not have a plan or if it has a plan it is the destruction of Spain I know that this government is encircling our rights and our freedoms but out there and here there are a handful of brave people who do not resign and that we will continue to fight every day for Spain And Spain are its bars and Spain is its people and Spain is night entertainment its bulls and flamenco our popular parties the beach and the mountain its fortresses and castles its towns and cities its spices and its exquisite gastronomy Spain is the legacy of our grandparents it is the legacy that we will leave to those who come behind Spain is the primary sector it is the industry And it 's not written that we have to resign ourselves and we 're not going to resign ourselves to the policies of the usual parties because now VOX is here and there 's a battalion of millions of people who say it 's okay because they want hope they want peace prosperity life freedom and equality Finished Love does not delight in evil but rejoices in the truth Everything you believe everything you expect
Thank you President Before we talk about the loss of cars let us see where we come from because the deterioration of a strategic sector and job creating sector cannot be understood without the damage caused by this government This sector suffers from a government that does not leave a tax behind It has suffered the consequences resulting from a state of unconstitutional alarm it was declared as such thanks to the appeal lodged by VOX which curtailed rights and freedoms Thus from one day to the next he forced many factories businesses and businesses to close prohibiting many Spaniards from working without indemnifying them for it Many have remained in the way and others are beginning to pay for the terrible consequences of the worst government at the worst time which in the face of its incompetence only resorts to the triangle Putin virus Franco No one is surprised by the criticisms expressed by the sector as to the slowness of the processing of this PART and for excluding part of the value chain from it The sector is going through a critical moment it faces the fall in car sales shortages and strong price increases in parts and components energy and transport among others Ladies and gentlemen it is at stake that Spain has an important role at European and global level but we still hope that this LOSS will be resolved On Monday the minister announced that the government will publish resolutions on the PERTE projects in early October I am confident that this statement will be complied with and that it will not occur as with the special register for LOSS which took a year longer than the deadline set Months ago the representatives of the sector warned of the slowness that the Government was having in the development of PERALTE and VOX recorded initiatives because we understand that the agile channelling of these funds is as necessary as the implementation of additional measures that support the industrial transformation an industrial transformation that must be planned with common sense and not be a crazy race towards the criminalization of our industry and decarbonization with precipitated deadlines imposed by globalist agendas which reduce competitiveness to other countries that are much more polluting a nightly ideology peculiar to the 2030 Agenda shared and defended by PP and PSOE Yes Spain must be a leader in this sector and protect employment but it is not common sense to bend to the imposition of policies subject to climate fanaticism Why do n't you ask the Spaniards what they prefer if their fanaticism is to be greener than anyone else and without looking at the damage that comes or a gradual transition which prioritises the interests of the Spaniards Points of recharge are missing the bill of light is fired the Spanish families are getting poorer every day and from their offices they intend to impose the electric car which is insecure for many compatriots Sanchez will take off his tie but he has put the rope on the neck of many Spaniards This Government has the counted days and should call elections to return the voice to the Spanish people They say Sanchez has a plan Which one destroy Spain They say Feijoo has a plan Which assuming the Socialist Party 's misconceptions does not comply with the law stating that they have no interest in seeing in prison those convicted of ERE fraud in Andalusia 700 million who have stolen from us Andalusians PP and PSOE are more than the same By the way a PP who does not accept our amendments who asks to push this PAST is it that they like to copy It is time to confront the urgent needs of Spain which are not what this progressive consensus says To do this Santiago Abascal does have a plan VOX has a plan our agenda Spain which is not for 2030 to 2050 is for today to regain our sovereignty and the reins of our future so that families are at the center of all policies It 's time for Spain to decide It 's time for freedom and prosperity It 's time for the alternative not the alternation And it 's time for millions of Spaniards who trust VOX to raise their voice loudly because they know we 're going to rebuild everything you 've destroyed Thank you
Good night We discussed an initiative that is quite interesting although it mixes quite a few ideas that seem in themselves different as it speaks of the costs of light and gas of the electro intensive industry of the registration tax of a regasifier located in the port of El Musel in Gijón as well as of the aluminum processing plants the ancient Alcoa These are issues that may seem very different from each other but they have a thread industry The way in which the present group has expressed this even the groups which have intervened in the afternoon and in the sitting also show a fairly clear thing we are all aware that Spain and Spanish industry are going through absolutely critical and highly complicated moments The present is very dark for Spanish industry However and then I will explain myself there is hope In my view on the issue of light and gas the nuclear point of that price of light and gas has not been addressed
The reason is nothing other than the radical and irrational policies of this Government with regard to climate religion They believe that on the basis of these climate dogmas which by the way are imposed by the Spanish electorate not by the interests of Spain but that they are imposed basically by the European Commission they believe that everything is good and everything can be justified Because of these policies that light and gas are being applied they are at the prices they are at So businessmen who have their restaurant know that this bill of light that is multiplying is the fault of the policies of the Socialist Party supported by Podemos erratic and absolutely unbridled with regard to that climate religion Mr. Farmer you have to keep the milk you work with with which you earn bread every day you have to keep it in those huge refrigerators that consume a lot of electric energy if you can't survive and can't carry your business forward know that it 's because of that Socialist Party and Podemos The electro intensive industry is absolutely related to this issue an industry in which at normal times I speak of a concrete example of Asturias which I have been able to analyse 45 of its expenditure corresponds to electricity when around 50 euros per megawatt hour is around Today the light is around 200 euros megawatt hour That is to say what used to be 50 is now around 70 of its expenditure This implies that this industry which is the same as Alcoa for example is no longer at all profitable What 's going on That the industry necessarily closes and the Spaniards go to the street and this industry automatically moves to India or China countries with a much more lax regulation and which does benefit its workers They 're talking enrollment tax Well it 's just that the tuition tax has been increased with a legal trifle
I understand that there are very nervous parliamentary groups but nothing is going to be resolved here today Enrolment tax has been raised by means of a Socialist Party triquiñuela which starts in January All those who bought their vehicle during this year and who did not receive it will wonder why they did not receive it They have not received it because the Socialist Party and Podemos have dismantled a large part of the automobile industry What 's going on That the cars are no longer manufactured entirely in Spain but are manufactured outside and the Spaniards have not yet received them Whoever bought his vehicle a year earlier and received it today is going to pay that tuition tax which has gone up who The Socialist Party indeed El Musel 's regasifier a fairly important energy infrastructure has cost some €400 million It began to be built in 2008 and has not yet come into operation a real nonsense That 400 million euros by the way is about what will be raised more with that increase in the enrolment tax that is what you are told is used to waste it on infrastructures that do not start up to work But I say there 's a future Why Because the Socialist Party which is the cause of this ruin has lost in these last elections in Castile and León the thermometer put on the citizenry 25 of its votes has lost one in every four votes it received in the year 2019 a genuine electoral debacle that shows that the Spaniards are seeing what there is If we extrapolate this result at the national level you would remain out of the 120 seats you have today in 82 seats the worst result of your history So Spaniards calm down because there 's still hope Thank you so much
Mr President in the specific remarks that have been made the VOX Parliamentary Group has been called directly fascist it has been expressed directly referring to the VOX Parliamentary Group that they are part of the far right it has been associated with national socialist ideas and a number of statements have been made that either must be withdrawn and limited or that any kind of statement must be effectively allowed
The Member of the Republican Left has said that the political guide of the VOX Parliamentary Group is the Mein Kampf and has been
There is another reference by another parliamentary group The Socialist Parliamentary Group has expressly said far right about VOX
The Socialist Group has said that VOX is an extreme right Mr President there is a direct reference
Very good afternoon ladies and gentlemen We are dealing with the validation of the Royal Decree Law 12/2022 It is important that you know this ladies and gentlemen and those who listen to us because if only you had listened to the Minister of Health in her intervention anyone could believe that we are facing the validation of the Royal Decree Law 14/2021 because she has dedicated three quarters of her intervention to talking about another royal decree law which is the famous royal decree law of stabilization of the interims which has not by the way served to stabilize any interim in any case to send some of them to the street to begin with We are facing a very complex royal decree law by the circumloquies it gives It uses very complex words for very simple realities and it is actually empty of content because what we see here clearly and we have been seeing it all day is a government that is leaving and a Socialist Party united with We are in an internal war Clearly the Government is dissolving and what they are trying to do at forced marches and with little success is to launch populist measures to try to hang small medals that hold them in power a few more months because they come and tell us that with this royal decree they intend to stabilize the temporary staff of the Administration in the health sector In order for all Spaniards to know according to the government data there is 47.3 temporaryity in health care almost half of Spain 's health workers are in precarious condition and the government comes and tells us that it will solve it with this royal decree law when the reality is that the only thing that makes this royal decree law is to change the name to things You come and say that what was acting personal is now called temporary statutory personal perfect it seems that with that you would have solved it We are told that they create an obligation so that they can only be hired as temporary statutory staff for a maximum of three years which is what Spanish labour law already says which is what the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union already say which is what the rulings of the higher courts of justice of Spain already say which are recognising the illegality of temporary contracts in law fraud for more than three years What do you intend to do with this Change the name to something that already exists But the thing is even better because they say that on certain occasions it will be possible to hire people in precarious conditions only on certain occasions that is when there is a vacant position to run temporary programmes or for excessive accumulation of tasks that is if in an emergency there is a lot of work it will be possible to hire someone temporary statutory Exactly the same as it is now Exactly the same as there is now and I am going to give concrete examples the typical doctor who works in emergencies who has been covering in a precarious way a square that is never taken to competition for twenty years There are a lot of cases Minister all over Spain And this royal decree that you want to validate today continues to be allowed Moreover it expressly provides for this So it 's a shame that you 're trying to hang your medallions by deceiving the Spaniards with the idea that in the upcoming elections you 're going to be held you do n't run away from the Socialist Party or Podemos and deceived you 're going to vote again On the other hand you say from now on consequences will be established for when the Administration violates the law And when we see those consequences they mean that for those workers who are kept in a job in law fraud compensation will be paid since the adoption of this royal decree law not before And what 's the compensation Compensation of 20 days per year worked with a maximum of one year It is less compensation than that recognized by labour legislation for improper dismissals This is neither compensation nor a consequence of any kind
Because moreover the administrations that as they do today systematically contract in law fraud as they do today will have to pay with money that is not theirs because they take it out of their pocket to the Spaniards lower compensation than you recognise for improper dismissals in labour matters That is to say all the health workers in Spain should read carefully the few articles because it is true that they have made little effort it is very brief of this royal decree law and fall into the account that the socialist government is a pure scam a pure scam They lie with grandiose words to hide simple realities Everything 's still the same The violations you establish are not such I mean administrations can keep people in law fraud by paying them ridiculous compensation and trying to hide it to hang you a medal What they do not deal with are the competitions for transfers between autonomous health systems They do n't say anything about that and it's a sector claim They say nothing about the periodicity of the competition of the squares which would solve the temporality They do n't say any of this Nor do they say anything about protecting the MIR system the great value of Spanish health which by the way Podemos and Esquerra who are his allies are directly attacking
Thank you very much Mr President The VOX Parliamentary Group brings a very clear very concrete initiative We only ask for ten points ten very clear concrete measures which are absolutely acceptable to anyone who reads this text from a common sense point of view These are measures which will benefit our carriers and which as I say are absolutely reasonable First meetings as soon as possible with all the representatives of the sector and take decisions in agreement with those representatives and thinking about the good of the Spanish and Spanish families very acceptable Preventing carriers from working below operating costs perfectly reasonable moreover our unfair competition rules already establish the sale at loss as a cause of infringement of the Unfair Competition Act To draw up a national energy sovereignty plan that will ultimately think about the well being of the Spaniards it has the whole meaning of the world To make a change or to urge the European authorities to change the reduced rates of VAT which can be applied precisely to the hydrocarbons used for transport this is an issue that has the whole meaning of the world To promote in turn the reduction of taxes on hydrocarbons we were talking about VAT and now we are talking about the excise duty on hydrocarbons To ask moreover that the application of this tax be suspended on a short term basis it is absolutely reasonable These are matters of absolute common sense In addition to that promote the creation and protection of safe parking for our carriers which is a traditional claim of the sector collaborate effectively so that these parkings are spread throughout the geography of Spain forget or withdraw that announcement made by the Government to establish payment systems on all roads and all high capacity highways in Spain The Government has already announced that it had in mind to establish toll systems on all motorways in Spain and we ask you to contain this measure I think it 's a matter of pure common sense there 's no oven for buns And finally to promote the immediate return of the outstanding amount of the health cent which is an issue that is pending in many administrations and at many levels in Spain These are matters of absolute common sense but when we announce these measures when we talk about these measures that have been mentioned in earlier items of the agenda discussed today the opposing parliamentary groups ridicule us I will ask the Members to keep a little silence please I am obliged to do so to the extent that the Presidency does not say anything please it is that there is no one speaking here
I hear laughter on the socialist bench which is something that continues to impress me I do not understand how in the face of the situation that transport in Spain is suffering you are still able to laugh We have talked about the measures included in this initiative throughout the day and the parliamentary groups in this House have devoted themselves to ridiculing VOX Basically the Socialist Party comes and says to us No it 's just that you 're proposing to lower taxes as if this were where will the money come from From where You Socialists are a true example of the management of public flows and together with you the People 's Party I will give you the details because this directive the directive from which the hydrocarbon tax comes out is adopted in 2003 In 2003 for an idea to be made the diesel was at 70 cents today almost twenty years later we have the diesel at almost 2 euros That has been the result of this directive a directive which is expressly intended as it says in its explanatory statement to discourage the use of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons And you will think logically transport which is an essential element for the supply and supply of all consumers in Europe will be exempt No gentlemen transport is specifically recorded by the rules laid down in this directive This directive states that the diesel tax has to be 33 cents per litre it is a fixed one it is not a variable that today several parliamentary groups have been confused and yet the Spanish Government has set it at 38 cents per litre You 're always more papists than the pope You always go one step ahead expressing to whom The users of the diesel who will already tell me must be the rich must indeed be the most wealthy The question is that Spain needs to tighten its belt because again and I give it the dates in 2003 when this directive is adopted Spain 's external debt was EUR 400 billion And you will say this directive approves new tax rates new revenues that were not before the Spanish accounts are probably healthier since then No on the contrary the debt today is EUR 1 400 billion i.e. the debt has been multiplied by three by three despite all the additional revenue The problem is that you are disguised as doctors in economics and come here to teach us lessons It gives us lessons from the Socialist Party which I shall now speak of and it gives us lessons to Bildu to Bildu The terrorists those who have Arnaldo Otegi and David Pla the last military leader of ETA in their directive those terrorists the parliamentary group of ETA in Congress come and dare to give economic lessons and dare to talk about taxes revolutionary taxes must be of which they know And the Socialist Party comes and tells us Where are you going to get the money Socialists you are a true manifest expert in squandering public money They spent EUR 680 million on the Andalusian unemployed in a single corruption case You can get the money out of here to lower taxes
When you Socialists look at the transporters and tell them that there is no money to make life easier for them justify what you have spent on public money and public revenues Thank you very much Your Honor
"Thank you very much Madam President Today the VOX Parliamentary Group launches an urgent appeal to the Government to the Minister of Transport in particular and the question is quite simple we want to know what you are going to do it seems that the Minister has no interest in the transport sector to solve the transport crisis in Spain the transport crisis The first question to be introduced is who the carriers are In Spain there are around 200,000 trucks providing public freight services Of these 200 000 trucks 45 to 50 are operated by self employed persons yes by self employed persons While the government your government minister locked up all the Spaniards during the VID illegally by the way as the Constitutional Court has declared these autonomous these transporters continued to function and allowed all our supermarkets and all our pantry to be full complete and we had food while you had locked us up Those are the transporters these are them And it is important to underline it because at that time you applauded them They applauded them but then came the crisis of the Brexit the passage through the Channel Tunnel and there our truckers were stuck they were stuck by a diplomatic negligence of their Government precisely And his government to those whom he had previously applauded left them at the stake abandoned in the tunnel of the channel of La Mancha Then a few months later the drunken Filomena arrived and again the negligence of his government caught Spain with low guard Spain took the risk and glimpsed the risk of food shortages There we have seen a first warning of what can happen if there is indeed a shortage Well those truckers those transporters again as heroes fought for Spain and in the worst weather conditions allowed our refrigerators and pantry to remain full And you again stood idly by They 're the ones who gave the bosom do And those truckers those more than 100,000 self employed 200,000 trucks suffer serious problems that do not come from today are problems that come from far away and that have added to that cocktail machine that today we are seeing both the Socialist Party and the People 's Party because do not forget the problem of transport comes from far away And he spoke of the question of security on roads and at rest points a question due precisely to the insecurity of the citizen and the lack of funding of our forces and state security forces that both the People 's Party and the Socialist Party have been feeding for years I am talking about the logistics platforms that operate in Spain by somehow taking away this profit margin from our trucks logistic platforms that actually come from third countries from abroad in those countries operate with tax rules with social norms different from those of Spain and benefit in the end from operating in those regimes and actually billing in Spain And that system has been promoted by both the People 's Party and the Socialist Party I am of course talking about the system of module taxation and cooperatives which again take part of that margin from our carriers and which have also promoted the People 's Party and the Socialist Party that tax system which obliges our transporters Minister to live more of that tax regime than they really do from their work This very specific problem has been brewing for years and you the People 's Party and the Socialist Party have preferred to look away from the problem I hear laughs on the socialist bench it must be that the transport sector causes them hilariousness Sadly the current situation in the VOX Parliamentary Group is only causing sadness and concern Yes do n't protest if you laugh then do n't protest And the crayon of the cake the price of the fuels which have doubled their price in just a few months This issue is also being fraught with from far away because it is an obvious consequence of what its climate policies were of the People 's Party and of the Socialist Party and today we see the consequences of all the problems that you have been avoiding for many years today we see And it is that the transport sector is tired and is not able to resist even one more day because when the costs of the actual transport of a truck are around 1 euro per kilometre the current market prices are around 70 75 cents per kilometre and this is the result of all the problems that I have been listing problems that come from afar that could have been solved one by one and that has not been done Today we find the perfect storm and when the sector goes out to protest in that perfect storm the only excuse that the Minister of Transport and her Government find is that the truckers are fascists that the truckers are from VOX that Putin is very bad and that things are fatal and from there they shrug their shoulders and look back on the other side And in yesterday 's speeches on this issue tangentially representatives came out among others the representative of Podemos a gentleman who comfortably summers in San Sebastián hunts or goes to hunting farms in Burgos and Castile and then comes and tells us looking into our eyes that we have to make an effort for climate change And the problem Minister is that those who are making this effort are precisely our truckers our farmers and all those who are at the dawn of the gift of national sovereignty that the People 's Party and the Socialist Party have made over the years because they come from outside companies and sell agricultural products livestock products at half the price of the Spanish they come from outside companies and provide logistics systems or services at half the price of the Spanish they come from their climate standards and increase the price of fuels which impacts on transport impacts on agriculture impacts on fisheries and impacts on all these sectors And those who suffer the consequences of their energy climate and sovereignty policies are precisely those who work for Spain those who fight every day for Spain those who work during the Filomena storm who are stuck in the Channel Tunnel Those are the shoulders that carry with their climate policies so that then you comfortably sit in your banks quietly in your homes and in your official cars without knowing how much the price of light costs without knowing what the price of fuel is come and tell us with seemingly serious and gloomy that you have to make an effort for climate change when the effort is doing it exactly the ones below And that 's what Minister ca n't continue to happen That is why we tell them that Spain must regain its energy and food sovereignty as soon as possible We must return to the maximum possible degree of control over resources that are essential for the survival of the Spaniards"
"I ask the Socialist Group even if it does not like what I am saying do not interrupt me while I speak please Because you are filled with democracy but when you hear something you do n't like quickly you strike the opposite of a fascist interrupt him insult him and even throw stones at him And that is what has to stop happening because you have to look into the eyes of those who work for Spain and tell them that from now on the effort will be done by you that it will not be the shoulders of the weak who will carry with their climate dogmas That is why we repeat that Spain must return to the maximum degree of sovereignty possible And you laugh and say you want to go back to the autarchy Obviously not What we want is for the measures that are taken to be taken with common sense and for you to understand that our farmers our transporters our fishermen suffer and suffer the consequences of the decisions that you close in the offices And that if in Spain 100,000 truckers go to rest for the decisions you make it is they who will carry with that climate dogma and not you who will continue to sit comfortably in their seats who will continue to circulate in their official cars Keep interrupting"
In short the successive governments of Spain have put the Spanish on their knees and at the dawn of the decisions of third countries of third bodies to which they have not voted and to which they do not control That is why we have to reverse this situation as soon as possible because the Spaniards are suffering and their measures or the measures they have implemented so far are not working That is why Minister we ask you in a concrete and specific way to tell us what you are going to do to improve the lives of the Spaniards And not only on a temporary basis in the face of the current war and the invasion of Ukraine but on a permanent basis because this crisis is not something of today Putin has not decided it but it is something that has been brewing for years So please tell us what measures they are going to take Thank you so much
Madam Minister sadly your answer is absolutely unsatisfactory I asked what they were going to do and what you said was what they did and you say that what they did is entirely satisfactory for the sector and that if the sector interprets it in another way because they read the rule because it seems to me that you do not know if you think they have not read it that they do not know how to read it or that they have not interpreted it His answer contains all the essential elements that the Socialist Party and Podemos answers contain by definition You have spoken of Franco you have spoken of Putin and of course you have spoken of the far right the fascists and so on And that 's your answer because it comes and it tells us no it 's that you are more orderly and commanding from other regimes pointing to VOX Madam Minister it is you your Government who illegally locked up all the Spaniards It was his Government that violated the Constitution up to three times with two illegal states of alarm and a closure of the illegal Congress declared by the Constitutional Court So by order and command you are and you are for that which interests you Because when you do n't know what to do what you announce are meetings committees talks etc. and you believe that sharing kisses and hugs will solve the problem of transport in Spain You come here and you tell us no it is that we close an agreement with the transport committee which represents 90 of the carriers Surrealist either you lie or you lie to them because the transport committee is supporting the ninth sector unemployment today And if supposedly you have reached agreements with 90 of the sector it must be that 10 of the sector is very strong because it is paralysing and collapsing the large areas of Spain So either lie to reality or lie to you but you do n't explain the situation I tell you that today precisely Fenadismer Fetransa and Feintra which are the three main platforms of the sector all of which are part of the committee have announced that they support and maintain the ninth day of unemployment So either lie to them in their statements or lie to you when you come up to this rostrum You say we are perfectly conscious No Minister you are absolutely unconscious and you do not know what situation you are bringing to the country All of Spain can tremble to its foundations for this transport crisis that you have caused And their hugs understanding and understanding will not help solve problems until they take concrete action Those concrete measures which you say you had agreed with the sector had been agreed upon in November and you did not pass the royal decree law in the Council of Ministers you do not need a majority it is the Council of Ministers until March In these measures which you have included there is indeed the indexation of contracts to fuel prices but it is a three month indexation And if you had passed the royal decree when the agreement was adopted in November it could have been satisfactory but we are in a situation where fuel prices are rising day by day On the same day there are increases in fuel prices and you come and tell our truckers that the price will be indicated at three months I mean do you have to put up with them for three months with your pocket the rising fuel prices that you PP and PSOE with their climate policies have caused with the criminalization of hydrocarbons and CO2 emissions With rules on CO2 emissions restrictions which have been increasing year by year since 1990 when the Commission adopted the first plan for reducing CO2 emissions you rather than establishing a secure and stable framework at every year are increasing it every year and you support it That is precisely the problem of the sector which you have installed in Spain in legal uncertainty which offers hugs and understanding but does not establish any concrete measures despite the fact that you are in the government and that you have the BOE Thank you so much
Thank you very much Madam President Today we are debating a motion for urgent questioning by the Basque Nationalist Party which proposes a set of measures to alleviate the situation in which we are at very high energy prices in Spain And I say conjuncture because it does propose short term measures it does not propose structural measures which are what Spain really needs because the energy situation does not respond only to Putin 's circumstances despite the fact that the PSOE lies go in that direction No it responds to a structural situation in which we are stuck for many years and the problem is that the People 's Party and PSOE as well as the right wing gentlemen have forgotten about the workers on the left wing side They forgot those workers in the field those workers in the industry and in the steel industry and the proof is that without going any further last week they had to stop one of the high furnaces in Sestao without the PNV even changing here because they have forgotten what the real reasons are and what the real impact of the measures they have been taking for many years And it is necessary to include in this cocktail the Veleta party Citizens which says here today expressly that it opposes some of the measures proposed in this initiative because it is not frontal enough opposed to CO2 emissions when that is precisely the nuclear issue that has caused the short term situation in Spain And it is that all the climate measures that the People 's Party and PSOE have been supporting for years have brought us to where we are today and today we are in that energy has multiplied by ten times its price What cost 70 in January last year now costs 700 gas has increased by 800 fuel by 25 copper by 45 and this comes from November nickel by 250 maize by 20 wheat by 26 barley by 21 And all this why Because Community policies relating to energy and food all the planning that has been carried out have failed It has failed because its climate policies have increased energy and production to such an extent that it has been expelled from Spain Europe and our environment and we have launched it to third countries on which we now rely exclusively So now bringing barley costs us more bringing wheat costs us more because it is no longer profitable to grow it and produce it here That 's why we have to import aluminum that 's why energy is at these deorbited prices that 's why our carriers suffer that 's why our cattle farmers suffer and that 's why the high furnace of Sestao lords of the PNV has had to close that 's why And you of this nuclear and essential question that has caused the structural situation in which we are not saying a single word because you have forgotten the left margin because you no longer understand what the real needs of the workers are and you do not understand that if we really want to take care of our environment and our environment we need to maintain and preserve Europe 's industry agriculture livestock and transport It is necessary and urgent that we take concrete action on this you do not mention it and Citizens specifically attack it In short what makes no sense is that here in Europe and in Spain in particular we are killing our industry and our transport agriculture and so on when Germany emits about 8 tonnes of CO2 per capita per year or China which is the monster of CO2 emits about 9 or 10 tonnes of CO2 per capita per year You see it 's not that different Spain today is broadcasting around 4 We have sacrificed ourselves we have cut off the feet and hands of our farmers of our industry of our carriers to give it up to third parties who continue to pollute and who continue with the CO2 emission policies that we have renounced and for this we have renounced our industry We must take reasonable measures and not the unreasonable measures proposed here The short term measures are not enough we must take structural measures so please take them already Thank you so much
"Thank you very much Madam President We are debating the section of the General Budgets of the State referring to the Ministry of Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge and the previous speaker Mr. de Podemos comes and talks to us about the virtues of communism and I am impacted impacted not only because he defends communist ideology itself but because he speaks about communist ideology in a forum that includes ecological transition climate etc Communist ideology is a murderous criminal ideology Throughout history and we go back and forth Pol Pot murdered 1.7 million people in cold blood in Cambodia all the men who had glasses killed them for the mere fact of being able to read Yesterday 's Communist Mr. Podemos laughs but you would have been killed in Pol Pot Cambodia Stalin killed at least 23 million people directly and immediately Mao killed 78 million people It is the communist ideology criminal and murderous ideology that moreover has most attacked the climate of human history They were able to dry a sea the Aral Sea for their madness to cultivate cotton in the area they reduced a sea and turned it into a pool of hypersalinity Are those the communists who come here to talk about the weather Those The communists responsible for the greatest nuclear accident in man 's history the Chernobyl accident for operating a nuclear power plant in terrible conditions where in addition to making energy they used to generate atomic fuel for their nuclear weapons A warlike murderous criminal and frontal enemy ideology of the climate And they come here to teach us lessons Do you really have so little shame to talk about here You are the hypocrisy and the personified lie It is important for the Spaniards to understand that if this item of the General Budgets of the State referred to the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge is approved as it is Spain loses Spain sinks and the future of Spain will paint increasingly darker Why Because in the end this Ministry of Ecological Transition does all it does with this budget item is impose and place its agenda on us I 'll explain myself They come here and they tell us no we have to stop polluting we have to stop emitting CO2 because there is climate change in the world and our farmers are suffering But still understanding the argument Spain emits 0.7 of the world 's CO2 Does it make sense that our farmers cannot use their diesel tractors Does that make sense Does it make sense that our farmers cannot grow barley or wheat in Spain and instead we have to import it Do you really believe that what is cultivated in other parts of the world does not emit the same CO2 that is emitted here Does it make sense for Catalonian pig farms to close down to directly import pig production from China Do you think that pig production does n't pollute What happens is that you Mrs Ribera are exporting Spanish production you are moving it to other countries of the world which are the ones that get rich Meanwhile our workers for example those in the Upper Horns of Asturias which are now going to close will go to the street those in our car factories which produce around 12 of Spain 's GDP will go to the street And in return Mrs Ribera those jobs will be located in Morocco Algeria or any other country in the world Our workers will have gone to the street and at best we will reduce global CO2 emissions by a regrettable 0.7 In addition it is important for all Spaniards to know and understand that Spain is one of the least CO2 emitting countries in the world Spain is below the EU average per capita emissions where the average emissions are 5.7 tonnes of CO2 per capita while Spain is around 4 In turn Europe is the region of the world that emits less CO2 per capita and per euro of gross value added in its GDP In conclusion despite being one of the most efficient countries you force our industry to close force the countryside to stop cultivating and in return do n't bring us anything because when you come and tell us about the drought again buying the argument Spain has pulled on average almost 30,000 cubic hectometres of water Those 30,000 cubic hectometres of water on the one hand for the higher quantities of the Albufeira Convention that we passed to Portugal and on the other for the quantities that are poured from the Ebro to the sea will allow us to triple the surface of irrigation that we have in Spain And that Minister could you promote it but no it does not promote it what you promote is to distribute money to your friends through IDAE with grants of 13 million euros while spending on salaries and salaries 15 that is of the most inefficient we can imagine at the Biodiversity Foundation 8.5 million at the Biodiversity Foundation for real investments 14 million Forests Without Borders 30,000 Eurites Fademur 129 000 Eurites the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces 172 000 Eurites So one after the other one after the other you give to the various chiringuitos that I have been able to quickly collect about 37 million euros and instead of favoring our industry our field and our productive sectors what you do is favoring your friends Please ask the Spanish whether we want their nonsense or whether on the contrary we want a reasonable energy policy which is what you should bring us here Thank you so much"
Minister you have made it very clear what you always do The solution to all his problems are virus Putin Franco If one does n't serve him the other serves him Your energy policy Minister is a real disaster Electricity and gas prices are rising in Spain more than in any other country in Europe and the reasons are clear your measures which you are more dogmatic than any other government in Europe You came into charge and attacked the fossil fuels directly You physically dynamite the power plants You explicitly attack nuclear power plants you ban limit and restrict the activity of hydraulic pumping plants probably the most stable renewable and clean energy we can have in Spain The conclusions of all this are evident an invoice of overflowing light And the only solutions they propose for this are absurd a ration chart It had not been seen since the post war period You limit the time consumption of electricity and gas Two of course subsidy which also restricts tax escalation and distorts consumption That in turn triggers inflation not to mention that the foreign neighbours of our country come to Spain to refuel that energy that you subsidize with the taxes of all Spaniards So yes minister please consult the Spanish If you want Greta Thunberg if you want the 2030 Agenda if you want all of its climate chills and light bills triggered or if you want common sense legal certainty certainty and reasonable energy prices because its measures are absolutely absurd and contrary to the interests of the Spanish And you say they 're going to consult at the polls They have already had two disastrous results in Castile and León and Andalusia and I wish them a result in the absolutely catastrophic national elections because in Spain as in Europe it is the time of patriots
Thank you very much and good afternoon We have talked a great deal about what we have been talking about in the afternoon and in this speech on this issue In particular several spokesmen from all political groups have spoken about the cost of light and have said no the cost of light for many reasons Well gentlemen of the government gentlemen of the People 's Party gentlemen of Podemos open your eyes and tell your voters the truth the price of light is so high for their climate policies for all those impositions that come from the European Commission and to which you support for the closure of the thermal power plants in Asturias for the closure of the coal mines For all these questions the price of light is so high and not for various questions in abstract You 're still talking about the very high electrical expenditure Mrs Mallada from the PP talks about electrical spending Mrs Mallada if you want to attack and curb electricity expenditure you directly attack all these issues and all these policies and do not launch or support these smoke bombs that the Socialist Party is launching In particular the spokesman for Podemos Asturian by the way demonstrates an absolute lack of knowledge of how this energy and industrial issue works It says some industries that due to the high cost of energy their expenditure on electricity accounts for more than 50 This is not the case these industries spend more than 50 on electricity because it is one of the main assets they employ for their production system not because prices are currently very high This is because they sometimes exceed 60 70 or 75 of the cost which should not be but 50 is already normal Moreover this is what the sector demanded was the requirement to be recognized as electro intensive an issue that all parties here today have completely ignored You have also spoken of a hard conversion Well it has been hard for some for the whole mining sector for the mining basins and for the industry because the trade unionists to which by the way Mrs Castañón quotes as pops of the mining conversion have not had a hard conversion on the contrary these gentlemen have lined up with the mining conversion The proof is that every day we come up with condemnations of trade unionists from one or another of the main trade unions among others the most famous how not Mr. Villa Mrs. Lastra 's political godfather sitting here looking down You talk about that resilient Asturias you talk about that Asturias that has tractor force you talk about that Asturias that had illusion Well I did because you guys stole it Here the question is that the council of Laviana for example has today fewer inhabitants than in 1950 Mieres the cradle of the Asturian industry has fewer inhabitants than in 1920 Avilés is below the population level he had in 1970 The Council of Aller which in 1970 had a proud population of 28 000 today has barely 10 000 Cangas del Narcea which in 1970 had 20 000 very worthy inhabitants today it is hardly 12 000 And this has been caused by your policies your policies because if it is very ugly to deceive all the Spaniards which is what you constantly do it is even more ugly to deceive your own voters Because all those workers industrialists miners who with illusion voted to them believing that they were going to solve even some of their problems did not know that you were actually the wolf dressed as lamb and that what they did was to close one by one all the ways of earning bread and sustenance but not from them but also from their children and grandchildren And that 's what happens today that in Asturias there are fewer and fewer children left fewer grandchildren left to guarantee that future and this is the key to everything Because the government of Asturias of the Socialist Party and of Podemos Socialist Party that has ruled this ruinous Asturias for forty years is dedicated to throwing smoke bombs and distractions so that the voters their voters instead of looking at those nuclear issues which are really the germ of the destruction of Asturias look at these fireworks that you launch Here we have Mr. Barbon how he launches his bable language campaign supported of course by Podemos By the way the spokesman for Podemos on the Board of the Principality is a Lord of Huesca who supports the supposedly Asturian language You guys keep talking about the COVID They impose restrictions on fundamental rights for citizens to be forced to talk and to worry about these issues rather than thinking about these elements that undermine their future and that of their children and grandchildren And now you are launching this particular initiative which is just another smoke bomb to disguise yourself as nuns and speak with a sanctifying voice as if it were you Socialist Party and Podemos supported by the PP to save the electrointensive industry with an initiative that in just one folio provides absolutely no solution And it does not provide any solution because the Statute for Electro Intensives which was already adopted one year before this initiative was approved in the Asturian Parliament establishes a very concrete barrier for an industry to be considered electro intensive it consumes 1.5 kilowatts per euro of gross value added Many of you will not even understand what this figure represents of course because the explanatory statements and all the issues that the sector has brought have probably not even been read This barrier is the one that establishes the status of the electro intensive and it is exactly the same one that establishes this initiative that brings us all here today by the hand The sector has already said that it is an initiative that is useless it has already said that this barrier that you establish only serves to multiply those industries that can opt for electro intensive compensation funds diluting therefore the amount that will be distributed among all of them And in the end what happens That those industries which as Mrs Castañón has misunderstood consume more than 50 of their energy resources they need to produce will not receive the necessary compensation Talking about compensation is fine especially in this situation but it would be much better to talk about it in another way to think about why electricity is so expensive in Spain why when the price of basic electricity in Germany comes out at 200 euros now that it is in the clouds in Spain it comes out at around 320 euros Why For your climate policies because you have been the adalids of climate policies It was not enough for them to adopt the European Commission 's approach you had to improve it and that is what is sinking the future of workers and industry in Spain
Madam Minister the truth is that you are coming and telling us that the escalation of people in energy poverty is simply because they are now studying Your answer is absolutely surreal The reality is that since 2018 when you came to the government the number of people at risk of energy poverty has only grown It is clear that this situation is solely due to the energy policy that you are implementing because all the substantive measures that you are carrying out produce an escalation in the costs of energy both of transport fuels and of electricity and the only measures you take to prevent this are subsidies You 're talking about the fuel subsidy perfect It is temporary Minister it is not a structural measure which is what Spain needs You are talking about the Iberian exception which again is a subsidy that will be paid through taxes by all Spaniards When you talk about savings it 's not savings it 's deferred payment It 's like you get to the restaurant and leave the bill to duty That 's exactly what your ministry is doing So you are implementing policies that increase the prices of energy products and all you do is subsidize to camouflage these shooting costs and of course limit the reputational and voting impact which is all you are interested in The doubt that arises here is who you rule for For those corrupt socialists bribed by Morocco or by Qatar Sure power suppliers In addition you to Morocco then guarantees contracts to plant olive trees and make direct competition to Spain You buy dirty energy from Morocco In short you do not rule for the Spanish You do n't rule for the Spaniards Its measures are detrimental to all Spaniards So I beg you ask Ask
Thank you so much I have to point out to the spokesman for Podemos He cited VOX 's initiatives in Castile and León but sent him a correction VOX has not proposed reopening a closed power plant on the contrary VOX is studying the construction of two power plants where there was one before So it 's possible that the actual VOX proposal likes you a lot less What VOX is proposing is that two new cycle modular nuclear power plants be built in the former Garoña site which would effectively complement or at least partially alleviate the energy disaster that its Government is causing in Spain Today we come here to discuss an initiative proposed by the People 's Party in which it proposes above all two measures For everyone who listens to us to understand it quickly the first of these measures is to allow consumers with an irregular intensity in the consumption of electric energy to take two contracts so that the months in which they consume a high intensity of electric power choose one of them and in the months in which they consume less choose this second contract In this way they would reduce their bill be more efficient and better adapt their consumption to the bill The second measure is to create new time zones according to the time of the year so that restaurants regalant communities etc. can again adapt their consumption and make their bill more efficient according to the time zones The measures are positive of course The spirit of the rule supporting the tourism sector and supporting the Spanish agricultural sector is positive and we will therefore support it However the measure is totally inadequate Moreover some of the criticisms that have been made so far to the People 's Party are absolutely opportune because the energy disaster in which Spain finds itself is of course the fault of the Ministry of Ecological Transition of our fanatical minister Teresa Ribera but it is also the fault of the previous governments of the People 's Party And let 's explain it very quickly Both governments or both parties in their successive governments have embraced the postulates of the 2030 Agenda Again so that those who listen to us understand it and do not let themselves be confused or deceived for example by the spokesman of Compromís who comes here and shouts in a very unpleasant tone the Agenda 2030 embraced by the People 's Party And by the Socialist Party it is the one that has reduced the generation of nuclear energy and the one that has reduced and eliminated the thermal power plants of Spain moreover the Socialist Party has physically dynamized several of them It is they who tax the diesel and are ultimately the ones who have put all the eggs in the same basket a basket called gas a basket that today pays the highest prices in history That is why Spain is paying the highest energy cost in history VOX proposes that we forget that 2030 Agenda and regain common sense We diversify our options we divide among all the energy sources we have available such as nuclear energy which is much cheaper Let us think that if today the megawatt hour of gas costs us in Spain 400 euros in Germany 1000 by the way the megawatt hour of nuclear energy costs us 60 euros That is what the Lords of Podemos hide from our farmers our tourism sector and the whole industry in Spain that the policy of the 2030 Agenda is the one that causes these so high energy prices And that is precisely what does not attack this initiative of the People 's Group So that you and all the Spaniards understand what measures we are proposing we ask the Government and the Lords of Podemos who are so sure of their measures in our opinion suicidal to consult the Spaniards farmers farmers of Spain do you want to pay those bills four or five times as much as they were paying two years ago Or do you want to pay a reasonable bill for the energy you consume and need to produce the services Look at us look at us Launch a public consultation article 92 of the Constitution provides for this Ask the Spaniards if they prefer their Suicidal Agenda 2030 contrary to the interests of the Spaniards contrary to the Spanish families and contrary to the Spanish countryside or if they prefer to use themselves as far as possible and use all available energy sources And yes when we are 100 green and we can consume 100 wind or 100 solar energy let 's do it but until that day comes please diversify our risks This is the question you must ask the Spaniards and this is the voice that you pampers and socialists steal from the Spaniards For this reason VOX makes a very simple proposal please return the word to the Spanish so that families farmers and industry can speak Thank you so much
Thank you very much Madam President Thank you very much Minister for an explanation that has been absolutely incomprehensible You 've given up a bit of data you 've launched random numbers You say No the tax impact will be of but it does n't specify whether it 's greater gain or less gain and we 're talking about a system that sets tax exemptions It is not clear whether you mean that the Spanish Treasury is going to get higher or lower income You do n't specify anything just generalities In fact he takes advantage of it to campaign You say that the government of Pedro Sánchez has done so much more for the Canary Islands than previous governments something that is not well understood what it paints in this royal decree- law which is supposedly a technical issue and free of political content as you yourself have expressed In short it is better for anyone who has heard it to have the lesson already learned or to listen to us because I think we are going to explain it much more clearly Nor has the representative of New Canarias who has come to pass his hand behind his back been explained much It is absolutely incomprehensible that a representative of the Canary Islands can praise the evil done the improvisation and the exhaustion of the deadlines by this Government and here comes the essence of this royal decree law What none of you has explained is that this rule basically modifies the one established by the Canary Islands Tax System in two of its articles in Articles 27 and 29 They establish the essence of the reserve for investments in the Canary Islands and the Canary Islands Special Area The first of these two tax instruments the investment reserve in the Canary Islands allows companies to use their profits ensuring that they will be invested in the islands by reducing the tax base of these economic agents i.e. it is a tax exemption in all respects On the other hand the Canary Islands Special Zone is simply a physical zone located in the Canary Islands so that those companies that settle in that zone or have facilities in it etc. receive privileged tax treatment But you 've overlooked this These are two very important articles of a rule which was born in 1994 and which have undergone nothing less than seventeen amendments Why Because on a systematic basis his Government and the governments of the People 's Party whenever the deadline for the termination of that regime runs out they extend it but they do so with droplets they extend it in one year two years one year two years keeping the situation in absolute uncertainty So much so that you said today that it is an extensionable regime if necessary that it will be If you already foresee that it will be necessary for the regime to be extended why not do so now Why does it not in this case for the Canary Islands but I say this as applicable to all of Spain a broad time horizon so that companies and Spaniards can make long term plans so that they can plan their investments in the long term The answer is more or less clear yes basically because you have never lived in the real world you do n't know how an investment is planned or what are the average repayment times for investments You 'll say we 're coming to chrispar No we have come to tell the truths that you do not say neither you nor your New Canarias assistants because in this regime Minister you have repeated it several times to date but to let us know who is listening to us the deadline for allocating or committing investments is 31 December last year In other words any company that has an average planning must already have closed down what its investments are going to be as it must have set its targets for the next three four or even five years And you now set up an extension which comes out of the joke which adds companies back to absolute uncertainty Moreover you introduce an additional provision in this rule which reads as follows Please note that this amendment is conditional on the European Commission 's approval of the regional aid map for the period 2022 2027 That is to say despite the fact that Parliament the Spanish national sovereignty approves this rule the European Commission to which the Spanish have not voted have not elected and do not control can still come to amend the plan You have the assurance that the European Commission has already expressed almost complete security to you What is that Minister What company what autonomous what person living in the real world can set up investments plan investments plan your economic activity on the basis that you have been told that you will most likely approve the validation that you bring here today How come they do n't fall for shame I see that he denies it with his head but it is that the situation is unfortunate and you in your verborrhea do not give a single logical explanation that entrepreneurs can serve And it is essential that you understand this especially the canaries who are directly affected by this especially the canary voters of the Socialist Party because what you bring here is uncertainty for all of Spain of course but today specifically with this issue for the Canaries Finally it must be explained that this regime which is very reasonable is justified precisely because the Canary Islands which is a part of the Spanish territory is absolutely far from the Iberian peninsula has great distances uncoordinatedness and difficulty in accessing this core of investment this core of economic activity which is the European Union and the Iberian peninsula That is why this tax regime in the Canary Islands does make sense and it does not make sense the privileged regime of the PNV that regime which only benefits corruption and which in the end does not respond to objective situations because equality and justice means adapting to the needs of everyone What makes no sense is to be favorable beneficial and submissive to the powerful and yet to punish and oppress the most disadvantaged which is precisely what you do by adding as I say to absolute uncertainty and legal uncertainty Thank you so much
Madam Minister for Ecological Transition today I ask you what concrete measures the Government is going to take to ensure that Spain 's Energy Plan benefits the Spaniards The question is quite specific and for this I am going to develop a series of ideas at the same time as the proposals that we have been putting forward some of which by the way have already welcomed you which is very commendable and it would be very good if you welcomed all of them The energy reality in Spain today is devastating because families and companies are suffering a very serious situation which not only affects these direct energy costs but also increases the prices of all products both those that are transported by road and those that are produced by consuming electricity And that is one of the reasons that pushes prices up and down the quality of life and ability and purchasing power of the Spaniards The easiest and easiest example is that the typical daily menu and breakfast cafeteria which previously paid about 700 euros of energy now pays around 1500 has almost doubled its cost And this is the basic cost of direct energy consumption alone but also the products have almost doubled their prices due to the cost of labour thanks to their companion Yolanda Díaz through social contributions In short all the costs of the Spanish production system are increasing and that is by the way one of the issues that push upwards the inflation that is so much being talked about The reasons for this energy rise which are complex and many come almost exclusively from its energy plan A country 's energy plan is a fundamental part of this country 's strategy think that today everything consumes energy The first point of an energy plan is to clarify what its objective is The aim of Spain 's Energy Plan should be the well being of the Spanish and yet you have left it out You only have the 2030 Agenda as your goal Those who listen to us will be asked why we are repeating the question of the 2030 Agenda so much The 2030 Agenda is precisely one of the reasons why energy is in today 's prices The leitmotiv of the agenda very repeated by you Minister and by your entire government is the very famous decarbonisation But Spain has already made a huge effort on this issue the households in Spain are the least energy consuming in Europe I give you the data 0.3 tons of oil equivalent it is a somewhat complex unit is what a Spanish household consumes However the EU average is 0.5 and Germany is 0.7 We are one of the most efficient in Europe But we are too in CO2 because Spain emits 0.33 tons of CO2 for every megawatt hour produced in 2000 and today we emit 0.14 that is we have doubled our efficiency in energy generation and you even tighten the nuts more In addition the Spanish also emit less CO2 than the rest of the Europeans since Spain is around 4 tons of CO2 per inhabitant while Germany emits around 7 and the EU average is around 6 and you ask the Spanish to make even more efforts That 's why we think you should ask the Spaniards Launch a public consultation use Article 92 of the Constitution and ask them Do you want Agenda 2030 electricity bills of 1500 euros diesel to 1.9 euros or do you want freedom sovereignty and Agenda Spain well being for the Spaniards Ask him openly because you Minister are taking all these measures behind the back of the Spaniards This question has not been consulted or included in your programme nor has it been openly announced because you are hiding under slogans the real and harmful consequences for the Spaniards When asked by the way why these prices the price of the price you respond with some clichés the war the virus and Franco on this occasion you have not used it But the question is when do they start to raise prices In the year 2020 minister when there was no war and the virus had passed recovery according to you on uve The other excuse you give is to point out to the electrical companies but it is also not understandable that this is the reason when you have them tied and well tied since countless positions of the Socialist Party control the electrics today through their boards of directors We have Mr Carmona Mrs Salgado Mr Pepiño Blanco Mr Montilla Mrs Corredor Mr Serra etc You already control the electrics Moreover Minister through the CNMC and now CNMV Mr Bacigalupo also had control over the performance of electricity companies If you considered that you were carrying out some kind of bad practice you could have intervened so much so that you have your hands stuck in them to the elbows but only for the good to use them as slogans to hide behind them and use them as excuses The real reason for this is obvious its strategy is wrong That is why Spain is worse than all the others in our environment despite being the most efficient in our environment as I have already enumerated with data The solutions we bring you are relatively simple Minister and we have been announcing them for a very long time Agenda Spain item 13 presented in October 2021 This includes tax cuts which by the way have welcomed you the recovery of energy sovereignty an essential element we must be able to take advantage of the resources we have Minister many or few but we must be able to take advantage of them because something will help or the nuclear issue which you have set in your sights you and all the previous governments by the way This issue of nuclear power has been discussed a great deal saying that it is in the long term We remind you that the central of Garoña which the People 's Party promised to save in 2009 ceased its activities in 2011 already with the People 's Party in government and closed definitively in 2017 with the People 's Party in government Now we have the Almaraz power station whose license to act expires in 2027 there are five years left It seems a lot but between licence renewal applications and fuel applications that time frame is exactly what it takes five years If you delay extending the business permit of this plant you will no longer be able to continue in operation and will necessarily have to be closed You keep closing and demolishing the thermals In Asturias they have already dismantled the Lada plant and have authorized the dismantling of the Soto de la Barca thermal plant In the end Spain produces less and less energy when we need more and more Of course you also talk about an issue that is very related because your leitmotiv is the climate If what they want to defend is the climate defend our waters promote the interconnection of the basins let us take advantage of our water resources Today precisely don Pedro Sánchez quotes without shame the desertification of Spain when it is you who are authorizing and allowing the emptying of all the reservoirs and dams that we have in Spain when in reality we could take advantage of them and channel them directly between the watersheds and employ between 1 and 2.5 million hectares that today are empty in water A simple and easy plan that would defend the climate that would help that decarbonisation that you preach so much and that would serve the interests of the Spaniards not those of your 2030 Agenda of course but those of the Spaniards That is why we ask you to focus on Spain We ask you to accept all those proposals that we have been launching for you both in the Agenda Spain and in the motion of censure that was raised last year where you have a concrete detailed programme that could take advantage of reuse Use We 've put it at your disposal Of course there is the tax reduction on the bill for light which we already proposed to you in April last year and which we thank you for having welcomed But the key Minister is that they separate the 2030 Agenda from their energy plan and put the Spaniards in the center If you have any doubts about whether or not this is what the Spaniards want and need I invite you to consult them The Constitution provides for it allows it and that is what we must do Thank you so much
Minister there are a number of doubts Either you 're terribly wrong or you 're lying shamelessly It comes and tells us that the 2030 Agenda was approved by a public consultation process Who did you consult with The same people who participate in the interviews now with Pedro Sánchez The same people who take part in Pedro Sánchez 's TV show Did you consult with those people It is the Spanish people who must be consulted who will be harmed by the measures that you are taking That is who you have to consult and you are consulted in the ballot box You in your proposal in your political programme concealed all these measures and worse still conceal the direct consequences of those measures Therefore you did not consult Spain Moreover when Spain is consulted recently in Castile and León and Andalusia it has said no to you He sent them home because he is aware that the policies they are implementing are harmful to the Spaniards It tells us that Spain was in a privileged situation because of its low dependence on Russian gas I can admit it but it 's just that as a matter of fact you go and dynamite the relationship that avoided that dependence Its president explicitly insults Algeria flying almost literally the only pipeline that freed Spain from Russia 's dependence and putting us in Putin 's arms so much so that Spain has multiplied its purchases of Russian gas in recent quarters It is a real shame that you dare to come here to say that we had little dependence because if we had little dependence you as nefarious socialist rulers who are have dynamized that independence You say I am proud to be European Like it 's a monopoly of yours Madam Minister I believe that we are all proud to be Europeans and Spaniards and Asturians of course but that does not mean that we have to acristically accept all the policies that the European Commission sends us when they are particularly harmful to Spain to the Spanish countryside to the Spanish fishermen to our farmers I can respect my father very much but when he 's wrong I 'll have to have the critical ability to tell him You seem to welcome here the dogmas that send you absolutely acritic both these European Commission rules which harm Spain as much as the 2030 Agenda which harms the Spaniards so much You speak without indecent of the weather emergency dropping the issue of fires Madam Minister the fires have been caused by you by the disastrous management of the forest mass of Spain which you have restricted to the maximum You have prevented our farmers our farmers and rural Spain from managing the countryside in the traditional way they did and that is why in the countryside and the Spanish mountain which is uncultivated uncultivated and unexploited the potentially combustible forest mass is multiplying which has caused the fires that we have faced That 's the point You talk about industrial energy autonomy I do n't know what your plan would be Minister but you 're getting exactly the opposite Spain is today less autonomous and more dependent on external energy Spain is now more dependent less independent therefore on industrial matters without going further ArcelorMittal in Asturias has announced the closure of one of the blast furnaces and Celsa has closed this summer for four consecutive weeks some of its plants in Asturias when never in forty years of existence of the group had produced such a closure Renewable energy Minister is fantastic but do n't burn the boats Start with renewable energy let 's push as we continue to take advantage of the other energy sources that we have in Spain The day will come when renewable energy will be able to supply all of Spain 's supply sure but until then do n't restrict the rest of the energy sources which is precisely why prices are unstable volatile and rising just the opposite of what you say in your intervention And you 're talking about the momentum of the ecological transition We have already told you boost the exploitation of irrigation in Spain and promote the interconnection of the water basins of Spain That would really boost the ecological transition because what you are doing is putting the Spaniards on the street and if not asking the workers of Arcelor Celsa or the automotive sector all of them on the street for their sectarian and dogmatic policies Thank you very much
Thank you very much Madam President Minister you bring us a real decree law that you have already put a lot of qualifications throughout today but the truth is that you mix it in it which is a rule that by definition is approved for the extraordinary and urgent need of the issues that it addresses matters so varied that go from self consumption to the remuneration of agricultural workers and the requirements of the peonadas to then be able to charge that so called PER passing through the specific regulation of the City of Energy Foundation one of those bars of the Ministry of Ecological Transition through which you channel grants above all for your friends the social bonus a specific regulation for consumers of natural gas and electricity and an adaptation for the system of injection of renewable gases to the system of gas channeling of Spain In short you mix a number of subjects that each of them would require specific regulation and specific legislative processing These are matters so very relevant to Spain and to the Spaniards that they do not deserve a dip like the one you bring us here today Moreover with each of these distinct and heterogeneous points that you address in this royal decree law what you do is to introduce small patches into a system that obviously does n't work because minister you can't pretend to cover the holes in the system with tirites that as a casket you are introducing Madam Minister you have to change the Spanish energy system from A to Z because as Mr de Podemos says for them to make it all public even if Spain had seventeen public energy companies the price of electricity and gas would remain exactly the same for two reasons first the marginalist pricing system and secondly the CO2 emission allowances which ultimately act as an undercover tax and which tax the Spanish in all their activities because these taxes are paid from oil to energy generation or industrial production All the products consumed by the Spanish at the end are burdened by their energy policy and it is precisely that energy policy that does not work You can introduce endless point subsidies here or there help this sector or this other but if you do n't change the whole system we will never achieve in Spain a reliable cost effective and affordable electricity and energy system for all Spaniards Going further to the question these little patches you 're introducing all they do is add a terrible complexity to this system The proof is that of the social bonus of which you now extend its amount only 45 of potential applicants have been able to fill out the forms to opt for that fund How can this be Minister How can it be Why do n't you attack those intrinsic deficiencies that our energy system has and stop imposing patches one by one The reality is that you continue to be obsessed with your ideological imposition You are committed to making us commulgate with mill wheels when the situation in Spain does not allow it Madam Minister I beg you to listen to me and attend to me It does n't really seem like it As I said you Minister created an energy system that did not foresee an alternative if a crisis such as the one that comes with the rise in gas prices one for the war in Ukraine and two for bad diplomatic relations with Algeria You got rid of the spare wheels of that car in which we circulate all the Spaniards and now which has happened the emergency and we have had the puncture you shrug your shoulders and say Wow for God 's sake we do n't have an emergency system And what you propose to us is that we continue to move forward with the folded wheel suffering that situation the Spaniards That 's exactly what they 're doing Madam Minister we have to go back to a reasonable system a system in which the energy mix does not make us depend on one or two energy systems exclusively We need to go back to a system in which hydrocarbons are not as severely penalised as they are today Minister with the litre of 2 euros in diesel Spain cannot work 90 of the goods circulating in Spain are moving by road and that form of transport will not change in the short term no matter how hard you are So Minister I repeat the question I asked you the other day why do you not consult the Spanish instead of imposing your dogmas Why not ask them and let Spain decide whether it wants its system expensive inefficient and harmful to Spain 's interests or whether on the contrary the Spaniards prefer to depend on their energies exploit the energy resources that we have in Spain many or few Why not ask them whether they prefer Greta Thunberg or whether they prefer a reasonable sustainable and efficient energy system Madam Minister please let Spain decide Thank you so much
"Thank you so much Madam Minister in this urgent inquiry I am asking you a question that is relatively simple what changes are you going to make in your energy policy so that it serves the real interest of the Spanish people What changes Because today the policy that you are carrying out does not serve the interests of the Spaniards Perhaps it serves the interests of some lobbies that you seem to be benefiting from perhaps it serves the interests of a dogmatic ideology that you defend but of course it does not serve the interests of the Spanish In the previous urgent inquiry addressed to you you have given quite a bit of information that frankly puts the hair at the top You say Welcome to this debate Madam Minister what debate if you do not allow us to debate You come here fencing your dogmas because you are authentic dogmas of faith Madam Minister you even if you look down and bend your head never allow us to discuss your ideological principles And from them you force us as if forced feeding is about to swallow all your policies to the detriment of the Spaniards As you have been speaking among your ideas you have said we have looked for new solutions but problems have arisen that we could not have foreseen Your whole policy Minister reminds me very much of Mao's Great Jump Forward when Mao found a solution to those sparrows who ate the wheat he threw a plague of locusts The locusts wiped out the sparrows but they also caused a famine that caused millions of deaths in China The Communist Government was defending itself by saying We found a solution but there was a problem that we had not foreseen You with your ideological dogmas are generating the Spanish the biggest energy problem in their history I 'll give you some data The IDAE a small shop of its ministry watered with 195 million euros public by the way whose director a propagandist at his service charges about 100,000 euros a year for spreading the word of the ministry says that the expected prices of electricity for today in Europe will be for Spain the highest in all Europe Where 's your solution Minister You who came dressed as saviors with your policies Iberian mechanism all the stories you advertise day after day How can we pay almost twice as much in Spain as in Germany for electricity How can that Germany that has reopened its coal plants pay half of what Spain pays Simply Madam Minister because they are functioning at a stroke of science they are functioning at a stroke of numbers not like you who are functioning at a stroke of ideology And when you are discussed you replicate with your dogmas quite simple but some fall into the population You say electrical storage Minister electrical storage is not available today on a large scale The proof is that the energy can only be stored in the swamps which you by the way are allowing to empty because every time and this the Spaniards have to understand that a dam opens its gates has had to collect prior permission from the corresponding hydrographic confederation that is from you So if the swamps in Spain are empty they are emptied and we lose those cubic meters of water is because you have authorized it Please explain to me how this can be done for the benefit of the Spaniards You criticise that we are talking about coal but it is that minister when the electricity generated by coal thermal power plants entered the energy mix they brought down the price because in that Machiavellian system that you designed the last energy to enter it is the one that sets the price and the coal which entered the last one by law had a lower price than the gas That is you have tied your rope to our necks and you are the ones pulling precisely from that rope that today stifles the Spaniards which forces you to pay the bill for the most expensive light in history By the way where are your unions Where are those little pomegranates who in 2017 were screaming against a 70 euros bill of light when we are now paying 126 megawatt hours How can it be Minister that when you come we are criticized for saying renewable energies yes but to the right extent They cannot pretend to replace all of Spain 's energy today with renewable energy it is physically impossible The proof of this is that of renewable energy in Spain wind power has an efficiency of around 25 that is of all the power installed in Spain in each hour it is operating approximately 25 the remaining 75 of average is stopped And the solar much less And this Minister you will not be able to change by decree law It 's a physical reality they wo n't be able to overcome In addition to that there are other discussions and it is that the photovoltaic plates that are installed in Spain come entirely from China which basically subject us to the same energy dependence as any other energy import I 'm going on with the argument Aerogenerators blades are not recyclable or reusable When the useful life that they have lasts about twenty years these quotes pile on uncamped on top of each other some try to bury themselves Where 's that ecology you 're defending Where 's that green energy you 're defending Because in the end reality is neither white nor black as you want to represent it reality moves on a gray scale and what Spain needs is a useful energy mix that draws or depends on the resources we have in Spain be it gas be it coal be it oil as far as possible Minister Because if we have coal production when international production suddenly goes off we can control prices using our production Even if we used hydraulic gas fracture extraction we could control gas prices at that time when they are internationally fired which is what the United States does by the way I keep telling you Minister that although plagues throughout Spain with renewable energy plants would not be able to meet all the demand in Spain And even worse this energy also has an impact The mountains of Tineo in Asturias I do n't know if you know them are currently plagued by aerogenerators The agricultural work that was carried out in those mountains can no longer be done That has an impact on our industry on our agri -food sector which you are sacrificing for your religion Like those who made human sacrifices on the altars for their religion you sacrifice industrial sectors of Spain for your religion Moreover the marine wind turbines that have been installed have proved to make the fishing activity in its surroundings totally incompatible Again an industrial sector that of artisanal fishing which by the way for you should be eco friendly fully defendable that you are sacrificing for your religion In short it 's not all as green as you paint it We must once again defend that Spain depends to the extent possible on its own resources Besides minister I think that 's what the Spaniards want The Spaniards are not willing to pay the record bills for you to put an Agenda 2030 medallion on your chest they are not The Spanish want to ensure the interests of the Spanish always within reason but they want to be able to survive And the proof that in the background you also care about the opinion of the Spaniards is that their Correspondent of Podemos the other day was plotting here in Congress a circular graph according to which the very large majority of Spaniards have a kind of anxiety or climate anxiety which in theory would support their dogmatic policy Well Minister if you 're really interested in the opinion of the Spanish why do n't you ask them Why do they not open a public consultation supported by article 92 of the Constitution on essential political and economic issues of the nation which is by the way what the Constitution says Why do n't you open that consultation with all the guarantees Ask the Spaniards if they want Greta or if they want to depend on themselves if they want their climate insanities with unobstructed electricity prices or if on the contrary they want to live in a state with reasonable certainty Why do n't you ask Why Open that consultation Or go up here and explain to the Spaniards looking them in the eye why do n't they want to ask them I suspect that it is because you know that the Spaniards are reasonable and want a reasonable policy not the dogmatic policy that you propose And if not go and ask the neighbors of La Robla the neighbors of Langreo or the neighbors of Soto de la Barca in León and Asturias thermal plants opened in the forties sixties and seventies which today have the most expensive energy in history and moreover they have no work in their regions because of their fault Thank you so much"
Madam Minister you are so dogmatic that you become genuine and good heirs to the Spanish Socialist Workers Party which has a tradition in your dogmas and in supporting the imposition of ideas
Minister your policy is so disastrous that it jumps to the alarms of the Congress of Deputies In your dogma minister as good heirs of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party you come with the lesson learned you have not stopped repeating I think up to seventeen times I have counted a Spanish card You repeat as a parrot the four ideas that draw you from the ministry The reality is that you are absolutely out of the world Minister I did n't say we had to grab the coal I did n't say You come twist the words and try to bring the arguments closer to your convenience Minister Spain and the Spanish need a prudent prudent energy mix Now we are faced with a situation that you described very well when you said that we depend on a single gas supplier that is Putin you are absolutely right and that is the policy of the European Commission and its successive governments in Spain That 's really the problem We cannot depend on a single supplier We need to diversify our energy sources as much as possible Spain has gas reserves to supply for forty three years and you in your ecological transition law even forbids exploring them So do n't come here and tell us Chinese stories because you are actually Chinese that you want us to have energy independence of any kind because the technology with which photovoltaic energy is generated comes from China energy dependence and the systems with which electric energy is generated by aerogeneration also have their ecological glues But you prefer to erase them because you dogmatically cling only to those two possible sources of energy The reality is that Spain and the Spaniards go on a boat all together and you for some lofty but dogmatic idea convinced us to burn or throw into the water all the lifeboats and suddenly something that was not in your schemes has caused that boat to sink What 's the surprise That Spain has no lifeboats because you carried out an energy policy for years absolutely irresponsible We must Madam Minister return to common sense we must Madam Minister rely on as many sources as possible that is diversification And if those sources can be extracted in Spain let 's do it but do n't close yourselves in the band for as I said mere ideology You 're talking about agriculture Madam Minister you in the CAP have established the obligation to receive European funds to put land on a beard They 've taken us to medieval farming techniques And you intend to tell us that we are old At the very least your Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge is medieval and that Minister runs counter to the interests of the Spanish You 're talking about swamps being in historical minima Madam Minister because you have authorized each and every one of the empty ones that have been produced all of them and this is important for the Spanish to understand and for you to stop lying to the Spanish Therefore please Minister prepare in accordance with Article 92 of the Constitution a public consultation on whether the Spaniards want their strategy harmful to the interests of Spain or whether on the contrary they prefer a reasonable strategy Renewable Yes but to the right extent and with patience because as much as you tighten the accelerator to the renewables what is going to happen is that the Spaniards are choking because we do not have the capacity today to assume the strategy that you intend to impose on us Please ask and let Spain decide whether it wants its climate crazy or wants common sense reasonable energy prices energy available to all Spaniards and energy that depends on ourselves Ask the Spaniards Thank you so much
Thank you so much Very good afternoon now I will intervene a little quickly because we have many issues to deal with that are relatively complex We are talking about the validation of a real decree law presented to us by the Minister of Ecological Transition which is a complex decree of those who mix barbecues with merinas as always does the Socialist Party they make a very complex cocktail with measures ranging from an extension of the deadlines to request an exemption in the obligation to pay certain commissions and financial interests they give an extension by the way because the system created by the Socialist Party is so highly complex and bureaucratic that not even 2 of potential applicants have been able to fill out the forms that is they give an extension for their own cogeneration to the question of cogeneration It is important that we all understand what cogeneration is a technology that generates heat and with that heat that it produces it also generates electrical energy It is very good for those industries that need heat such as the paper industry or the ceramic industry They put in a cogeneration plant they produce their heat they also produce electrical energy that they convert to the system and sell it in a very concrete regulated system and so they pay for a part of that heat that they need It is a very efficient system and works very well but it has a problem that the Socialist Party invents a mechanism to subsidize gas and excludes cogeneration plants What 's wrong with this It 's priceless What happens when they 're out of price They have to shut down the cogeneration plant The minister in an absolutely incomprehensible speech in which of course mixes concepts of one type and another does not tell us that when a cogeneration plant closes it closes the industry to which this plant feeds Thus it has happened that this summer they have gone to Castellónquinientos and peak workers to the street because of your fault minister In Asturias they are depending on a thread in the area of Navia two hundred and peak jobs because of your fault minister In Pontevedra there 's a trash can that 's about to close Finally they put cogeneration into this royal decree and also put a VAT rebate on the gas bill but as a previous spokesman has said they do not put a rebate on the butane candy which is the most basic good of these gas related products They do not include it that must be rich and there the VAT is not reduced The reduction in VAT brought to us by the Government is a real insult because it proposes a reduction in VAT for October November and December Is it not going to be cold on January 1st On 1 January there is no longer a problem that is the VAT reduction is until 31 December and from 31 December everything is perfect And it is that we find that the Government is covering its cods with new cods with new cods and with new cods Always with temporary resolutions and small patches instead of attacking the substantial issue instead of solving the problem What 's the problem The problem Minister is that you and the previous governments have thrown us into a suicidal energy policy for thirty years We 've put all the eggs in one basket and now all of a sudden that basket is broken That basket is gas and renewables Mr. De Podemos postin ecologist denies with his head Now I 'll explain to you what Podemos proposes Madam Minister we have thrown ourselves into an energy race in which we have made ourselves dependent on one product What happens now That this product weakens and therefore Spain enters into crisis What does VOX propose For VOX proposes energy sovereignty which in all we can Minister we depend on ourselves From ourselves much or little but if we can take a little advantage of the energy we have here let 's take advantage of it And the Lord of Podemos comes and tells us his battles and his films and says renewable only renewable and nothing but renewable and the gas is fatal And it shows me a survey Who answered that survey He says that ninety six percent of young Spaniards What young Spaniards Who answered that The slums that chase you around all day Who voted that Greta Thunberg whining Mehan stole childhood Greta Thunberg who has lived a systematic life of luxury These people vote for those issues Who voted that Those young girls who said chickens were being raped by cocks Those are the ones who voted for Podemos 's crazy poll Yes yes it teaches me a cheese rosita by the way of the color of Podemos The reality gentlemen is that Spain has embarked on a crazy career in its energy strategy You speak gentlemen of Podemos of renewable energy which is very good but it is that for all of us to understand each other Spain has an installed wind power of around 30 gigas and in the last year there have been six Spain has a solar power of around 20 gigas and in the last year there have been an average of 4 Why Because the sun does n't shine twenty four hours a day and the wind does n't blow twenty four hours a day What happens when the wind does n't blow and the sun does n't shine That we need what is called a back up energy and thank you or because of you the only back up energy that Spain has today is gas Because of him We used to have coal we had a good nuclear plant and we had hydraulic power which you do n't like either In short we had many cards in our deck we could play according to which one had a better or a worse price but because of their strategies Socialist Party and We Can we are totally sold That is why if a community of standard owners of Spain which by the way are outside their gas mechanisms that is the Spanish families the Spanish little one on foot are outside their gas subsidy mechanisms which only apply to the industry which is not bad but apply it to everyone it was paying about 200 euros per floor of community cost it has now been put at around 400 euros The cost to families has almost doubled for energy and I am talking about the typical standard community in Madrid that has a heating agas heating that by the way was previously coal and you forced to change the gas putting them in front of this sword of Damocles that is now going to cut off their heads In short like so many times the government places a hook a trap for the Spaniards and puts a small bait on it Minister stop cheating on Spain and please take the necessary steps to resolve this crisis Get us out of the marginalist market just like they 're going to get Spain out of the Energy Charter Convention Thank you so much
Thank you very much Mr President The Group of the European People 's Party is bringing us an initiative that announces seemingly sharp support for Spanish industry and a very important part of this initiative does have an acceptable content we could say that 75 of the initiative but another 25 is totally unacceptable and I will explain This 25 which is a full section of the initiative is entitled Protocol for the decarbonisation with capitalization of the de of the Spanish industry And we must start by asking ourselves if we like industry if we want Spain to have a strong industry it is important that we all ask ourselves because although it seems like a pergrullada the answer in both parties of the alternation is probably not or at least not so much and I will explain myself The climate issue and energy are closely related as everyone knows Indeed energy is one of the industry 's main inputs as well as having a strong impact on the climate issue as the industry emits the so called CO2 and I explain myself CO2 costs are an administrative cost To get an idea from those who listen to us a steel producing steel company in Spain will sell every tonne of steel about 700 euros and will have to pay for its CO2 emissions up to about 132 euros Do you guys realize that They represent approximately 15 of the final product price of CO2 emissions regardless of the costs of CO2 included in energy production We 're still talking about gasoline diesel and so on The State imposes taxes representing 50 of the final price of petrol and diesel If there is now petrol at 2 euros one euro is taken directly by the Administration between VAT excise duties excise duties on the value added of the product etc And yet they attack these forms of energy and beat other potential forms of energy that we could have in Spain Think about fracking oil in the Canary Islands nuclear energy etc And why do they do it Because they do n't like the industry so much The reality is that all they are doing is putting the industry one after the other and the most obvious example we have in regulating CO2 emissions to car production The European Union drew up a first regulation in 2007 In 2009 they tighten and demand fewer emissions punish them more another regulation In 2011 another in 2015 another in 2017 another And in 2021 with the approval of the Fit for 55 plan they ended up giving the industry the blow of grace All this within these protocols for the decarbonisation of industry that the People 's Party introduces in this initiative which supposedly seeks to support industry You 'll think should CO2 emissions be moderated Of course we must be moderated of course but what makes no sense is what they are doing in the alternation of parties because they have both done so whenever they have ruled You see that from 2007 to 2021 both have ruled and both have been accentuating the demands for our industry and the situation is that the industry is disappearing in Spain You yourselves gentlemen of the People 's Party introduce measures that wear it down and attack it in initiatives that you supposedly intend to support because you have abandoned the workers Both are traitors they have abandoned the workers they have abandoned the industry and they have abandoned the sector The proof is that all milk production in Spain is disappearing precisely because of energy costs Fisheries in Spain are in danger of extinction precisely or among other things of energy costs Let us not talk about the steel industry or the car industry In short industry is in danger of extinction by the policies that you two traitors have been imposing one after the other And today the People 's Party to supposedly support the industry introduces a new twist of thread to these policies
that precisely harm the industry That is while with one hand they slap the industry in the back with the other they put the shackles on their feet to prevent it from moving forward So if you accept that amendment in which we propose that you return to the reasonable path we will be able to support your initiative otherwise we will remain the only alternative for industry in Spain Thank you so much
Thank you very much for your reply Minister You have Minister the most expensive government in history not a very expensive one not a rather expensive one the most expensive one in history You have more ministers than ever in the history of Spain You have higher burdens within each ministry than ever before in the history of Spain So much so that they have even been allowed to create general directions for close friends of the President of the Government they have been allowed to place at the head of the few public enterprises that still have their cabinet heads their party partners so much so that these public enterprises have a much more complicated financial viability In this situation where you are squandering spending and throwing away in the end the money of the Spanish people because you have also increased the budget of each of the foundations cooperation agencies etc. in the Spanish State you have increased the budget of all of them in this situation of unbridled and uncontrolled spending Spain is facing a very complex situation an increase in interest rates with a debt that you have left us of 120 of GDP a reduction in family savings a reduction in the general income of the Spanish people who are facing a growth of only 0.2 compared to an inflation of 10 that your Government is leaving us of course with record energy prices fuels gas etc Therefore Minister I ask you are you going to reduce that unproductive expenditure of the state in order to actually devote the money to the essential issues of the Spaniards Think about pensions the deficit continues to increase social security the deficit continues to increase as well So I ask you Minister stop spending on nonsense stop spending on marketing stop paying salaries to your friends and please dedicate the money that the Spaniards pay with a lot of effort to the really important things and to those that effectively guarantee the equality of all the Spaniards please
Thank you very much This afternoon we discussed an initiative that raises us Republican Left of Catalonia which is like so many other initiatives on the left a lure to try to attract and empathize with a youth that is getting more and more far between their fingers She is being defended by a very young Member who has never contributed in her life who has no experience in the world of work and who in a way has only been drinking from the honeys of politics like some other Members or 'MPs we find above all on the bench of the left We even find those Members who have never lived in the real world who have only lived in the political world on the government 's blue bench And those political representatives who have never lived in the real world are precisely those who try to deceive and attract young people with those policies that they like so much to the left A minor left at least in the mental sense of the word comes to try to deceive young people with proposals such as vote since the age of sixteen and use narcotics with the legalization of Mr Errejón 's cannabis the only proposal from the left that today is thrown at young people However they systematically deny youth their real options for development They prevent them from forming a family they prevent them from working by closing the industry and closing the sources of income for young people and they prevent them from forming by deteriorating education both at school and at university level Because where the left controls governments education sinks That is what they do systematically and it is important that young people listen to it Because what the left wants is a manipulated and manipulated youth Because what the left wants is a youth that is submissive and closed silent and silent as the Lords of Commitment want with those young people who were sexually exploited and who are not allowed to speak because that would be defending the youth precisely to attack those unacceptable behaviors that truncate the future of the youth in Spain and that is exactly what the left does not want That 's why they only throw sophisms sophisms deceptions and hooks in the hope that the youth will pick up and then hook up That 's all they do What Spain needs is work it 's cheap energy it 's a way of life and it 's affordable housing for families and that 's exactly what the left is attacking and destroying Because since the left governs in Spain companies close every day and if not tell the automotive sectors in Catalonia which every day have less future and less prosperity in their hands The only future that this left offers to young people is the subsidy and the gifted education if you suspend and if you do not strive we will approve you the same if when you reach adulthood you do not get work do not worry we subsidize you but yes it continues to take us That is what you want and that is precisely what we must prevent We need a critical youth a youth who dares to dispel that consensus that promises that everything will be free and we need a responsible public administration a public administration that provides means of education that facilitates those energy systems that provides official shelter and that protects the large families of Spain so that youth can prosper And of course that it defends industry that it defends the countryside and that it defends agriculture because if not all young people in that abandoned rural Spain will be forced to emigrate to the big cities To this day that left no longer allows the exploitation of the rural environment no longer allows them to hunt and no longer allows them to even approach their forests even if they commit crimes against mother nature Gentlemen of the left wake up stop lying to our youth and tell the truth effort work and a responsible administration and politicians who know what they are talking about And here I say to all those young people from Spain who listen to us Who today supports this initiative The CUP those who burned containers in Barcelona Esquerra Republicana those who threw stones at the State Security Forces and Corpses Bildu the ETA heirs who put bullets in the back of our young people the BNG which proposes to tear down the bridges that connect Galicia with Spain and of course and as it could not be otherwise Podemos who comes and defends Isa Serra today in this initiative who was convicted for kicking a policeman Young people from Spain these do not defend your interests work study and demand that responsible politicians defend Spain and that they defend our institutions that they defend education and that they defend of course our industry our field and work that is the real future of young people in Spain Thank you so much
Very good afternoon I will try to be very brief and quickly explain the initiative we have put forward We are debating a motion for urgent interpellation that is it comes from an interpellation that I raised last week with the Minister of Ecological Transition the Minister of Energy I asked her a number of questions in my opinion of absolute common sense and she answered a little with her political agenda and of course she did not answer any of the questions I asked her In this motion today we will vote on ten points proposed by VOX which are of absolute common sense We are going to ask you to vote separately so that each of the parties in this House has to get wet in each of these proposals and so the Spaniards who listen to us and who see us can hold each of these parties to account As an introduction it is important that we all know something that is palpable in the street and palpable in the environment Spain and Europe but today in this House we are concerned with Spain are in a situation of energy also in others but above all in energy critical We are paying the most expensive prices in the history of energy and we must ask ourselves why For many years there has been a policy in Europe and in Spain too of centralising the types of energy of de-diversifying the sources of energy used in Europe We had coal oil nuclear energy gas hydraulic both pumping and flowing solar and wind all this energy mix allowed us to diversify When it was convenient to focus the shot more on one and when on other occasions it was expensive on the other we focused on the other With this mixture we kind of survive For almost 30 years however we have been imposing what is now called the 2030 Agenda which is a strategy by which we are going to discard a number of energy sources including coal oil and nuclear and we are going to focus only on renewable energies What 's going on That when the wind does n't blow or when the sun does n't shine we have no energy What are we forced to do To burn gas because we have knocked down our thermal power plants and we have been shutting down our nuclear power plants and gas is at historical maximum prices For several issues among others because the main supplier is Russia which is progressively closing our tap and rising prices In this situation where we find those who get kicked in the ass of that supposedly green policy of that policy of focusing only on some types of energy it is the Spanish families the Spanish industry all the Spanish workers who see how they are losing their jobs or how they care about the products they buy every day to survive And this policy was precisely motivated by those who are now benefiting from it We have discovered that these green NGOs among others that of the spokesman for Podemos Mr López de Uralde president of Greenpeace Spain were financed by whom For Russia Surprise Europe 's main gas supplier It has all the meaning of the world Turns out that nuclear campaign No thank you 'remember it was financed by the Gulf countries the world 's leading oil producers and exporters Could you have known Obviously yes It was clear that they were directing European energy policy according to the interests of a few And the injured are the Spaniards also all Europeans but today we are concerned with the Spaniards As Russia hired nothing more and nothing less than a German Chancellor Prime Minister hired by one of the German oil companies and hired by one of the German gas companies gentlemen the real lobby led to its fundamental state Greta Thunberg receives precisely funding and support from lobbies who do not respond to the interests of the citizens and that 2030 Agenda which is being imposed does not respond to the interests of the Spanish but responds to the interests of not knowing who and who moreover refuse to reveal we have to give a complete turn to the energy policy of Spain That is why we bring to Congress today ten very simple measures of absolute common sense The first ask the Spaniards which prefer Reasonable energy prices or Greta Thunberg What do you prefer If as you say in VOX we are madmen and negatists and we are alone that referendum that you will convene will win it They 'd take our minds away from us Do it I am very afraid that the Spaniards will say no to Greta Thunberg ask common sense and ask for freedom Please second draw up a rational contingency plan for crises such as the one we are experiencing a plan b If the price of gas on which we depend and with which we produce between 20 and 30 of Spain 's energy continues to fire what are we going to do We need an emergency plan Third sovereignty It is clear that we are not going to be completely autonomous but let us try to be as far as possible as far as we can in order precisely to avoid depending on the influence of third parties Fourth step repeal climate laws It is very simple they focus on the interests of the Spaniards and not on the interests of their lobbies not on Gazprom 's interests not on Greta Thunberg 's interests not on Gerhard Schröder 's interests Focus on the interests of Spain Spanish industry and Spanish workers Establish a transitional framework to freeze the rise in CO2 prices Any industry that emits CO2 either to generate energy or to produce any property has to pay fees for that CO2 emission and each year these fees are charged by law Parallel Parallel I 'm telling you set up a transitional system In the meantime whatever they collect from CO2 dedicate it to lowering the bill do not do as now that they get stuck in the pocket for their chiringuitos In short we bring you a total of ten measures of absolute common sense
Thank you Good afternoon We are debating a motion that follows a very simple urgent inquiry in which we basically propose four questions four very clear points which we also call for separate votes so that each of the parties in this House can be portrayed The points in short ask for the following First we ask that since energy policy has a very serious and essential impact on the lives of the Spaniards on the well being of the Spaniards of the families and of the industries the Spaniards be consulted if they want the government to continue with an energy policy that is really disastrous and I think I am quite objective for the economic and industrial question of Spain Secondly we call on the Government to implement all possible efforts whether it is collection of those new taxes that are being invented every day or CO2 collection that it applies any of these collections to carry out a substantial reduction and in all possible elements of the bill of light that directly impact the well being of the Spaniards and our industry Thirdly we call for the removal of the absurd ban that has been included in the climate change law not only to exploit our natural resources but also to explore the potential existence of natural resources on Spanish soil this is absolutely absurd and has an absolute correlation with the price we pay for energy You think that in the United States since you have exploited your own natural resources oil and gas you have seen a substantial reduction from both Why Because when prices rise on the international market they use their own resources Ultimately the exploitation of own resources serves as a buffer to avoid international price fluctuations Fourthly we call on the Government to recover that nuclear policy which is really essential for Spain Nuclear energy is an energy that provides a stable mattress a constant supply of energy that serves where appropriate both to store it by pumping water and for consumption once again constant in all the slots of the day Spain had a nuclear policy that allowed to expand the nuclear map that we currently have but both the PP and the PSOE have been restricting reducing it and even now in the potential renewals of licensing for the operation of nuclear power plants the PSOE is refusing to do so These are perfectly possible issues that require only political will And I am no longer talking about expanding the nuclear fleet which is also possible because in each of the nuclear plants that are located in Spain not in all but in almost all there are areas to install additional reactors These are areas that are already connected to the network and already have the necessary water supplies to cool Again it would only take a small investment in these nuclear power plants because the main thing which are expropriations permits concessions and connections to the network is already done Only political will would be needed and that does not exist We ask those four questions They 're simple By the way as far as the central of Lemoniz is concerned we see that neither the Basque Nationalist Party nor the Philo Etarian Party are present here
Anyway It 's important that everyone listens to it There is a planned plant the foundations of which were planted began to be built even the refrigeration had been built which was a cooling through sea water in Lemoiz Basque Country and by political pressures that construction was stopped All the investment had already been made millions thrown into the sea These are four very specific points to ask the Spaniards to lower the bill for light to eliminate the absurd ban on exploring and exploiting our natural resources and to recover and maintain the nuclear fleet we have in Spain These are very concrete and very simple requests I think that all the Spaniards who listen to us from their homes will agree with them and it is important that you understand that if the Socialist Party and Podemos vote against these four points is not for the well being of the Spaniards it is not because they believe that you Spaniards will be better off You do not believe that you will live better with or without these four points if you vote against this if you refuse to consult them if you refuse to lower the bills of light if you refuse to eliminate that absurd prohibition of exploiting natural resources if you again refuse to recover and maintain that plan and nuclear park in Spain is only for one reason for this ideological dogmatic and almost religious agenda called Agenda 2030 All the Socialist Party and Podemos want is to eliminate CO2 emissions They have decided that CO2 is the devil and as a good devil with religious gestures they try to drive it out of our lives They are not aware that these CO2 emissions are necessary to produce the cement that builds our houses to produce the steel that supports the foundations of our buildings to produce the electrical energy with which we heat ourselves even when we use the gas with which we heat the water of our houses CO2 is an element that today is irreplaceable unless a terrible effort is made By whom Who 's gonna have to carry out that terrible effort The Spaniards You a farmer in the province of Lérida will not be able to pull out your tractor Do you have a pig farm in Tarragona or in Lérida You will not be able to continue to exploit because both the Socialist Party and Podemos have decided that you are the enemy Are you a trucker transporter Do you carry the goods that we all consume from one end of Spain to another You will not be able to start your truck you will not be able to win the bread because the Socialist Party and We have decided that your engine is the enemy of the world and that therefore who should make the effort to eliminate that CO2 is you it is not them They will continue in their seats sitting quietly they will have their official cars The test the synod of climate bishops met in Egypt a few weeks ago and there came all world leaders How 'd it go In their private aircraft of course none went on a rowboat all were contaminated They met at a luxury hotel What did they eat Meat of course they did not eat worms as they tell us that we should eat On the contrary they went there to pontify sitting on hypocrisy and decided that diesel vehicles for example would have to disappear that was said by the Socialist Minister of Ecological Transition from Spain in 2030 There will be no diesel cars as they have said So Spaniards when you vote against think about it
Ladies and gentlemen let them consult with us let them lower the bill and remove the ban on the exploitation of natural resources and of course nuclear resources but the basis is to ask the Spaniards Do they want the 2030 Agenda or do they want common sense Thank you very much
"Ladies and gentlemen it goes without saying that we are going to say no to this savagery that it does nothing but protect crime We are not going to support this infamous way of frivolating with something as sensitive and dramatic as people in vulnerable situations Okupas are not vulnerable consumers because the only thing consumed by the Okupas is the property of others the property of others the resources and mental health of good Spanish citizens who witness astonishment at how their rights are curtailed because this Government protects protects promotes and encourages illegal okupation Article 47 of the Constitution gives you the public authorities a mandate to ensure access to housing In times like those we are experiencing this happens because they solve the structural deficit of public housing and social rent and facilitate the supply of housing Okupation ladies and gentlemen is the way It is not the mechanism for access to decent and adequate housing This law is an armed robbery of the savers It is an indirect expropriation of the houses of the Spaniards And you know what Of the houses found in the most humble neighborhoods which are suffering 80 of this scourge in the face of the indolence of the public authorities This is not a vulnerable consumer defense this is an attack on our rule of law and you know quite well if not you yes the army of advisors who work for you that it is unconstitutional That is why VOX has already brought its 14th appeal before the Constitutional Court Not to mention the parties referring to ports hydraulics and discharges which have nothing to do with the title and which violate article 245 of our Criminal Code But of course they have to give content to a ministry of girl and turnip which should never have gone from general leadership and defend their positions within this infamous government and will resolve the Constitutional Court within a couple of years while they already have their budgets tied up which is really what interests them For something they voted against our initiative to limit the time limits of the Constitutional Court 's resolution It is the PSOE style to legislate unconstitutionally to please their bands and then when the Constitutional Court resolves skins to the sea However along the way there are victims who feel helpless and helpless when they claim their rights before a Government that is transferring a responsibility that is theirs from the Government to them They transfer the problem of housing to the owners thus transferring the situation of vulnerability to the owners as well Vulnerable consumers are the Spaniards who see 72 light up 23 gasoline 23 housing and who see the IPC shot and a shopping basket that is increasingly difficult for them to fill Vulnerable Consumer is Maria Luisa a 57 year old woman who has been in need of psychological help for two years the years her tenant does not pay her the rent of her house in Carabanchel Alto In five years he had no problems but the pandemic arrived and his tenant took over his social shield and stopped paying Maria Luisa is living well she 's sleeping on a friend 's couch A friend less bad than there are good people who in turn lives with her husband daughter in law two children and a grandson And meanwhile María Luisa continues to pay for the expenses of supplies of her inqui okupa the expenses of her housing and the judicial expenses Vulnerable consumer is Bethlehem of Benalmadena who after three years two weeks ago has recovered his home Yes the 86 metre house that his father left him where he grew up and spent his childhood He has recovered it destroyed without appliances completely vandalized and has had to pay 38,000 euros between supplies lawyers prosecutors and for that he has had to be indebted Now fixing the house would cost you another 30,000 euros and you do n't have them Who 's the vulnerable In VOX we have it clear we offer law and order and social housing Law and order as in the proposals of law that we have presented before this House to provide legal tools to our Security Forces and Bodies in order to immediately evict and raise the penalties of usurpation of property which are now punished only by a fine to four years in prison Of course that 's another one With the reform of the Criminal Code of the People 's Party in 2015 illegal misappropriation went from a serious crime to the new category of minor crime which is merely an administrative sanction It is just that you too ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party have given these criminals a very easy clue You have not come to improve the lives of anyone but yourself They use other people 's property and create legal insecurity when what they have to do is build social housing and facilitate the offer to improve access and scour prices Can you imagine if those who preceded us had not had legal certainty Do you think anyone would have built something And now they come with the threatening new housing law to give more legal insecurity and completely strangle the housing supply all the fruit of budgetary negotiations between you that have nothing to do with solving the problem They have already been warned by the General Council of the Judiciary of the legal uncertainty of the rule and of interference in private property and do not give them the approval but they do not care Mr Sicilia has already come out to say that he is sucking her that they are going to disregard the position of the General Council of the Judiciary and they are going to implement the same law Law and order ladies and gentlemen Law and order to protect our citizens Law and order to maintain the foundations of our rule of law freedom equality and property Law and order to be able to give protection to families in need Between those who do and those who do we are with those who do and you already know where you are Thank you"
Thank you very much Madam President Any proposal aimed at ending the optupation will always find the support of the VOX Parliamentary Group either in Congress or in any other institution in Spain But let 's start at the beginning Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party when they reformed the Criminal Code in 2015 to make the crime of illegal usurpation of real estate that is octopus a minor crime that is they put this crime at the same level as sipping a chocolate in Mercadona And of course with these limbs with this Penal Code that you ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party the judges have to issue their sentences And it 's not that judges are macho and patriarchal As strong as judges want to be as unfair as it may seem to them as it is that they deprive you of a good as precious as your home are the tools that are within their reach Okupa is fined and will be taken elsewhere Whether trespassing or unlawful usurpation possession must be returned immediately to its legitimate owner VOX will toughen the penalties and return to a rational penal system when we rule Okupación is one of the many debates that has brought VOX to this House Since governing the left it is true that illegal octopus has tripled but Rajoy 's last three years from 2015 to 2018 octopus had already increased by 18 and was a cry in the street This proposal for a law that you registered in August takes almost point by point what we already presented in June Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party when they copy us they 're right Copy it more and better They are however committed to leaving out the concern something which I hope they will be well advised to include within the time frame of amendments to this bill if the Communist seditious separatist and heirs of ETA approve their consideration Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party you come here very concerned about the safety of people and things in the communities of owners We are too terribly concerned but I ask why in the Community of Madrid despite the insistence of VOX do not do anything to solve it in the social housing of IVIMA Attention okupas regularized by the People 's Party in Madrid last year 115 okupas in 2020 regularized 91 okupas in 2019 regularized 183 okupas in 2018 253 okupas over 461 signed contracts more than half 55 of new contracts were for okupas criminals because in 2018 VOX was still not blowing their necks Do you know what this means for neighborly coexistence What 's the matter because they 're social housing they have to put up with this Because making social housing is not just promoting it cutting the tape taking the picture and delivering the housing then you have to manage it They regularize okupas with false reports with opinions from neighbors who are coerced The solution they are offering to these families who can no longer is to see if they change their promotion So you treat the tenants as if they were the problem and no the culprit is the okupa Last Friday here in Congress my parliamentary group organized a forum to deal with the problem of illegal okupation and anxiety I would like you to see and here are the videos how one of the tenants of the public housing that you manage broke by giving your testimony He was telling us what does it mean to live with okupas They probably know dirt crime danger fear threats fighting drugs These families are living in conditions that are less worthy of anything You regularize the Okupas of the IVIMA housing to clean up your Excel and the Okupas criminals become full contractors while there are thousands of families doing queues that are not accessing social housing and it is not fair Because no ladies and gentlemen that 's not the solution The solution is to want for these families what you are claiming here today in the Congress of Deputies Okupas must be excluded from any social assistance because the Okupas are not vulnerable the Okupas are criminals Another thing is the families that are really going through a situation of fragility These honorable families must be helped to pass the drink and be able to go ahead without chronizing their poverty without quantifying their dependence without promoting political clientelism This obligation to help because it is an obligation is the responsibility of the public authorities Demagogues and populists are constantly trying to confront in a manipulated manner articles 47 and 33 of our Constitution thus avoiding the responsibility of the public authorities and transferring this burden to private property In VOX we want to provide legal tools to the forces and security forces for immediate eviction to fight against the mafia and other intermediaries of the Okupas to prevent the pattern and the constitution of the house of the Okupas to legitimize the communities of owners to sue the Okupas and we also ask for the creation of a register of sentences for unpaid rents to fight against the inquio okupation And not only that the owner can claim the return of the IBI which also but urge the municipalities to then claim these amounts to the okupas We know that the Government is on the side of the criminals and all the enemies of Spain which well are the same You 're the worst nightmare the Spaniards have In VOX we assure you that we will rebuild everything you have destroyed Thank you very much
Thank you very much Madam President Last fall to approve the general budgets of the United States We demanded that his housing law that retaliatory of populist measures and sophistications that were needed to justify themselves before his parish be passed On the income limitation which is one of the star measures of this Bolivarian project a year ago the then responsible minister Mr Ábalos refused to limit the rent and Podemos reminded him that the pact obliges him In March the First Vice President and Minister for Economic Affairs said that simplifying complex problems does not help us solve them Already in July the budgets are getting closer former Minister Ábalos changes his mind and says that the rent increase in the tensioned areas must be limited to 10 The Minister of Quota the PSC quota it is understood comes to succeed him Raquel Sánchez who said that limiting the price of the rentals has not produced results But of course the pressures began and Podemos demands Raquel Sánchez to push the price control of the rents
Minister Sánchez already a portfolio in hand defends limiting rental prices And the PSOE who has been able to bargain even with the executioners of his own fellow rowers tied the budgets of the ruin and brought us this uninhabitable housing law Actually gentlemen of the PSOE it was not necessary because they had approved them equally Here are the NATO no bases out grabbing your chair They would n't have gone anywhere Where are they going In real estate as in any other sector price variations are a clear consequence of the basic law of supply and demand In particular in Spain wild price rises especially in rent have taken place in large cities and tourist centres And why Because the supply has been unable to absorb demand Public actions should encourage supply and not be totalitarian control measures They begin with reference to article 47 of the Spanish Constitution However the Government has not understood the right itself nor that the mandate to guarantee this right is addressed to the public authorities not to the citizens When establishing restrictions on private property the legislator must respect the fair balance between the means employed and the intended purpose Income control forced extensions IBI surcharges of up to 150 protection of the okupas and tenants With the measures contained in this bill you have surpassed the just balance A law aimed at guaranteeing access to housing which I repeat is an obligation of the public authorities cannot be fully supported by measures of interference in private property It is not that we do not like interventionist measures Mrs Garrido but that they do not work and produce the opposite effect By the way Mrs Garrido there is no title 47 of the Spanish Constitution The Spanish Constitution has ten titles On 27 January the General Council of the Judiciary issued a report on this bill which points to serious shortcomings both in form and substance a demolishing opinion that the Government of the Ruin has decided to ignore International evidence as in Berlin or Paris confirms that income limitation achieves exactly the opposite effect It achieves the creation of an illegal market the reduction in the investment of rental housing both for purchase and maintenance and rehabilitation the reduction of workers mobility and the segmentation of the population according to their purchasing power Because they do n't think this is going to affect people with the greatest purchasing power Those who will suffer as always are the humblest families and middle classes These practical cases are well known and hence the negative assessment of the General Council of the Judiciary since the Government has not carried out any assessment of the social benefits and disadvantages to justify the containment of income They have not included in the bill an evaluation studying the impact of this measure because its negative impact is widely known
Ladies and gentlemen raising the IBI to 150 to those owners who have vacant homes is absurd I remind you ladies and gentlemen that 70 of empty dwellings are in the depopulated areas in Spain which has been abandoned by the institutions The poor supply of rented housing is justified by the lack of adequate land liberalization the great public interventionism in the real estate market the legal insecurity and advancing on the left it is placed in the first position the legal protection and defencelessness of the owner before the okupas and the inqui okupas with the indolence of the public authorities The solutions to the housing problem are found in the Agenda Spain to free up all the land that is not or should be specially protected to build public social housing under ownership or lease with option to purchase to ensure that young people and families can acquire a home especially those with fewer resources to review and reduce massive taxes and burdens in the building process and to reform both the Criminal Code and the Criminal Prosecution and Civil Prosecution laws to protect real and effective owners Housing ladies and gentlemen is a social good and with basic notions of economy a lot of legal certainty and less populism we will be able to make policies that increase supply and we know how to do that Thank you very much
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Interior replied in writing that the illegal occupations have increased by 45 since 2018 however already Minister Campo accused our Senator Yolanda Melero of alarming and echoing the fake news the Minister of Justice Here in this very rostrum accused us of being afraid Vice President Díaz who is angry when anti-Okupation measures are presented says that the okupation does not exist and to finish Minister Montero the one that gives the most says that the okupation is an invention of VOX Home invasion or home usurpation is equally illegal and we want them out immediately But do we have laws in Spain to fight against ocupation Yes we do but they 're deficient What happens in Spain has no match in Europe In Germany France the United Kingdom and the Netherlands new legislation has been put in place to adapt to this reality And yes Mr Bal in those countries the eviction is immediate and resolved at police headquarters and then the trials are already taking place The good citizen is no longer believing in justice it is cheaper to pay the okupa than time stress worries lawyers and pay everything he has to pay to kick him out They are making it easy for the Okupas to coerce and extort and as we continue to allow neighboring patrols to partner to fight for the security of their neighborhoods this will end up like the wild west In this House it is where we have to give them a solution and it is not a question of being insensitive illegal occupation is not because there is a lack of social housing which of course is lacking at least two and a half million social housing units to place us only on the European average You promised 20,000 homes in 2018 and have not built one Social Services does not have the means to study the real situation they have to rely on the declaration of which it is said to be vulnerable and the Government which is incompetent to provide a housing solution denies the reality of the ocupation looks to the other side and bears that responsibility to the owners In raids or usurpations the normal thing as in all other crimes and regardless of the end result the normal thing would be the restitution of the immediate possession to its legitimate owner But why do n't the police act Because it does not have a clear legal framework or direct instructions for doing so So of course companies like Desocupa come up who do the mediation that the police should be able to do but they can't And those affected Mr. Mayoral are not Blackstone Cerberus or Morgan Stanley they are owners communities of neighbors and entire neighborhoods Illegal occupations have been occurring since 2012 and 2013 and have been growing and this is what we are talking about on the subway In VOX we have been presenting initiatives and proposals against ocupation since we entered this Congress In June this year we presented another proposal for a law combining initiatives that we had previously put forward to take action against octopus and harassment And you ladies and gentlemen of the PP presented your copy and paste of our proposal in August Well well ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party As we always tell them when they copy VOX they 're right You are asking in your motion to reinforce the penalties for the crime of usurpation but it is that it was you in your reform of the Criminal Code in 2015 who passed the usurpation to mild crime They ask to consider the registration of an okupa in the padrón null and ladies and gentlemen also in 2015 you issued a resolution by which the okupas could register anywhere regardless of whether they had an enabling title to reside there And now horses are laid when the Sánchez government in 2020 makes this same resolution or when the Sánchez government deals with separatists Have you forgotten the Covenant of the Majestic But I insist when PP copies VOX it 's right When we talked about energy sovereignty you accused us of wanting to go back to what autarchy and now you 're talking about energy sovereignty We do n't finally see their deputies with that pin of fucking agenda colors that they imposed on us in 2015 and that 's ruining our fields and our economy Now I ask you since you copy us you copy us completely and do not leave out the reality of worry These are the tenants who become okupas with premeditation and fading false vulnerable mostly who are ruining thousands and thousands of families Please keep in mind Thank you very much"
"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen good morning We are faced with a bill that of hybrid asymmetries which returns again to Congress as other parliamentary groups have said after passing through the Senate for approval today The draft law transposes a Community directive the main basis of which is to avoid tax avoidance in such a way as to prevent transactions between an entity of a Member State in this case Spain and another of a Member State or third countries from occurring where the same expenditure is deductible twice which is deducted from expenditure without weighing the equivalent income the double non-inclusion of an income or the double use of tax credits We call these situations hybrid asymmetries and they are presumed to be hybrid legal qualifications that cause tax asymmetries that can be used as instruments of aggressive tax planning to achieve the objective of tax avoidance However the bill of Royal Decree 4/2021 leaves much to be desired and demonstrates once again the abuse and totalitarianism of a Government that interferes with the legislative power making it a despotic and absolutist regime And it is ladies and gentlemen because this government has kidnapped the legislature and I explain myself Because during its proceedings in Congress the spokesman for the Socialist Group stated that it should not have been dealt with as a bill and yet an amendment of the Socialist Group was incorporated into its proceedings making the remaining amendments that improve the legislative text and then in the Senate used this bill to incorporate seven more amendments The rejected amendments emphasized the elimination of the cascade effect of tax groups and the temporary abolition of the digital services tax better known as the Google rate which we believe should be done within the OECD environment In fact the introduction of this tax has been a failure having raised up to November 165 million of the planned 968 million And secondly because of what has been experienced in the Senate admitting several amendments from this parliamentary group and producing a legislative latrociny whose excuse has been that the Google rate suppression amendment submitted does not have the proper relationship of congruence with the bill However seven amendments of the Socialist Group have been incorporated into the draft law including six relating to the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union on model 720 And I ask you ladies and gentlemen If the amendment concerning the Google rate does not maintain the proper relationship of congruence with the bill do the amendments concerning the amendment of model 720 do so Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party and other co-religionaries who support the Government you are usurping the General Courts legislative capacity damaging both institutions and generating in citizens tiredness and mistrust However with regard to the incorporation of the amendments of the PSOE into the draft law on the sanction imposed on Spain by model 720 it is necessary to explain what it is because I am sure that many in their homes will be asking and I am convinced that many of your ladies and gentlemen do not know it Model 720 is an information statement which is presented each year in March which relates to goods and rights located abroad and is presented in excess of EUR 50 000 And this started in 2013 when Cristóbal Montoro was Minister of Finance a model that did not take into account the prescription and sanctions 150 of the undeclared amount curiously two of the criteria for which Spain was sanctioned by the Court of Justice of the European Union A striking example of Hacienda 's abuse of this model is the famous case of the retired taxi driver from Granada who declared out of time that he had 340,000 euros of a participation of a sicav in Switzerland and for which he had to enter Hacienda 188 000 euros that is 55 of what he had and a sanction of 150 that is 254,000 euros was claimed In total 442,000 euros were claimed 102,000 euros more than he had And you ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party and ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party stood idly by while this taxpayer was being sanctioned in addition to collecting and confiscating much more than he had and did nothing to change it Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party you have been ruling since 2018 and could have processed or changed the legislative text so that these sanctions would not apply or that the prescription would be taken into account In fact in 2015 you suggested to the government that model 720 should be presented as an out of date declaration avoiding the application of the 150 penalty Why did n't they change it when they came to the government Out of ineptitude You 've been portrayed But this disintegration is even worse because during the processing of the draft Law on the Prevention and Combating of Tax Fraud in May 2021 this parliamentary group and the deputy speaking to them in the debate in the Commission of the said Law within the amendments defended number 75 which proposed the repeal of several articles of the Law on Corporate Tax and Law 7/2012 which have to do with the imprescriptibility of model 720 and the disproportionate application of sanctions so Spain has been sanctioned It turns out that now the government nine months later and after the sentence on Spain 's costs incorporates the same amendment that VOX presented in May in an act of cynicism proper to an incompetent and ineffective government Once again VOX was right and proposed in May last year the possibility of repealing part of the legislative text on model 720 And as always the absence of common sense in your ladies and gentlemen demonstrates your political blindness Dependence on a charge irreparably damages the optic nerve that allows them to discern reality Thank you so much"
"With the coming Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon A preliminary question Socialists you are remembering the 22nd anniversary of the death of your colleague Ernest Lluch killed by two shots into the head by terrorist Lierni Armendáriz but what you are not saying is that his killer is now in semi- freedom thanks to the third degree granted by the Basque Government after assuming prison competition since October last year Socialists you have no shame and this is a clear example of how you prisoners change for budgets Minister now yes you say that we arrived with strong growth Does that mean we 've recovered 2019 levels Minister do n't lie They present us with budgets of ruin and with a clear propagandistic objective It is noted that next year both municipal and general elections are held You have put the rest into these budgets to promote the Czar of the Moncloa and start up all the machinery Firstly for the Presidency of the European Union in the second half of the year with more than EUR 150 million and secondly full of slogans such as social justice inclusive growth fiscal responsibility regardless of whether or not they fit into reality directing its strategy to more than 14 million Spaniards including pensioners up by 8.5 public employees up by 3.5 and young people with the help of the cultural bonus of EUR 400 which for all that has served ladies and gentlemen is to fill the Wallapop page and exchange the voucher received by the cash and all with the firm intention of remaining in power at any cost But you Mrs. Calviño do n't stay there Now by including an additional provision to the Democratic Memory Act they intend to give away and promise Spanish nationality as if it were a candy with the sole and exclusive aim of obtaining votes Moreover his colleague Minister Albares who sits three more seats to his left is campaigning together with the hordes pumitas in different Hispanic American countries to capture exiles and give them their nationality with the aim of the generals of 2023 You Minister the extreme left of this country because you are in league with the Communists of Podemos with the secessionists and separatists of ERC and with the heirs of ETA once you are in power will do everything possible not to release it even though it is through supposed democratic tools loaded with the most radical totalitarianism buying wills and every identity feature of the person until it turns the nation into a true cave of pirates And who will pay for their ideological delusions and the consequences of ruinous budgets The usual Minister the families the middle classes the SMEs the shops the self employed It is his ministry 's responsibility to pursue economic policy in support of enterprise and reforms to improve potential growth You have indeed stated that SMEs and self employed people play a fundamental role in your ministry and that they are the heart of our economy an expression by the way that you like to say to yourself in many of your interventions Well Minister your policies are bleeding the SMEs and the self employed Currently 40 of small and medium sized businesses have closed with losses in the first half of 2022 In the third quarter more than 20 000 businesses disappeared and 90 000 remain in a state of technical bankruptcy Nearly 350,000 businesses are in crisis and run the risk of disappearing The ICO loans which were announced as extraordinary aid for SMEs and self employed will end up giving the dots to self employed people Alongside this many sectors have now seen their costs increase by up to 50 due to the rise in light gasoline labour costs raw materials and gas This spiral of increase seems to have no end and is suffocating the SMEs and the autonomous You Minister offer only a few crumbs since within the measures taken you will increase the deduction for expenditure of difficult justification from 5 to 7 and reduce the SMEs from 25 to 23 i.e. only 2 points while our SMEs and self employed people suffer an increase of up to 50 SMEs businesses and self employed people are in a limited situation and can no longer endure Look I 'm going to give you a real example The other day I met an autonomous woman from the transport specifically from the taxi who told me that her situation was unsustainable He was fifty five years old separated with two kids in college with a mortgage and a taxi license Well since before the pandemic to this day the mortgage for the rise of the Euribor has amounted to 200 euros the cost of gasoline diesel in this case 400 euros more in the light of his house has gone from paying 80 euros to more than 200 euros because in addition above his house had electric heaters the shopping basket between 15 and 20 and was frightened by the new rise of autonomous next year That is almost 1000 euros per month 1000 euros over monthly cost and working sixteen hours per day But the bloodiest thing is that when he retires because he quotes for the minimum because they do n't give him the numbers he will charge 960 euros per month working sixteen hours Sixteen hours a day for 960 euros And if we add to this that for the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2023 a decrease in consumption of up to 60 is expected for businesses businesses and self employed people this will cause many to have to close the blind and put themselves on the line of unemployment or if necessary sell everything they have if they have anything left Madam Minister the heart of our economy bleeds it retorts in pain for its economic policies and you are the most responsible At the beginning of this legislature you seemed to be the discordant voice of this government but you only seemed Today with its policies and attitude it is another piece of this Government that changes budgets for votes prisoners for budgets gives nationalities for votes and benefits seditious and rapists A long time ago I asked him what was the boundary between ambition and consciousness Today I have no doubt that you have no conscience and that you are prisoners of your excessive ambition and your own interests so as to remain in power and that in order to throw you because you will not leave from VOX as the only possible alternative we will show the Spaniards the misery and the moral and economic ruin that you represent Nothing more Thank you so much"
"Come on President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon The motion that we are debating today as a result of urgent questioning must cause us to reflect on the figure of the self employed Because ladies and gentlemen what is it to be an autonomous A self employed person today is a hero a tireless worker without hours without holidays who rarely falls ill who plays it every day who responds with his personal heritage And now the ruin government intends to give the final stock through a reform of the autonomous contribution system Two weeks ago Minister Escrivá prides himself on the aid that this Government had provided during the current crisis caused by the pandemic aid of course is insufficient Many of them took months to receive administrative chaos and today 110,000 self employed people are still in a state of cessation VOX warned at the beginning of the pandemic Spain must be protected but it can not be stopped Pilar Antonio Luis are some of the autonomous with whom we have spoken during this campaign in Castile and León and who survive the mismanagement of a government that has crucified and sacrificed thousands of autonomous during this crisis We all agreed on one thing we do n't want any help we just want them to let us work they do n't put any more restrictions on us they do n't put any more taxes on us You ladies and gentlemen all the members and groups of the parliamentary arch except VOX refused to be able to work for thousands of autonomous people They did so consciously not only by their vote in favour of the states of alarm declared illegal by the Constitutional Court but also in their respective kingdoms of taifas closing business and prohibiting working in sectors such as hospitality catering night entertainment or gymnastics An example of this is the measures that the People 's Party of Castile and León implemented during the second state of illegal alarm being the hardest and most restrictive prohibiting thousands of self employed people from working That is why this past day 13 more than 212,000 Castilians and Leonians have placed their trust in VOX becoming the third political force of the community and in the hope of thousands of autonomous people I have been self employed almost all my professional life and I know perfectly well what it is to pay the self employed quota every month regardless of the income you have And the government with this reform intends to change the system of contributions of self employed people by making them pay on the basis of net returns But ladies and gentlemen what is net performance and who will provide it If the net return is the result of which is the minus income minus expenditure what expenses will be deductible Is it necessary to apply the rules of the IRPF and the rules of corporation tax as regards the calculation of net return Because the contribution for real income is not the net return because that means leaving the contribution according to the deduction capacity of the self employed Today a lot of self employed people have no activity related expenses If finally the net return is that declared in the self employed 's IRPF what would happen to a possible review by the self employed 's expenditure management Does Social Security penalize the self employed in the event that the net return calculated by the Administration is higher If you appeal to the self employed and then the courts give you the reason would Social Security return the wrong charges and sanctions This is going to turn into real chaos These questions must be resolved in order to guarantee the self employed the necessary legal certainty Ladies and gentlemen of the Government they want the contribution of 1.8 million self employed people to rise by 40 over the next two years and yet the decrease to 1.4 million self employed people is only 10 And they do so by proclaiming themselves the most progressive government of democracy Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party you have no shame For the rest we must now add the rise in energy prices the quotas to be returned by a million self employed people from April to May of ICO credits and the rise in labour costs In other words being an autonomous in Spain will become a real feat These measures are not the result of chance they have a clear desire to collect and a final objective the destruction of the Spanish business fabric and the disappearance of the autonomous directly violating article 38 of the Spanish Constitution on freedom of enterprise Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party and the rest of the acolytes it will be impossible to start a business in Spain as long as you continue to rule Thank you so much"
With all due respect Madam President Ladies and gentlemen good morning Do you know what are the main objectives of the Next Generation funds associated with the Recovery and Resilience Mechanism According to the European Commission there are three helping Member States to recover relaunching the economy and supporting private investment Currently none but none of the three objectives are being met First of all because the recovery of our country so often mentioned by the Executive is a dream more of one Government that lies and that recounts an illusionist speech full of sweet smell of naphthaline perhaps prelude to parliamentary dysfunction The funds should be used to carry out investments in the public and private sectors to improve the productivity of the economy but they are not becoming a lever for economic growth and their impact has been virtually nil in 2021 and scarce in 2022 according to the AIReF and the Banco de España During the year 2021 there was a drop in Spanish productivity never before seen in economic history 6.6 lower than at the beginning of the crisis
"Thank you very much Ladies and gentlemen Spain has the lowest productivity of the great powers of the euro it is 7 points below the European Union average and not the base of 100 European benchmarks since at least 2005 Secondly as far as the funds should have revived the Spanish economy the situation is as follows and ladies and gentlemen these are data Spain 's GDP in the second quarter of 2022 is 2.6 lower than the figures for the fourth quarter of 2019 The trade deficit has increased to 31 963 million in the first quarter Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the European Union and the total number of unemployed is more than 3.3 million unemployed including the unemployed and those of limited availability and as you know August has closed with 190,000 fewer jobs adding up to 40,000 more unemployed The indebtedness of public administrations has reached a historical peak and already exceeds 1.47 billion euros Inflation in July as has already been said here this morning was confirmed at 10.8 and in August it is 10.5 while the euro area average remains below 9 Thirdly on the objective of supporting private investment the Executive once again demonstrates its incompetence in boosting the economy In the first half of the year they have only made payments from the funds amounting to EUR 2620 million i.e. 9,2 of the budgeted for the whole year according to data published by the General Intervention of the State Administration Of this volume of payments 65 i.e. EUR 17 billion have been paid to the Autonomous Communities to publish their calls and tenders the pace of which is unknown since they are not made public This means that in practice the money that has come to private companies and public bodies is only EUR 920 million The reality ladies and gentlemen is that the money from the funds is not reaching the self employed SMEs or small businesses What are the reasons Excessive red tape only 14 of SMEs plan to participate in the award processes deadlines that cannot be met sometimes there are only ten days for the registration of applications lack of transparency and opacity in the destination of the funds little and late execution of the funds when the main focus of the funds their destination is the public sector and a scant impact on the economy as I have said before as the AIReF has commented That is why since VOX and considering the motion tabled today by the People 's Party we have tabled an amendment with two paragraphs that improve the operative part although the People 's Party has expressed its rejection The first and fundamental is to promote measures to increase the participation of SMEs entrepreneurs and self employed people and that money that money reaches the self employed SMEs and entrepreneurs which is not happening Secondly and this is perhaps why those of the People 's Party have rejected it it is to condition the receipt of funds that the autonomous communities comply with the measures proposed by the motion Ladies and gentlemen of the Government and other palm trees who really support it do the Spanish a favour resign for incompetents because the greater their incompetence the greater the misery for the Spanish Really resign call elections and allow the Spaniards to decide their future and own their destiny Thank you so much"
With all due respect Madam President Ladies and gentlemen good morning Minister dear Carmen and other guests today we are debating the adoption of the emerging business bill better known as startups During its parliamentary procedure quite a number of amendments have been incorporated although none by the way of this parliamentary group but some of the other groups that shared the same purpose as those tabled by VOX The first amendment tabled by this parliamentary group concerned the elimination within the explanatory statement of the law of the inclusion once again of the so called gender gap which is nothing more than an ideological term which the left uses as a mantra in a supposed defence of women to whom however ladies and gentlemen they do not defend indeed a term used by Mr Píriz in his speech in the Commission stating that one in five entrepreneurs are women Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party you will never change Then it bothers them when we tell them that they are part of the consensus progress but it is that they always buy the speech on the left because I ask them whether there is any impediment to women being entrepreneurial because of their sex as Mr Píriz said in the Commission or if on the contrary what exists is lack of support for women who are mothers and who have more difficulties in reconciling their family life Ladies and gentlemen what exists in Spain today is the maternal gap There is no wage difference because of being a woman what exists is discrimination because of having children What should be done is to reward the hiring of parents in businesses and the protection of the family If you do not believe me I refer you to the report by the Banco de España whose conclusions are devastating I warned that the maternity pay gap was 28 Under no circumstances is the word gender mentioned a term by the way used sibilically by the left to criminalize man And to subscribe the statements of Olivia 's father my dear friend Eugenio to whom I was able to accompany this Tuesday in Segovia to fire his murdered daughter allegedly at the hands of her mother manifesting listen well your lordships that this is not of men and women but of good and bad The feminist perspective must disappear from any legal text and from our lives forever Only by the inclusion of ideological terms would this bill deserve our disapproval But it is no less true that the sector is quite satisfied with the bill and we must acknowledge that the text of the law has been improved albeit not sufficiently This is mainly due to the method used by the Government vetoing 57 of the 271 amendments tabled using a totalitarian approach and without any legal basis Firstly because amendments affecting the decrease in income and a generic concept are being vetoed without determining exactly what heading such an amendment would be concerned with And in addition it is being done on the future benefit when it should be the current benefit because the decrease in budgetary revenue is not a fact that is likely to be certain but a fact of probability Secondly because there is a distortion of the very raison d'être of the power of the veto of the Government recognized in article 134.6 of the Spanish Constitution since the aforementioned power of the Government is exercised as it is exercised in the proceedings has to be examined by the Chamber And there is lewdness on the part of the groups in accepting the vetoes undermining the legislative powers of the Congress so that this recently executed practice by the Government is preventing the parliamentary groups from carrying out their functions as has happened in the paper and in the Commission And thirdly because there is no precedent in the history of this House for vetoing amendments that affect the decline in income when it is also an estimate As the Government has raised an additional 28 billion up to September by breaking its forecasts there is no point in vetoing amendments that affect a tax such as for example the IRPF because because of the elasticity of this tax the application of a deduction in the IRPF may result in higher collection and higher revenues This practice must be denounced as another element of this Government which manages the institutions at its own discretion Ladies and gentlemen tell me what is the point then of parliamentary groups submitting amendments Is n't it logical with a startup law to introduce amendments that affect tax laws And if they do is n't it logical that they can lower income Also on the contrary it may happen that a deduction for example in IRPF increases them Do you ladies and gentlemen agree to apply a practice that can be used by future governments I have already told you that this parliamentary group will initiate the necessary legal measures to determine whether or not the veto on the amendments is in line with the law Ladies and gentlemen it turns out that some of the vetoed amendments proposed an ostensible improvement of the law including increasing from five to seven or from seven to twelve if they are biotechnological the years to be considered startups increasing the base of deduction in IRPF for investment in startups from EUR 100 000 to EUR 1 million increasing the limit of own funds to be considered startups from EUR 400 000 to EUR 1 million increasing for example the three to five year period for the application of the 15 tax rate on company tax on startups or reducing the tax on certain digital services from 3 to 1.5 to taxpayers in Ceuta and Melilla In total the budgetary impact of the above mentioned amendments which the Government vetoed amounts to EUR 128 million i.e. almost EUR 130 million the same amount that Mr Sánchez has promised to give to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation behind the back of the Spanish and less than the more than EUR 150 million that has been reserved for the Presidency of Europe Ladies and gentlemen it is an unprecedented act of hypocrisy and phariseeism by a government that vetoes illegal amendments amendments that could have improved this law for entrepreneurs SMEs self employed people and investors For Sánchez 's wishes there is no money to help them but there is money for his whims and delusions of power when it comes to promoting himself and who knows if perhaps also preparing for his departure Ladies and gentlemen when we govern we will repeal all ideological laws on the first day and return to the Spaniards the place they deserve and should never lose Thank you so much
Thank you Mr. President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Almost four million Spaniards have put us in this House to stop absolutely all the trophies carried out by the government that we are suffering in all areas both in the area that is going to occupy us in the debate now and in the area of the attack on the institutions that are so serious that we are living in the last few days And I assure you that we will not stop until we give back the voice to the Spaniards who belong to them The subject of the debate that we are now beginning is the proposed law presented by the VOX Parliamentary Group for the amendment of Law 7/1985 of 2 April Regulator of the Local Regime This initiative is crucial to addressing one of the most important problems that our country is facing in recent years which is well known to you and which is often denied to you which is the problem of mass immigration One of the circumstances that allows one of the open doors in this system of open borders is also the open door that exists in the civil neighbourhood system of some municipalities and it is that in cases of occupation and illegal immigration there are some municipalities in which to register is too simple and in the end this constitutes a fraud to our public system and a fraud in short to our social service system Ladies and gentlemen in this debate I would like us to address an issue that is often in your mouths and which however seems that most of you lack the basic meaning or the basic elements of the most elementary notion of what constitutes social justice Ladies and gentlemen social justice is not about ending hunger in the world because it is impossible Social justice is not to end hunger in the world with general budgets of the State the general budgets of the State of Spain because it is impossible and to say the opposite it is nothing other than lying to the Spaniards it is an act of hypocrisy Ladies and gentlemen social justice is not bringing seven million Africans without resources to our country because it is said by a ministry because they say a number of economic powers that in the face of Europe 's demographic decline we need slave and mass labour to cover precarious jobs Ladies and gentlemen social justice would not be this because it is common sense common sense which although common is unfortunately the least common sense in this House It is common sense that if we bring seven million Africans without resources to our country in the coming years we would not be reducing poverty but we would increase it exactly by seven million people But it is also a very elementary notion of social justice that purporting to bring seven million people without resources to our country is also an act of hypocrisy when in Spain and in the light of the latest data there are 13 million people at risk of social exclusion and poverty It is a very serious act of hypocrisy and it is absolutely contrary to social justice Ladies and gentlemen social justice would help these 13 million people at risk of poverty Social justice would end the two and a half million people in severe poverty Social justice would be to build the three and a half million official protection homes that are still needed in Spain only to be on the average in the European countries around us Social justice would be a real end to energy poverty The other day I had the opportunity to visit as we all often do in our political activity a residential center with people with disabilities and highly dependent in this intellectual case We see large figures in the general budgets of the State but when we go to small associations when we go to small residences we see as in this particular centre how social justice really is far from being achieved It is a center that had difficulty paying the bills of light recent bills of light that amounted to 8500 euros It is a center that does social work in each of the municipalities of Spain and if politicians are not to fix the lives of people who really need it politicians do not serve at all Ladies and gentlemen do you not realize that not only these thirteen million people at risk of poverty or the two million people at risk of severe poverty or the small centres as I have just told you which exist in virtually all the municipalities of Spain if they do not have their basic needs covered we cannot afford to accommodate seven million people without resources from other countries Do n't you realize the enormous and gigantic hypocrisy that this is A consultant GIS has recently carried out a study indicating that foreigners which is well known to you account for about 11.4 of the population and consume around 50 of public aid for poverty That is that half of the public aid in Spain we are not using for social justice we are using it to open borders and harm the most vulnerable Spaniards Ladies and gentlemen the standard unfortunately is the tool used for access to public aid in a fraudulent way and is also a tool that suits you because at the end of the day it has a so called effect and you can continue to talk about water to the international economic powers Ladies and gentlemen you live very well in your manuals of political theory you live very well in your idealism we tell you every day but every day we check it with greater vehemence live away from what the Spaniards feel and suffer in their neighborhoods In your manuals you come to say that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people can come to integrate and work in a possible and magical multiculturalism in which cultural origin is equal and this is also a lie If they paid less attention to their political theory manuals and more attention to what humble Spaniards suffered in their homes they would realize We have explained it a thousand times and we will do it again without getting tired because for that they have put so many Spaniards here who suffer it day by day immigration and crime are related this is common sense and is elementary criminology Ladies and gentlemen there is a crime factor that is indeed cultural There is an imported crime There are forms of crime that are possible in many countries in our environment and that are not characteristic of our culture But there is also an increase in common crime which is also an elementary notion of criminology because it is normal for common crime to increase when we bring massively people from places where there are forms of common crime such as rapes which occur 80 times more than in our indigenous societies It 's elementary criminology and it's common sense and we 'll say it every time we can However today I would like to dwell on one of the great losers in the mass immigration debate women There is a great difference between European civilization and other opposing cultures and it is that for Christian civilization women have always been the soul of Europe However for other cultures women are the slave of man and you are massively importing people from these cultures If you import massively people from Nigeria Malawi Swaziland Zimbabwe Cameroon from all these countries you will see on our streets customs of these countries In Spain we can already see female genital mutilation According to a study by the Autonomous University of Barcelona according to data from the National Institute of Statistics in Spain there are 3652 girls at risk of female genital mutilation thanks to their open border policies In Spain we are also seeing girls at risk of forced marriages There are other cultures that also have institutional figures such as polygamy which are also tremendously unfair to women There are also crimes of honour we have all seen videos of absolutely brutal stoning in Nigeria and this is a culture that we must not respect that we must fight because it is in our origins and it is in our nature to fight a barbarity such as a stoning or a forced marriage There you also say many times that you are how was it the granddaughters of the witches that we could n't burn or something like that say right Well there are countries where women are really being burned for witchcraft You 're massively importing people from those countries here In their manuals of political theory they also say that ocupation is a problem of the powerful of the banks and of the investment funds and however a large volume of occupation is due to another very different reality Okupación is in the hands of mafias who take advantage of human suffering who take advantage of poverty and who trade with people who do not have a roof who do not have a shelter You ladies and gentlemen dance the water to those mafias who turn buildings into drug and prostitution supermarkets which destroy neighborhoods where before better or worse at least one could live Ladies and gentlemen living in a safe neighborhood should n't be a privilege for the rich You have made it into that you have made it a luxury within the reach of very few and if you ever close your policy manuals
"Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen do you remember Martyrdom With a pension of 500 euros a month two daughters five grandchildren seven mouths to feed and having to pay the rent Do you remember Miguel who had a dependent highly dependent woman I had to be 20 hours a day connected to a machine and I was afraid they 'd cut off the light Do you remember when the public wrote articles about Martyrdom and Miguel and when you from Podemos denounced from your accounts the energy poverty suffered by Martyrdom and suffered by Miguel Do you remember that they were asking to rehabilitate 500,000 homes a year Do you remember that energy poverty caused 7,000 deaths in Spain Do you remember how the public denounced situations of energy poverty And yet we now watch the public newspaper headline that Sánchez is going to Germany to lower energy prices to fulfill his promises with the Spanish Do you agree with the public that PP and VOX do not vote in favour of measures to lower energy prices Do you remember when the Sixth was also concerned about energy poverty in Évole 's programmes Do you remember when The Sixth was talking about family income and the price of energy Do you remember when the Sixth said we paid a lot of taxes Do you remember Do you remember when the PSOE called demonstrations for energy poverty in 2016 Or when you congratulated Christmas by also calling people to the streets on December 21 to denounce energy poverty to denounce as Mrs Montero said that seven million people had difficulty paying the bill for the light and that five million people could not pay for the heating Do you remember when Mr. Iglesias from this rostrum was questioning the minister telling him that he also wanted minutes of silence for all those who died of energy poverty in Spain Do you remember Because this happened with light at 60 euros megawatt hour and today the price of light has reached 700 euros megawatt hour Ladies and gentlemen today energy poverty affects almost 11 of the population Today the shopping basket is more expensive Today the purchasing power of the Spaniards has diminished Today poverty has increased at historical levels Today people are much poorer than when you went out on the street to tell us Ladies and gentlemen if at 60 euros the megawatt hour died 7000 people in winter due to energy poverty how many people die at 700 euros the megawatt hour Why are you two shut up Why did they stop reporting him Because you apart from hypocrites are the most antisocial government in Spanish history Because you 're the government of the most expensive light bill in history And what happened For the Spanish to understand many things have happened It has happened first of all that no one cares about Spain that bipartisanship one day decided to sell energy sovereignty that bipartisanship decided to take advantage of the companies and take shillings on the boards of directors with rotating doors shillings of which you ladies and gentlemen of Podemos have also taken advantage Little shillings that have been taken advantage of by their UGT colleagues Ladies and gentlemen the rotating mafia which you no longer criticise energy poverty which you no longer care about are real problems for the Spaniards the sale of our country 's energy sovereignty aggravated moreover by climate frivolity by all those policies that you defend from the supranational institutions from the Paris Accords the Green Pact the 2030 Agenda and its climate change law which has condemned the Spaniards to that 700 euros per hour Ladies and gentlemen the energy sector is not only deeply dependent but you have left it at the dawn of those supranational powers of those dictates that they do to you from the Davos Forum and I do not say so as the Spanish Official College of Geologists also says that Spain has not been able to harness its energy potential its raw materials and minerals to reduce its energy dependence Ladies and gentlemen it is urgent for Spain to draw up an energy sovereignty plan with real experts not with militants put to scientists as you have used throughout the pandemic Energy sovereignty is essential for national security Energy is a strategic issue for nations which you do not like and condemn Energy sovereignty is essential for a nation to be free and independent it is essential to have the capacity to protect the Spaniards it is essential for the development of the economies and for the international strength of Spain Ladies and gentlemen you called us autarchics you called us anti-Europeans you call us negatists and the only anti-Europeans here are you who have sold Europe 's energy capacity to third parties We must end your climate frivolity ladies and gentlemen because being environmentalists today is a matter of status you have nothing to do with protecting nature you impart your dogmas and fashions from Malasaña and impose them on the Spaniards and our energy sector Ladies and gentlemen you all live in a permanent fiction and it is that foreign agendas and governments will improve people 's lives No the only thing that will improve Martyr 's life and Miguel 's life is that Spain fights for energy sovereignty and the ability to protect its own Thank you so much"
Thank you very much Madam President Minister another year coming from the general budgets of the State I believe that you already know what I have come to say just as I already knew what you have come to present because unfortunately how you endorse your political decisions as my party 's spokesman the most important law of the year the general budgets of the state which is the law that is precisely what the policies that this government is going to implement are going to be that has not changed in its ministry on the contrary we have deepened in the same mistakes You are also a very moderate minister you could perfectly be the minister of bipartisanism PP and PSOE because you were also a very well known personality in the People 's Party as President Rajoy himself appointed you president of the AIReF You who are such a moderate minister you who are so moderate among you and with the powerful but so hard with the Spanish with these budgets Ladies and gentlemen the accounts that come to be presented are the usual ones because they win the usual ones and because they lose the usual ones the ones below the most modest Spaniards the most humble Spaniards We 've explained it to the full we 've explained it a thousand times but it 's okay we 're going to explain it again Its accounts support a political decision which is the political decision of the open borders of mass immigration of uncontrolled immigration You give them millions and millions in programs to help immigrants You are increasing the appropriations for asylum and reception policies by 134 You give millions for asylum and reception policies in the Canary Islands You give millions to Morocco In short you invest millions and millions and millions in the usual policies of mass and uncontrolled immigration that harm the most modest Spaniards It draws attention to the fact that there are things that are growing very much we have said 134 almost 40 support for immigrants and there are things that are growing very little even things that are falling You allow yourself the luxury of increasing aid to immigrants by almost 40 and however of reducing non-contributory pensions and benefits to the Spaniards by 11 Minister I do n't know where you live I do n't care either but I 'm sure you live in a mansion in an urbanization wherever where you probably have security right Well where the most modest Spaniards where the most humble Spaniards live do not enjoy that security that you enjoy and do not do so because of their policies And again we will explain again what the most modest Spaniards are suffering in their meats and that you are striving to deny permanently Why do the Spaniards who live in the most modest places in Spain lose Firstly because a policy in favour of open borders a policy with massive and uncontrolled immigration generates a cultural invasion That is for a numerical question in places where a particular culture is majority over others as you well know because I am convinced that you know it such pink multiculturalism does not work cultures impose on each other and create problems It creates problems in this pink multiculturalism because in the end there are ethnic clashes cultural confrontations and cultural imposition On the other hand they lose the most humble Spaniards because massive and uncontrolled immigration in these places also generates crime and insecurity The taboo theme immigration and crime it is impossible to relate it without you calling us racists xenophobics of everything Well it 's a critical basic criminological issue On the one hand it increases imported crime It 's common sense In Spain and Europe we are seeing forms of imported crime that did not exist forms such as female genital mutilation such as forced marriages forms such as sexual assaults called taharrush gamemea which I am sure you also know very well what they consist of in the harassment and collective sexual assault of men in mass to women who find themselves alone often taking advantage of even the multitudes practices that originate moreover in countries such as Egypt But in addition insecurity and common crime increase theft increase homicide increase and rape increase It is also common sense that on the one hand common crime occurs in the economically most depressed places of course but there is also a cultural factor for the increase of common crime in these places which increases rape when it comes massively to places where there are eighty times more rapes than in Spain places where homicides are much more frequent places where there is no justice and justice is applied by hand This is essential criminology and it is common sense and telling the Spaniards is telling them the truth Do not be afraid to recognize the truth Ladies and gentlemen a third factor that you provoke in humble Spaniards is precariousness because massive and uncontrolled immigration pulls wages and increases poverty as the figures are unfortunately showing When you choose these policies you choose cultural invasion you choose insecurity and you choose precariousness for the Spaniards Is this to say that all foreigners are criminals No no it 's not there are many foreigners with very good will This is simply to say that massive and uncontrolled immigration and its many cultural factors increases insecurity and increases crime The Ministry of the Interior says so I do n't say so The Ministry of the Interior says for example that 34 per cent of the violations committed in Spain are committed by 11 per cent of the population the latest report by the Ministry of the Interior Your Honor I am convinced that you are so moderate with the powerful so moderate with the mafias so moderate with the Davos Forum so moderate with the World Bank so moderate with the complicit NGOs so moderate with those who live like you but that it is very hard with the Spanish And people who are having a bad time
I 'm done Madam President People who are having a bad time the 13 million Spaniards who are at risk of poverty those who can't pay the shopping cart those who can't pay the gas those who can't pay the rent do n't want moderation want firmness Thank you so much
Thank you Mr. President We came here to discuss a motion resulting from an urgent inquiry by the People 's Group an inquiry last week to the Minister of the Interior recommending his action in the massive assaults of the previous week on the Melilla fence I must say that this motion that you have tabled has proved to be deeply disconcerting to us Firstly you say that the PP rejects the so called effect that it rejects the open doors that it rejects the massive regulations and that it rejects the ships of the NGOs You Rajoy 's party are the registrar of the property that he said he did n't believe in the borders the party that regularizes immigrants with food bills the party of massive regularizations before Zapatero 480 185 illegal immigrants and already with Rajoy 360 000 illegal immigrants the party of Feijóo which has said that it wants to speed up access to nationality the party also of Feijóo which offers in its day Galicia for the reception of immigrants arriving from the ship Aquarius and which offers collaboration with Doctors without Borders or SOS Mediterranean NGOs that as you all know collaborate with the mafias of human trafficking You also say that the People 's Party rejects the dispersion of irregular immigrants throughout the national geography and you reject it so much that Feijóo was also talking about welcoming all the menas who had arrived in Ceuta so much so that Juanma Moreno spends two million euros on welcoming immigrants and asks to disperse all those who arrive in the Canary Islands throughout the national geography so much so that the Junta de Castilla y León will open a menas centre in Salamanca right next to an elderly residence But you also say that in order to protect our borders we have to deploy Frontex and this is what someone says that I do n't know if he does n't know what he 's saying or wants to fool us because Frontex is useless Frontex has n't expelled a single immigrant since he 's been on the move Frontex serves to continue sending files to Warsaw if that 's what you want to do but of course that 's not protecting our borders Stop thinking that everything is going to work out for us in Brussels because the reality is that we are alone and that we have to deploy our own resources You also say that you have to do training exercises for our Armed Forces to collaborate with our state security forces and bodies What this Minister of the Interior has to do is to allow our state security forces and bodies to use anti-disturbing material to protect a border which is what is done in Greece and Poland And what our Armed Forces have to do is not training maneuvers what this Government has to do is deploy our Armed Forces in situations of tension on the southern border because you all agree to send arms to defend Ukraine 's sovereignty but no one here agrees to defend Spanish sovereignty on the southern border I 'm going to stop at your star size You propose to include Ceuta and Melilla in the Schengen area Do you really think that 's how they 're gonna better protect the border Do they really say that A party that has ruled this country and that wants to protect a border proposes that Ceuta and Melilla be included in the Schengen area that is they want to remove border control more from those who jump the fence Also if you want we lower the fence a little bit to make them jump more easily What needs to be done with Ceuta and Melilla is to introduce them under NATO 's umbrella for protection to see if the international organizations in which Spain is going to defend our interests are really going to do so because it happens what always happens that Spain is abroad that Spain is in international organizations and at the time of truth no one defends their interests You are left with the perfect package of effect called and the reality is that it suits me because you and your spokespersons have repeatedly said that mass immigration is the way to combat ageing it is the way to combat the demographic challenge You have said so both in initiatives in the Senate and in your spokesmen such as Mr Feijóo And it suits me because you are actually in the same package as all parties in this House except one which is the package as good signatories to Agenda 2030 to combat the demographic decline of Europe with massive immigration with all that it entails But there 's one thing I do n't care about about your initiative and it's that sometimes you say words as an assailant as an invasion as a collapse of social services like immigration makes living together difficult tell Mrs. Ayuso
of Nijar Lorca El Fraile tell them what common sense says that our sovereignty must be protected Thank you very much
Thank you Mr. President The Spaniards have been afraid for a long time and it seems to you too long that you do n't care To all of you because this is not a new topic 2010 ten lives truncated by Latin bands 2012 arrested fifteen members of Latin bands accused of theft and injuries 2016 the revenge for the murder of a Trinitarian in Sol plans on the environment 2017 the new splendor of Latin bands more murders and more detainees 2018 detained twenty members of Latin bands for the death of a young man at the festivals of San Agustín de Guadalix Holders of 2010 2012 2016 2017 2018 You have to have the nerve to think that the Spaniards are going to swallow that this is not your fault ladies and gentlemen of the PP You have governed different administrations all these years and instead of accusing the Spaniards who warned of the problem of racists xenophobics or conspirators you had an obligation to solve the problem And if you do n't know how to improve living and living in neighbourhoods as you have already shown you have to give way to others who will Are you going to talk about the insecurity of the miners Curious that now they talk about the Latin bands because now you see the headlines again and yet do n't talk about the minas Does it have anything to do with you bringing them in and keeping them Ladies and gentlemen any problem has its origin and as Chesterton said it is not that they cannot see the solution it is that they cannot see the problem it is that they are unable to diagnose the problem well Because one of the fundamental origins of the insecurity of the ghettos non-zones and fear are the open borders You do n't say that because it 's the age of the politically correct because it 's wrong seen because you can't say certain things even if they 're true because of a possible media lynching The problem is that VOX gives us exactly the same media lynching and we will tell the truth always and at any price Ladies and gentlemen any serious criminologist investigates the cultural factor of certain crimes and does so in honor of the truth And the cultural element of origin is undeniable for several reasons Firstly as a statistical reality in many types of crime Secondly non-zones cultural impositions war in the ghettos and neighbourhoods ethnic wars are a reality in many neighbourhoods Thirdly there are new types of crime that did not exist in societies such as ours such as the ablation of clitoris forced marriages machete conflicts Mrs Fanjul the problem is not that machetes are sold very easily in Spain that is not the problem That is misdiagnosing a problem and also knowingly There are countries that are failed states that already work with the eye for eye tooth for tooth or have worked like this always with the law of the strongest There are countries with very high crime rates countries where life has very little value and there are countries in which the religious component like Saudi Arabia generates that we can execute and that they are prisoners of death for example those who deny a particular religion Ladies and gentlemen putting massively different cultures in order to create a possible model of multicultural society is a sham In addition it is a very fat thyme with consequences suffered by humble Spaniards The multicultural experiment in their roles in their heads is very nice In their heads it may be to eat basmati rice or soy milk but for the reality of the Spaniards for the humble neighborhoods it is criminality They 're machetes they 're herd rapes they 're forced marriages and clitoris ablation Ladies and gentlemen we will deceive the Spanish if we say that this problem has an easy solution Ladies and gentlemen of the PP twenty years of free bar paper and open borders have very difficult consequences to reverse It is you who have turned nationality into a process and devalued its value Ladies and gentlemen nationality is not a role We are attacked when we say so but nationality is a reality of belonging and it is clear that that role that process that that DNI has to resemble this reality as much as possible You 're shocked when we say that the homeland is not a contract Colleagues like Rufian say the homeland is the keys to their home For Podemos it is public health I do n't know if they consider private health users Spanish as the former vice president Carmen Calvo but the truth is that the nation is deeply uncomfortable for you
How it is noted that when there are no arguments there are the usual insults those we are already used to receiving in this House Ladies and gentlemen you and you have been doing this all morning tell the Spaniards that you have to pay taxes to make organ transplants to pay for chemotherapy sessions in public health and logically who is going to oppose it But the reality the reality is that you are going to spend four times the budget of the Ministry of Health and more than twice the budget of the Ministry of Defence on an ideological plan that you have called the Strategic Plan for Effective Equality between Women and Men It is indecent Minister that you are going to allocate 20 319 million euros that you will then make up and say it is to improve people 's lives I will tell you some phrases of your strategic plan and the intentions of your ministry creating an advisory table of ecofeminism integrating the gender perspective of course into absolutely everything The document is full of General budgets of the State with a gender perspective General administration of the State with a gender perspective regulations with a gender perspective European Social Fund with a gender perspective contracts with a gender perspective But do n't miss it which you also want to fight against the feminization of poverty in a country where 82 of sinogarism is male At the same time you want to involve the media in overcoming gender stereotypes but you also advocate measures to eradicate I do n't know what symbolic violence and cultural violence against women you also want to transform the mandate of hegemonic masculinity and you want to create a feminist library do CIS surveys for women and post feminist degrees And do n't miss it I do n't know what it will be push the observatory for the image of women Minister thousands of Spaniards that 's why it 's indecent can't pay for the light can't take a plate to their homes can't heat their families have to close the shutters of their businesses and the doors of their trucks forever to stay without anything so that you spend your tax money to pay feminism that neither eats nor heats nor serves for anything Thank you so much
Thank you Madam President After all we have had to hear here this afternoon the first thing I want to say on behalf of the VOX Parliamentary Group is that the southern border of Spain defends itself is that Ceuta and Melilla always Spanish Last week Mr. Rufián said that if we were against immigration who would bring us the packages of things we asked for on the Internet who would take care of our elders who would clean the houses or who would take care of the gardens Because Mr. Rufián and the rest of the progress gentlemen want to open the borders for this They want labor for the worst paid jobs The truth is what they want is massive immigration because they want slaves Mr. Rufián says this not only because he is a classist but because he has masters because a handful of billionaires are badly affected by the demographic curve of the West and need to call hundreds of thousands of immigrants to square their results accounts and forecasts In the VOX Parliamentary Group we have three messages for the progressive gentlemen First of all cleaning houses is worthy fixing gardens is worthy caring for our elders is very dignified and what is deeply outraged is that instead of fighting to improve the conditions of the worst paid jobs they bring millions and millions of immigrants to lower wages and further precarious jobs
Thank you Madam President As I said to them it is unworthy to use millions and millions of immigrants to precariously employ the Spanish but it is miserable to relegate the more modest Spaniards not only to have increasingly precarious jobs but to condemn them to live among the crime insecurity and barbarism that causes uncontrolled immigration in the humblest neighborhoods of our country Let them not deceive let them not deceive those who claim to fight for the eradication of poverty or those who claim to fight for social justice because ladies and gentlemen it is impossible to fight poverty by bringing seven million Africans with no resources to roam our streets It 's impossible it 's a lie and it 's very serious But it is also impossible to fight for social justice by bringing millions of people from poor countries to lower wages and precarious jobs It 's impossible it 's a lie and it 's very serious Let them not deceive you for if today the government regularizes half a million immigrants it sends a very dangerous message that will cause an effect called overwhelming and irresponsible and the more effect called more deaths on the borders This is the case but not in countries where there is no so called effect where the Army controls borders intercepts vessels and takes them to ports in other States such as Australia Do you know how many are dead in the Pacific Zero And do you know how many the economic benefits of the mafias and their accomplices are None Ladies and gentlemen protecting borders works So do n't stop fooling yourself because open border policies are the culprits of every drama every death every truncated life They are guilty of stealing the labor of their countries of the existence of human trafficking mafias of every prostituted woman and exploited immigrant decade Let them not deceive you but above all that they do not mislead you because the main victims of all this are the Spaniards the grandmothers who walk with fear for Usera and for Parla the girls raped in a herd the victims of forced marriages those who have arms amputated by the street feuds Francisco and his three year old grandson murdered by jihadist terrorism in the Rambla de Barcelona and the homeless families with no future and no work who see how even having shared their whole life they have condemned them to uproot poverty loneliness fear and failure Therefore in the VOX Parliamentary Group we have very clearly that the best way to protect the Spaniards is to protect the doors of their home Thank you so much
Thank you Mr. President The truth is this makes me think that xenophobia is fear of the other is n't it Here really what there is is an atrocious fear of thinking differently which you manifest in each of your interventions But we 're going to keep thinking differently and unfortunately you 're going to have to keep listening to us for a long time I know it 's hard for you to understand but we are very proud of our nation very proud of our history very proud of our families and very proud of our culture and that no progress has been made to make us ashamed of it Let 's keep proclaiming the truth let 's shield the one who shields the truth I was also a little concerned about one of the interventions Mrs de Esquerra's which said that 19 March was going to be a sort of international coven against racism Well March 19th for VOX it will continue to be St. Joseph's Day and Father 's Day and no progressive religion will end our millennial culture You want us to believe that some people are fleeing the war and that we have a duty to welcome ourselves as a multicultural society and also to devote our public resources to taking advantage of them giving them shelter supporting them and respecting their customs And if you do n't like it you 're a racist and you 're a xenophobic which is what you always tell the Spaniards We are used to being told it gives us a little bit of the same but the problem is that they tell almost five million voters that they will probably have VOX It is not true what you tell them permanently crushing the Spanish with all their subsidized media It is not true that some come that is the first lie come en masse comes a mass immigration If we collect only the last twenty years in 2000 foreigners living in Spain accounted for 2 of the total population and in 2021 they account for almost 12 of the population almost six million people and in addition their own media say they want to increase it until 2050 in another seven million inhabitants I mean there 's not a few coming Neither come as the former secretary of state of his party said raped women fleeing the war to begin with because what comes are men But what war is there in Morocco What war is there in Algeria What war is there in Mauritania What war is there in Senegal The issuing countries of most immigrants coming to this country are not at war There are a small number of refugees coming from countries at war but they are not the problem we have on the table And you permanently want to confuse the Spaniards with your Welcome headlines refuges If we convince everyone that raped women are coming who are fleeing the war who is going to be against this The problem is that they deliberately deceive the population to condition their opinions But there are more lies There are more lies because those who arrive profit from the mafias which are the big business of all this massive immigration that you want to bring for the economic benefit of Europe because it is sent to you by the big capitals I have told you on more than one occasion because it is the reality and moreover it has been acknowledged by Mr de Bildu in his intervention But there 's just another lie We do not have to respect their customs when they are contrary to ours We do n't have to respect female genital ablation We do not have to respect forced marriages which have already increased by 60 in Spain We do n't have to respect the law of the strongest We do not have to respect or resolve machete conflicts because we do not have to respect these customs Another lie is that you say that we have to devote our public resources to them but our public resources have to go first to the Spaniards who need them You do n't have to go to this huge host mass of immigrants when in Spain we have 40 000 homeless people and 30 youth unemployment when you turn up the light to the people 46 when the gasoline goes up when the shopping basket goes up Where there is poverty is among the Spaniards and that is what you do not want to solve or dedicate your resources to it And of course we are neither racist nor xenophobic because we characterize ourselves precisely because we love and want to preserve Spain the Spain we have received from our parents and we also have the right to do so We have the right to want to preserve it and to ensure that our streets are not battlefields We have the right that our daughter not be the 12 year old girl of Azuqueca raped in mass We have a right that our grandmother is not the 80 year old woman raped and stolen in Alicante We have the right that our grandmother is not the 90 year old woman raped in Figueres by another immigrant and we have the right that our brother is not the man of Murcia to whom he was amputated by a machete That 's what we 're entitled to And why do we bring you here today this non-law proposal Because we do n't think anywhere is it written that Spain has to resign Because nations and civilizations die and disappear and if there are a number of States that are pushing Spain Morocco Algeria Tunisia or Mauritania by bringing mass immigration and not accepting repatriations back we have to respond with our own sovereignty and we have to use all the tools of international law that are within our reach such as the draft articles of the Commission that recognize the possibility of demanding and carrying out self guard measures against States that are attacking your own sovereignty as is the case Spain must press internationally because it is good enough that Spain is the laughing stock of the world it is good enough that Spain is in Brussels not to demand its own and it is good enough that Spain has surrendered the southern border Because who sold the Canary Islands Which office did you sell Canaries in Who has decided that now the Canary Islands has to be a great concentration camp Who gave up Ceuta Who gave up Melilla In what closed office tell the Spaniards have you sold the southern border of Spain And finally I know that you hate our identity our symbols our flag our history and our hymns but I will end up with a piece of a legionary anthem Third Heroes as a tribute to the foreigners who come to Spain to love her to care for her to respect her and even sometimes to give their lives for her especially serving the Spanish Legion
Those who in Spain have not been born and blood and life you give in his honor children of Spain are beloved you have won his excellent love They are the first injured and the first saddened with this process of disintegration of Spain
Thank you Madam President We have come this morning almost late to discuss a motion resulting from an urgent inquiry by the People 's Party on aid to families in order to reach the end of the month to families who are indeed in one of the most difficult moments of recent years The point is that it is a little ironic to read the measures proposed by the People 's Party which are essentially tax cuts by a party that climbed the IRPF up to five times in the previous legislature even more so than the United Left asked It is ironic that they are proposed by the party that raised VAT to 21 the party that raised IBI It is ironic on the part of the party of the copayment of medicines to pensioners on the part of the party of the elimination of the deduction of professional diesel on the part of the party that allowed the autonomous communities to tax the hydrocarbons and the party that allowed the eviction of half Spain to come to talk about vulnerable and banks Ladies and gentlemen however and this is shared by both the People 's Party and the Socialist Party the parties of the revolving doors with these measures that you propose thank God and we all know that they are promises in the opposition and that they are most likely traditions in the Moncloa they will be scolded by their colleagues on the boards of directors Ladies and gentlemen the Spanish are very tired They do n't know how tired the Spaniards are of hearing us talk about patches permanently Look in VOX we do think we should lower taxes on the Spaniards We think we should cut public spending on things that are unnecessary and of course would help But we do not come here to say that half a point must be lowered to such a tax No no We come here to say that for families to truly reach the end of the month structural measures must be urgently addressed We have come to say that the strengthening of Spanish families necessarily involves turning back to what you have been doing for decades tens of years by auctioning our sovereignty in different areas And here 's VOX talking about sovereignty again But it is common sense ladies and gentlemen that in order to combat energy poverty that for Spanish families to be able to sell their homes and arrive at the end of the month we cannot pass a law that prevents Spanish people from exploring and exploiting their own resources We cannot base our energy policy on flying thermal power plants and shutting down nuclear power plants We have to bet on a country that truly owns its resources and that can have control over energy precisely in order to be able to control the supply and to be able to strengthen the Spanish families Ladies and gentlemen there is no use in your electoral and short term policies at four years notice there is no real use in patches in the IRPF if we continue to open the door to unfair competition that destroys our jobs and our industry Ladies and gentlemen let me see if I can get important questions asked without any prejudice According to the latest quality of life survey of the National Statistical Institute the population at risk of poverty and social exclusion accounts for 27.8 of the population which is more than 13 million people Do you believe that in Spain with more than 13 million people at risk of poverty we can truly have open border policies with which we bring seven million Africans without resources Do you really believe that this is not going to have a direct impact on the poverty of the Spaniards Do you think it is possible to put an end to social exclusion to poverty to child poverty to severe poverty to that one and a half million people who cannot even eat meat It is impossible if certain policies are implemented Ladies and gentlemen the only way to protect the Spanish hard is to protect their country hard The heroes of this story are unfortunately not the rulers the heroes of this story are the mothers of families who spend the last two weeks of the month on rice and pasta the heroes of this story are the grandparents who support the accounts of whole families with all their members unemployed with their pensions and the heroes of this story are the parents who do not even see their children so that their children can eat Ladies and gentlemen it is all the modest Spaniards to whom you have taken everything from them but who do not resign
Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen open your eyes for the umpteenth time Indeed when you realize the reality of what is happening in this country and on this continent it will be late I know you do n't like to talk about demography They speak permanently of the planet say such say which and never refer to the configurative element of states which are people People demography is what influences economies is what influences culture social configuration political organizations Once I mentioned here I am going to do it again today the wonderful Leopold Abbey who said Do not ask what world we will leave your children the question is which children we will leave this world I think it is one of the phrases that best describes the gravity of the situation and the significance of the situation we are experiencing The demography of the nations also has another revealing phrase that my dear José Javier Esparza recently quoted at the meeting Southern Frontier which we organized with the group of conservatives and reformists on the island of Gran Canaria Precisely to claim the protection of the southern border which is the border that Spain has completely abandoned He said that states are not empty containers that if we put 80 million Nigerians in Germany they do n't make Germany they make Nigeria Nations are determined to be a populated territory They are people with their culture with their religion with their political configuration with their norms of coexistence And all that is to replace those populations is necessarily to put an end to those nations and their identities Ladies and gentlemen the phenomenon we are witnessing is not a minor migratory phenomenon which of course has always existed throughout life They 're massive movements They are true invasions that are no myth that have also existed throughout history and have changed the course of it even though perhaps this is the first time that the original Government has starred in it Minister Escrivá has said that he wants to repopulate uninhabited territories of Spain abandoned with immigrants It says this in its 2050 Plan which they want to bring in 250 000 immigrants in the coming months it is said by their media like El País that Spain needs 7 million immigrants in three decades to maintain prosperity That is to say they want to bring in 7 million immigrants by 2050 when their own media as they publish in Moncloa say that foreigners living in Spain now exceed 5.8 million Ladies and gentlemen there are not four refugees fleeing a war no There are millions that you need because Davos orders them because the World Bank orders them and because big capitals order them and that 's the reality Because what you need is slave labor for the maintenance of economies and that in a context of aging of birth and unprecedented non-indigenous birth Ladies and gentlemen look around open your eyes and look at France look at Germany or look at Sweden The multicultural religion that you are expanding around the world that eventual system in which we are all going to enrich each other 's cultures is a lie Peaceful multiculturalism does not exist Cultures have been imposing on one another since the beginning of time and France is one of the best tests in our environment In France there are more than seven hundred municipalities in which French law does not apply It either applies the Islamic Shariah or the law of the strongest There are more than seven hundred departments in which law enforcement can neither enter nor apply the law of that country and that is going to happen sooner than later in Spain Ladies and gentlemen I understand that for your theatre you need the story of goodness which is hypocrisy but all the immigrants who die at sea is your fault because you are the ones who throw them into the sea who collaborate with the human trafficking mafias and with the NGOs and those responsible for their consciences all this tragedy And all that because a number of billionaires are badly affected by Europe 's demographic decline for their economies But the rapporteur is one thing and the reality of the streets is another and the reality is that mass immigration loads our neighborhoods and creates Spain 's machetes which is what you are creating And we saw him the other day in Murcia with the amputation of his hand we saw him with the machetes in Barcelona we saw him with the boy who also beat machetes in Carabanchel we saw him with the massive rapes we saw him with so many situations that create insecurity and load our neighborhoods
But I have good news and I am finished for the Basque Nationalist Party a message of hope and it is that it will be a great Basque from Amurrio specifically who will end all the policies with which you are charging Spain Thank you so much
"With venial Mr. President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Today we are presented for our consideration with a proposal for a law that was registered by the People 's Parliamentary Group last March The proposed law has five pages with the explanatory statement sixteen articles four additional provisions one transitional and one final entry into force In addition it has an unfortunate name it is called a bill on violence in the health field It is unfortunate because the People 's Parliamentary Group in its explanatory statement says that the problem that is to be solved is a cause and I quote textually in which health professionals are especially exposed to aggression and situations of violence and that it is an occupational danger that must be prevented and avoided Therefore this proposal for a law should have been called a proposal for a law on violence against health personnel not only because this name does describe the object of the proposal but because it comes out of the fraudulent and tortuous use made by the left of the term violence We know that the left uses in its propaganda the National Socialist principle of transposition whose name in German I do n't remember for example accusing the victim of having the intention to attack the murderer We see every day in this House how the crimes are justified and how the friends of convicts pander before us For the communist all he opposes to his ends is violence Ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People 's Party you should already know that because you have been abusing yourselves for decades So you should be careful to use such ambiguous names since the left makes continuous incursions in this area to give the message that health professionals exercise for example violence against women Although from a laughable point of view it is not innocent that Mrs Calvo insinuated that doctors in the 1970s arbitrarily removed the vesicle and of course of course not Francois From the most sinister bank the extreme left insists on denouncing the concept of obstetric violence for example a concept illuminated in the matrix of Bolivarian communism and whose false implant in the collective imagination has been denounced by the College Medical Organization and by this modest doctor I do it here for the simple reason ladies and gentlemen that at least in Spain this is an infamous slander Gentlemen of Podemos ladies of Podemos go to the countries whose name religion is submission and you will see there first hand what gynecological violence is starting with genital mutilation Therefore let 's focus on violence against health personnel because we find worrying data since in 2021 according to a ministry report 1.57 out of every 100 professionals suffered it There were 10,170 assaults and that most verbal assaults are not reported following the 2015 reform Let us illuminate yes with our focus the violence against health personnel because it is increasing and let us know the context in which it occurs Why did most of the assaults occur in primary care Why is 90 of the attacks occurring in the public and only 10 in the private sector Let us therefore look at the context let us improve the mediocre report of the Ministry of Health let us support the College Medical Organization which has made it possible for violence against doctors to be declared an attack on authority and denounce the lack of diligence of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health which have made Instruction 1/2017 undeveloped Is there reason for the Spanish to be dissatisfied with health carelessness A lot VOX has denounced it from this rostrum when we were presented with the infumable Darias law But there is not a single one to attack the healthcare staff none at all And it 's intolerable for them to be slandered Moreover this violence against health workers has been protected here by saying that there are objective elements that justify it starting with Mr de Bildu How No no party without Aunt Joan ladies and gentlemen here in the house for example we hope that the vocation of service and devotion to the law will make the lawyers live up to the very grave moment that we live in But we do n't expect that from the health care providers no we do n't we do n't expect them to do their duty no Why Because we know for sure that they will fulfill their duty as they have done throughout the history of Spanish health and in the epidemic And what already cries out to heaven is that here all the left wing groups have said that they will not support this bill because there are objective reasons to beat the toilets That 's intolerable That is the rulers should not continue to abuse the vocation of health professionals This abuse has been reflected in the fact that all color governments have made Spanish doctors the worst paid in Europe To begin with politicians need to know what they are and for example some community president would have to know for God 's sake that looks are not students they are doctors And of course to dignify working conditions is an essential step That is the message that politicians and these General Courts must give approving at least the consideration of this initiative We will support the consideration of this bill because we believe it can minimize aggression against health personnel and we hope to be able to make amendments to the process For starters I would ask you to change the name and save us an amendment Thank you very much"
With all due respect Madam President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen A preview I do n't know how you socialist ladies and gentlemen dare to appoint Professor Ernesto Lluch after signing a pact with the heirs of his murderers What color was the ink they used Ladies and gentlemen we are in an unprecedented health crisis within an unprecedented political crisis in which the Government itself is allied with the enemies of the nation The government has already destroyed the sanity and it has done so since the day it let in Wuhan 's coronavirus Ladies and gentlemen there is no National Health System it is an entelequia which as it does not have has no address telephone or website The definitive proof of this is that in this session we are discussing less than 10 of public health expenditure The rest of the expenditure is freely arranged by the autonomous rates with the transfers made to them by the State and the IRPF section In 2022 self government spent 73 198 million on health care However we have a health expenditure of 40 lower than the eurozone 's median At the same time the autonomous communities spend 40 on public debt I repeat health spending on autonomy 73 198 million amount we are discussing today including Muface 5933 There is no National Health System Mrs Darias there is an inter-autonomic system that lacks information about resources about its professionals about its functions about its results a system of ministates all socialist ideas and that has been immobilised for decades Are you laughing I 'm right fine Health care Minister since we are in good shape who has kept it It has been maintained by health personnel and in particular doctors and their vocation In this system these staff cynically asked to applaud on the balconies earn 20 less than in 2008 and 40 have temporary contracts Are you surprised that you are fleeing Spain when doctors are the worst paid in Europe when the deaths of Spanish healthcare professionals have been the largest in the world and have found no reward By the way economic reward which is how to do when you work well Is it lawful to ask health professionals to trust a government that allowed them to protect themselves with garbage bags No no Yes ladies and gentlemen the health situation is critical And I tell you one thing the main source of contempt and loss of legitimacy are waiting lists a chronic disease aggravated by the epidemic 2.35 million surgeries are still pending we have a shameful surgical waiting list record with 706 000 patients and 4 month median waiting patient waiting list for specialist 4 month median waiting And what do you do What do you budget to put an end to temporality Nothing With inequity in access Nothing With the delay in approving new drugs Almost nothing It is an insult that the Sánchez government has decided to increase its budget less than that of the lady who defends pederasty It 's a shame It is a disgrace that the cinema grants are 158 million and the Strategic Framework for Primary Care is 179 million Horrible television 691 million primary assistance in total just under 500 million These budgets do not solve the urgent problems of our health I have spent decades hearing from the consultation from the plant the buzz the runrun of these experts all always the same always on the left talking about the problems like surrounding a wall that they would like to make fall on the basis of conferences Not anymore However they said interesting things For example what should we do now according to our point of view To launch three emergency plans to put an end to waiting lists by relying on private health yes Mrs Medel to put an end to the temporary situation to increase the salaries of health workers which deserve this increase more than other public employees yes I say and more than all of us by the way to increase public expenditure per capita which is 40 lower than in the eurozone and to stop identifying public service with public management A strong ministry Minister as we propose should have a strong voice in the Fiscal and Financial Policy Council a strong voice taking advantage of the weight of the money transfers made to the autonomous communities At the same time the Cohesion Fund should be provided with a sufficient fund for specific policies None of that gives us these budgets They are budgets based on tirites bought in a Chinese as if not by a government that only thinks about surviving and is indifferent to the health of the Spaniards at least that 's what I think The inter-autonomic health system Minister is a framework that prevents us from having in Spain a real National Health System that must leave behind other spoiled formulas from a left wing era that has passed Budget Of the ruin that are not only the symptom of the failure of a system they are the symptom of the failure of a government that does not believe in Spanish health because it has neither believed nor wants to believe in Spain Thank you very much
With venial Mr. President Minister I 'm not mad You said the contagion not me Look it 's called my pamphlet surgery Well I invite everyone who sees this and hears you compare your intervention with mine and tell them what was the most pamphlet Undoubtedly your intervention Look Your Honor our parliamentary group speaks louder when it writes and what we have written is in our parliamentary proposals and interventions As I said before what we have proposed is free vaccination In vaccines I have repeated it many times throughout my intervention we did not object to the centralized purchase but to making complementary purchases You 're wrong or you 're confusing us Well we love to see that we do n't fit in your prejudices Here you failed to mention Tejero and all this is the typical thing that we are always accustomed to but this is going to end If we 're going to rule in nothing Look I 'm going to tell you one thing about the autonomous state of confusion It is not I ladies and gentlemen who was former Minister García Vargas one of the most respected people who at this parliamentary seat a few days ago said that the National Health System could be better baptized since it had no national character and you know it as an inter autonomous health system And you confuse with the post hoc fallacy ergo propter hoc that all that has been good in Spain has been because it coincides in time with autonomy No man no it has coincided with economic development with social development with the invention of new medicines with the invention of new vaccines and with the invention of new neoplastic drugs You the autonomous state are an obstacle to good governance of health And look you have n't mentioned this national public health centre that you want to implement and missed me Do you know why I do n't think you mentioned it Because you will not be allowed to do so by your separatist partners who are not at all interested in the coordination and unification of health Those separatist and racist partners who call us carnegos and models With these are those with which you govern they are the enemies of Spain and yes I strongly affirm that they are the enemies of our health I 'm done Thank you very much
Thank you Mr. President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Madam Minister just because of the fourth final provision the object of which is the transplant it would deserve to be returned this bill so much is the ignorance or malice that rhymes But let 's go to the core If the Government which claims to believe in the public sector had really wanted to improve public health it would have brought concrete measures to improve it and not future mirages It could have brought about a reform of the General Health Act or a reform of the harmful human resources policy Instead it seeks to dispense with the collaboration of private health in a hypocritical and surreptitious manner It is hypocritical to suppress private concerts when officials and we the Members of Parliament enjoy a capacity of choice between the public and the private that the rest of the citizens do not have The Lordships of Podemos have it clear they want to suppress these mutualities they are communists They will then have the private doctor who goes to Galapagar 's villa the private nurse and other minucias right On the contrary VOX wants all Spaniards to be able to be served with their health card anywhere in Spain and in addition it will work to ensure that all Spaniards have the same privilege that officials and you now enjoy freedom of choice The Darias project wants to suppress collaboration with the private in a surreptitiously way The minister does not dare to ban concerts but demands that public health managers meet requirements that are impossible to meet simply because they do not exist Ladies and gentlemen public and private health are already integrated via concerts This collaboration optimizes resources and helps the sustainability of the system Data 38 of private hospitals have some concert with public health concerts are 10 of health expenditure 8587 million 60 of which is for hospital expenses 8.7 of surgical interventions are performed under concert 9.2 of radiotherapy sessions with linear accelerator and according to a study currently in print prices at private concerts are 32 or 90 of a median 40 cheaper to equal diagnosis and procedure The contribution of the private sector is so great that it is neither rational nor feasible to dispense with it as the consequence will be to decrease health care and its quality and the final effect will be to go against the same principles that you claim to defend We reject this bill and we do so in its entirety because first it is a statist almost communist project that wants to de facto ban health concerts it contravenes the spirit of the General Health Law 14/1986 which includes and includes the conventions in the concerts articles 66 67 and 90 and which requires that health services should be given according to efficiency speed and economy it contravenes the spirit of the Law on Cohesion and Quality of the National Health System 16/2003 of 28 May which in its article 2 g establishes public private collaboration as a general principle and that health care should be given within a specified maximum time Everyone here including the minister knows that ending the concerts is going to lengthen the waiting lists The kick to private health will be given to patients of public health Secondly this project has no empirical basis The memory cites three studies none conclusive and the best which is a review of studies says that the studies they have reviewed are not of sufficient quality and therefore nothing can be concluded Thirdly the bill is contradictory On the one hand it recognizes that public management is inefficient but the mechanisms of its improvement are not put in place and it only provides as a solution to make concerts with the private as an improvement impossible A lady limps down the street carries a crutch comes the person who has made this project and kicks the crutch What 's going to happen Will she come out saying I 'm cured I 'm cured Or will the chrism break with the sidewalk For that woman is public health right now because they are talking about establishing measures to establish good governance in the future Observe what the Economic and Social Council 's opinion says I hope After more than twenty five years of development there has so far been a lack of a system of evaluation of health results to facilitate the proper use of public resources close quotes Ladies and gentlemen believe me I have been working for forty three years exclusively for public hospitals only in public hospitals and this is not just about indicators It is arranged when at all levels of public health first the wage increases which is of misery the good worker is rewarded and the bad one is punished and that with the current system is impossible I stress it The first and central article of this projector is criticized by the Economic and Social Council itself when it says that it is indeterminate and imprecise about the criteria for establishing concerts I do not think so Minister as the Economic and Social Council says because how can I demand that they say that the resources have been used optimally optimally when the criteria are not even set to see whether they have been done well only well Fourthly this project is absolutely inopportune 706 740 patients waiting the waiting time is now four months the specialist list has increased by 27 in 2021 3.2 million with a waiting time of three months Consequences of avoiding concerts increase the waiting time in surgeries to six months in consultations to five increase morbidity and mortality and increase public health spending in an interval of 1500 to 3000 million euros If we want to reduce the waiting list it is reasonable to do the opposite to go to private health care which has sufficient resources Fifthly this project lacks a credible economic basis and runs counter to the principles of resource efficiency Organic Law 2/2012 Only from the socialist bald concept that public money is nobody 's can it be said as is done here you laugh that the economic impact is going to be 20 million euros But hey if there 's going to be a 40 extra administrative cost Sixth and I 'm finishing huge judicialization This is what 's going to happen You 've already dealt with the independenceists okay Seventhly the concept of equity is inseparable from that of justice and it is impossible for this bill to produce justice when it does not put in place the means to improve public health and technical and human resources for our public health to have efficient contrasted and audited health management On the other hand the concept of universality has been perverted What was initially the logical desire for all Spaniards to have health care regardless of their state of insurance has been extended to all the inhabitants of the world they lack health coverage for the Klingon ladies and gentlemen And while granting total total health care rights throughout the Spanish territory including transplantation to illegal immigrants the Spaniards are prevented from circulating and having health care with the health card in the Spanish territory Moreover in this bill the Spanish residents Dutch Mrs Darias who are working for example in Germany are required that when they get sick in Spain they show that the disease has happened to them while visiting their grandmother and that is not done with illegal immigrants What is that Mrs. Darias I 'm going to tell you what it is well I 'm not going to tell you well yes almost hispanophobia I conclude ladies and gentlemen This bill is not only unfair to the Spaniards and legal residents but it is a fine example of the hatred that socialism has for everything private To dispense with private health is not only a political and economic mistake but will multiply waiting lists diminishing health care and its quality Therefore in VOX we say that this bill should not be dealt with we hope your support because it lacks a rational foundation and because the spirit that guides it which is partisan and spurious will generate the opposite of what you say less equity less accessibility and therefore more disease and less health In VOX we want a simple thing and it is summed up in a phrase freedom also in health Thank you very much
Thank you President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Group when you brought your non-law proposal here to improve the working conditions of female domestic workers back in May we already told you what VOX thinks about it that all Spanish workers must be defended that all Spanish workers have the right to stable jobs with decent wages that we must combat job insecurity and ensure the reconciliation of families that we must promote the rise of all wages especially the lowest ones and that we must promote stable lasting and quality employment We told you to first of all make it clear that you always lie when you talk about VOX but also to show that it is you all of you and not us who having ruled this country for many years have discriminated against the household employees collective You have discriminated against them by denying access to unemployment benefits to date We also told them that in VOX we give immense value to the work of domestic workers a work that we know is hard and ungrateful but also very dignified and indispensable for the community because it depends on it that families can reconcile their working life with their family life But we also told them what our position was with regard to Spanish families and their needs and we demanded a regulation that encourages and facilitates the recruitment of these much needed workers because all the women we work outside the home whatever our condition we need help even a few hours and because there are families that make a huge economic effort to be able to reconcile their working life with their personal life to the point that on many occasions they are almost more interested in staying at home than going out to work Already then we demanded a regulation that would be good for both domestic workers and their employers a regulation that favors this process by making it simple and that would not put all the economic burden on families However now they come and bring this to us and bring it to us in the form of a royal decree so that we do not have the opportunity to amend contribute or correct They bring us a law that on the one hand proposes the improvement of the conditions of domestic workers but on the other discourages their recruitment and encourages the submerged economy seriously damaging Frankly we do not know whether what they intended under this law was for women to stay at home because they were unable to pay for help or for many domestic workers to be left out of work or to end up working without a contract simply because of the need of one or the other Ladies and gentlemen you are full of people talking about women 's rights but with this way of legislating or defending working mothers or domestic workers and look you do not even defend immigrants because the vast majority of domestic workers are legal immigrant women who have left it all behind to build a future among us who work very hard to live decently and be able to send money to their families and who have made a gap between us on the basis of a great deal of effort Ladies and gentlemen do you know what 's going on That you can't legislate on matters that belong to families when you hate our families you can't make a law to improve the working conditions of housewives when you want there to be no homes to work in That 's what happens to you What happens to you is that you hate our families especially if they are numerous because only from the hatred of families in general and the many in particular and only from the prejudice that all families who hire help at home are rich can you make a law like this at a time like this with inflation triggered with the shopping basket fired with fuel fired with light and gas fired Moreover they were fired not by war nor by the pandemic no they were fired by their fault alone and exclusively by their fault and by their disastrous policies Do they not realize that all our families have it much harder today that there are families that have it even worse because they have more mouths to feed families whose homes are much harder to maintain because their expenses multiply exponentially How can they claim that families who already take care of their household employees social security benefits almost as if they were businesses also take care of 20 of the costs of unemployment contributions and FOGASA And worse how can large families which I remind them that they are no longer the only ones with many children thus be harmed by removing the 45 bonus guaranteed by article 9 of the Law on the Protection of Large Families What need did they have to repeal this article What better way do we have to spend our tax money than by guaranteeing our workers rights What better way to spend it than by helping our families so that they can work and reconcile This ladies and gentlemen is a dirty move one of these dirty moves that you so much like to force the parliamentary groups in this House to have to decide who they want more whether Dad or Mom to force the groups in this House to choose who we have to leave at the stand who we prefer to harm whether the domestic workers leaving them in the precarious work they now live in or the large families who are the ones who make the most effort to get their own people out of the way who bear the most costs who contribute the most to our system who have the greatest need for reconciliation and who now want to force them to meet property or income requirements to qualify for a bonus which they have not even had the decency to tell us how they are going to implement and who are absolutely unfair But of course this is a usual practice its Machiavellian and twisted way of acting mixing matters to confuse the citizens and to throw us in the face afterwards as they do in every intervention repeating as trained parrots the cutting of matters to which we have voted but not obviating that they made us choose between a greater and a lesser evil It is clear to us what you want you want confrontation because you live from confrontation and now it is up to us to confront the large families because you know that we cannot vote against this right and leave a group that deserves and needs them without rights What you want is to end the traditional family and especially the numerous families because for you are the cradle of the values you are wishing to liquidate
I 'm done Mr. President But we have bad news for you ladies and gentlemen because in Spain as in Europe it is time for patriots because for us ladies and gentlemen our families are the last hope of this society and our values are those who keep us strong in this battle to save our civilization and our culture Do not have the slightest doubt that when we govern we will put our families and especially the large families back at the heart of all our policies Thank you very much
Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen calm and prudence This is what we have been asked by the highest responsible for the development of the entire legal system in this country with regard to the fiasco of its law on sexual freedom This is the solution proposed by our Minister of Justice while convicted sexual aggressors and pederasts are released before their due to go out on the street to endanger once again the integrity of the women and children of this country Calm and tranquillity for all those victims who after passing through the worst experience of their lives after passing through a trial in which they relived the horror and in which they faced face to face with those who hurt them so much after finally achieving the sentence that relieves but never serves to erase the suffering will have to see how their aggressors benefit from this new law Calm and tranquillity for all women and children who already know that if one day they have the misfortune of being victims of these predators they will not even have the consolation of seeing how they rot in prison because their Government puts the interests of criminals above those of the victims What a tremendous irresponsibility of our Minister of Justice who has let his equal counterpart and his vehemently advisers get away with it What a irresponsibility to let those who have already demonstrated truly alarming legal illiteracy impose their fanaticism at any price The Minister of Justice should not have profiled she had a greater responsibility That this law was a good law was his obligation and therefore failure is fundamentally his But unfortunately there is no solution anymore even by amending the law we will not be able to go back to undoing the mischief We will no longer be able to prevent them from getting out on the streets first who knows how many sexual aggressors with the consequent suffering for their victims and with the consequent risk for women for the high degree of recidivism of these criminals And they still have the defachability to say and continue to insist that this law will protect us Ladies and gentlemen how is this law going to protect us by getting the aggressors out of jail before they do How will he protect us by reducing the penalties of the aggressors Do they not realize that what they have done with this has been to remove the gravity of these crimes that by reducing penalties they feed the social consciousness that these abject crimes are less important than they are Moreover it is not just the reviews of sentences ladies and gentlemen it is not only that the revisions that have been made and that have gone beyond the mid-centenary and I say that they have transcended because we suspect that we do not have an official count because they do not want us to know the scope of its chapter it is not only that the inventory of cuts in convictions is destined to go up because there are around four thousand prisoners of these crimes in Spain and there are hundreds of cases subject to a potential review it is not only that Madrid has four hundred and fifty cases that can be reviewed nor that at least eleven other provincial hearings have pronounced themselves in favor of applying in the reviews the most favourable criterion of convictions it is that the new convictions are also affected ladies and gentlemen it is that the courts have already begun to issue sentences relating to cases of sexual assault much lower it is that in Barcelona has been handed down a sentence for a crime consummated rape in the past six years or a sexual violation that has already been imposed a punishment of three years but that is now a punishment of three years old and that has been committed an abuse I mean if a girl says yes as she is it 's not a rape and then you get shocked when we say you 're promoting pederasty It 's just that it 's very serious ladies and gentlemen It is very serious and it is not the fault of the judges or the defence lawyers it is your fault of those who presented this law and of all those who supported it This is the harsh reality It is not an invention of this Member or of this parliamentary group it is our Criminal Code that indicates that those criminal laws that favour the defendant will have retroactive effect it is our Constitution that guarantees the irretroactivity of non-proportional or restrictive provisions of individual rights It is in the drawer that if a convicted person for the old minimum sentence can request a review of the sentence it is because if he had been tried under the current law his sentence would have been lower And it does n't matter that now we also call aggression what we used to call abuse They do n't sell it to us as an advance if in the end that means the penalties are going to be lower Let us call things by their name you have reduced the penalties of rapists That 's what they 've done Because as always you protect criminals more than your victims because it seems to you that only those who violate the law the coups the seditious the embezzlers the okupas those who illegally assault our borders and now also the rapists have human rights The only thing you have achieved with this law is that as always the offender wins and that as always it is the victims who are left unprotected So please do not say again that this law protects us because only by hardening the penalties and keeping rapists away from us and our children will they be able to protect us and that will only happen if we all stop Sánchez 's blow Thank you very much
Mrs. Montero do you believe that men can access any space reserved for women simply by stating that they feel like women I ask you this question knowing that you are not going to answer me because if you answer me you would have to lie to me you would have to lie to me because you Mrs Montero who have a ministry with a budget of 573 million euros to fight supposedly for women 's rights cannot believe that something like this is right She can't be satisfied that after so many women 's struggle throughout history all she 's achieved is that we can't even go into a bathroom or a locker room anymore You 'd have to lie to me Mrs. Montero or at least you 'd have to shut up shut up and look away like you did with Olivia the girl murdered in Gijon by her mother Six young men had an innocent creature cruelly murdered to harm his father an innocent creature victim of his mother 's vicarious violence How hard it has to be to shut up Mrs. Montero How difficult it must be to deceive yourself not to go out and denounce with pain and rage as any mother would this horrible murder of a woman of one of her own to avenge her partner by murdering her own daughter That 's hard Because going out and reporting it would be recognizing that it has been wrong it would be recognizing that violence has no gender that a woman can be just as cruel as a man You at this point you can't do it anymore you 're incapable of getting out of the mess you 've been in Not even a wretched tweet Mrs. Montero You who were coming to save us the only thing you have done has been to be unprotected undervalued and stripped of all the values that have always made us women indispensable to society What kind of defense can make women who do n't condemn the death of a girl at the hands of their mother What kind of defense can make women who defend that any man can go through being a woman What kind of defense does anyone approve that a girl 's body can be mutilated with a possible gender dysphoria without any more criteria than that of the girl herself turning a healthy person into a chronically ill person who will have to take medication for the rest of his life suffering from a risk of thrombosis heart attack or cancer What kind of defense can make women who allow a man who is not able to win a competition in male categories to compete as a woman in female categories taking away from our athletes any chance of getting a title What kind of defense that allows them to enter our energetic neighborhoods without control that assaults and rapes us because they consider us pieces of meat without rights but then legislates for those crimes to come out cheaper and cheaper Answer me if you can Mrs. Montero I beg you
Mrs. Montero I 'm only asking you to condemn here and now the murder of this child
Gentlemen of Bildu only those who have the vocation to serve Spain should sit in this House and we all know that you are not here for that You have no moral authority to defend any cause in this House because the first cause that any good politician should defend is life and you do not do so You continue to think that there are causes that justify death that your causes did justify the death of innocent people and that is why we cannot argue with you as if you were another parliamentary group It is absolutely impossible for us because we cannot forget where you come from who you are why you are here and how much innocent blood was shed so that you could get to where you are So no gentlemen of Bildu you have no moral authority to go up to this rostrum or to talk about the price of light or to talk about anything because the mere fact that you are here is a stab at the back of democracy and those who died to defend it is a stab at the back of all Spaniards But as much as this cruel injustice hurts us the reality is that you are here and that today you come to reproach with your small mouth to scold only a little bit the government you support the government that could not carry out any of your projects without you and that has not kept your promise to lower the price of light They 'll forgive me but you have to be a hypocrite Does the Lemoniz nuclear power plant sound like anything to you gentlemen of Bildu The 1970s were going on and then we did n't even know what climate change was however theirs were already used thoroughly to paralyze their construction Up to three hundred times it was attacked and on 17 March 1978 its predecessors Lords of Bildu planted a bomb that failed to paralyze that nuclear project but which took forward the lives of the first two victims of their ecological struggle which they have been colonizing since then There were two humble workers Andrés Guerra and Alberto Negro and there were fourteen others wounded A year later in 1979 they planted a second bomb that caused the death of another worker Ángel Baños but as they still did not achieve their goal on 29 January 1981 they kidnapped José María Ryan The following day they issued a communiqué in which they conditioned their release on the decision of the Spanish Government to demolish the nuclear power plant within seven days Remember gentlemen of Bildu Because thousands of people went to the streets to ask their terrorists those whom you protect and honor not to fulfill their threat but for nothing as it did not serve years later with Miguel Ángel Blanco On the night of 6 February he was shot in a jar and left his body abandoned on a forest road He was thirty eight years old and five children and he was killed only because he worked as a chief engineer in the construction of the Lemoniz nuclear power plant They did the same thing weeks later with their heroic substitute Ángel Pascual Mújica in front of their own son In total five murders It was the blood of five innocent people that served them to achieve their goal cruelly considered then as one of ETA 's great victories to which the Socialist government of Felipe González sadly contributed by approving its famous nuclear moratorium three years later in 1984 But the dismantling of the Lemoniz plant not only cost us the lives of five innocent people something that could not be paid even with all the gold in the world It also cost us EUR 6 billion to which we must add what cost us the dismantling of other power plants that were being built in those years Do n't you think that in today 's light receipt we 're not paying for the consequences of your yesterday 's decisions Well of course we 're paying them And not only that but if all the nuclear power plants that were planned had been built those whose energy is now being considered as green energy we would probably not see ourselves today as we see ourselves poor and energy dependent unable to achieve for our citizens a fair price for the light they consume You with your political selfish and murderous opportunism are directly responsible for the high price we pay for light You like the Socialist Party have since contributed to the loss of our country 's energy sovereignty which has led us to the situation that now has the defachability to denounce How can you come here to say to the Government to your Government to that Government you support that your measures have not served to end the energy poverty that you have contributed to generating You that the only thing you have brought to our country and your own land has been death and ruin Gentlemen of Bildu for us there is only one thing you can do in this House go up to this rostrum and deny what your predecessors did publicly acknowledge that this was monstrous that they would never have had to resort to crime to achieve their goals that they sincerely repent that they are hurt by every innocent victim they caused and that they will contribute to the clarification of the pending attacks and the reparation of the victims If you do not we will have no choice but to keep reminding all the Spaniards in each of our speeches what you are and where you come from because we simply cannot allow the death of so many innocent victims for all of us and for our freedom to have been in vain Thank you very much
Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the PNV criticizes the government 's management but little We know that they are very united by the bonds of mutual interest in voting and tolling If what the PNV asked was positive and would benefit the nation as a whole it would be acceptable but you always sweep for your region no matter what happens in the rest of Spain thus generating huge gaps in inequality between the Spanish You have privileges that we do not enjoy most of the Spaniards and that is that those historic rights which are very old suit you when it comes to claiming resources paid by all the Spaniards but if it comes to sharing never What is clear is that European funds must be part of Spain 's economic drive project and not of seventeen different projects that serve to calm the insatiable hunger for separatism and nationalism As the representative of Esquerra said you should have been here this morning in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs because the Socialist MEP Mrs Nasarre said that the Government supported the non-law proposal of Esquerra Republicana calling for absolute and absolutist management of the electric vehicle by the Autonomous Communities something similar to what you request when it is necessary to stress that precisely the Autonomous Communities have received from the funds disbursed by the General Administration of the State 65 a total of 11 578 million euros of which the Autonomous Communities themselves will have to inform logically Mrs Nasarre has said of this proposal by Esquerra Republicana that they agree on the substance but that with a month 's delay which is what the proposer is asking they do not give them time to legislate As you can understand let them say that in a month they do n't give them time to legislate on a GNP when in a week they want to strike the Constitution another on the Penal Code and two organic laws with a proposal for a law it 's as if they were trying to take the Spaniards hair which is insulting and embarrassing Since the last forty eight hours have seen the expression unprecedented events are taking place in our country I would like to take this opportunity to say that 50 billion unexecuted European funds do not have precedents A royal decree that has been being processed as a bill for two years with 77 extensions of time to amend has no precedent Of course you are in a hurry to manage your interest but not the interest of the Spaniards The information provided by the Government through the website on the evolution and implementation of funds provides data until June and when the minister comes here last morning is that when they update it I do n't think this has any justification or precedent either In short the purpose of the PNV initiative we believe to be short lived seeks to obtain from the Government greater budgeting for its provinces under the recovery plan being an initiative that rather than contributing does what it does to claim The funds of the recovery mechanism which should effectively be used to carry out investments in the public and private sectors to improve the productivity of the economy are not being a lever for economic growth and their impact has been virtually zero in 2021 0.7 despite the government 's announcement in loud voice that it would have an impact on GDP growth of 2.6 A clear opacity and lack of transparency in the implementation and fulfilment of the objectives not counting that the private sector is expressing its discouragement and calls for greater agility and simplification in the procedures by also having excessive bureaucracy The fate of the funds is being fundamentally public By 2022 alone EUR 12 566 million 44 of the funds will go to the public sector In fact the Ministry of Finance has launched as you know the COFFEE system a management tool for the achievement of milestones and targets defined in the recovery plan which is 18 months late Finally with regard to the electric vehicle PART we already know that the Government announced it on a drum and platter and has not had any success 877 million have been mobilized Regarding the preparation of the addendum Minister Calvino said in her last appearance on the Commission that they had taken into account the Autonomous Communities I believe that this PNV initiative can be your alibi for what you have already negotiated in dark rooms to come out later because you are the shadow behind the government in everything and for all those who overshadowed Pedro Sánchez by supporting his motion of censure From VOX we will continue working and ending to stop Sánchez 's coup against democracy state institutions and firm in the defense of the rule of law the unity of Spain and the equality of all Spaniards
"Thank you President Good morning ladies and gentlemen If I may before I go into this matter I will express something to you in a colloquial tone how does it smell like budgets How it smells like budgets I say this because we are witnessing how some parliamentary groups are already starting to withdraw and withdraw parliamentary initiatives that are contrary to the Government That 's the face of the matter but the one we'd like to know is the other the dark one the one we do n't see In exchange for what have you withdrawn your amendment to this whole unemployment law gentlemen of the PNV Because it 's a law of unemployment In exchange for about twenty amendments as the press says or in exchange for something else How much is it going to cost the rest of the Spaniards to keep their privileges and their uniqueness As you can see with the government of Pedro Sánchez in Spain minorities are governed by a handful of votes that artificially keeps them a few more months in Moncloa Nothing new with the PNV Ladies and gentlemen of the PP check it out As far as the bill before us is concerned the way we see it already starts wrong because it brings the wrong title because from its reading we infer that it is a law of unemployment that regulates unemployment and the public administrations that manage However we do not perceive measures that really aim to generate stable and quality employment with clear and concise proposals this being the priority and nuclear issue in Spain Our amendment to the entire bill which I imagine will have been read or not is presented as a denunciation of the political and philosophical spirit of a sectarian and ideological initiative that we receive in our text with arguments Its bill forms a regulatory framework aimed at an administrative architecture that manages unemployment In the face of what might be expected from an employment law that would promote the growth of quality work the text is limited to presenting insufficient active employment policies in a new framework of institutions to regulate them and which will generate more inefficiencies administrative duplication and unnecessary public spending In this scenario the perversaideology of the Government of Spain permeates the whole normative body posed in which the discrimination between the Spaniards is the protagonist of the labor model it poses The text does not handle a single measure that generates labour market growth or improvements in the protection of Spanish workers Analysis of labour market gaps and shortcomings is vague and imprecise while it does not propose solutions that provide long term answers However we already see every day how the minister applauds herself for the good that according to her the labour market is functioning thanks to her pseudo reform so by giving her a little ink and re-baptised makeup the employment contracts she presumes a stable labour market in which the indefinite contracts multiply Of course Minister you have banned temporary contracts and penalized them That is to say you encourage indefinite recruitment at a time of punishment which does not favour long term contracts but punishes temporary recruitment The stimulus therefore that you offer to indefinite recruitment is a sanction to the other hiring So logically companies are fleeing the penalty It 's a matter of survival and logic You do n't have to be too smart to come to that conclusion Minister Fear and fear of your sanctions are the only incentive you offer companies to carry out indefinite contracts This is what you do rather than promoting an enabling climate based on long term legal certainty and real incentives for stable recruitment That is this Government instead of rewarding excellence punishes disobedience to its impositions Communism manual In this sense companies as you know are bound yes or yes to those contracts called indefinite which does not mean that they will be extended over time or that they will be stable because as you know companies if they cannot bear the costs in addition to adjusting energy consumption also adjust the templates by redundancies unfortunately You know what has raised the bill of light inputs the price of materials and fuel No you do n't know you do n't know because you live in your fantasy world I 'd like to know if you know the pain it brings for any self employed or for any SME to fire a worker Maybe you have no idea why since you 've never hired a worker you do n't even know what it means to fire him We must therefore not look at the name of the contract itself but rather at the actual and actual duration of the contract in the long term I invite you to do that analysis and bring it here to the House one day at a hearing What is the actual duration of indefinite contracts on average which have been formed from their labour reform But the real indefinite ones not those fixed discontinuous ones that you speak of that already exist decades ago and that you have not invented them minister A fixed discontinuity is a temporary contract accumulated in the year nothing more You do n't stop cheating on the loner Bring us that statistics and you will check the reality of the stability of the labour market in Spain I 'll give it to you in advance In view of the impossibility as I said of making temporary contracts to meet temporary needs some companies resort to such indefinite recruitment but days before the end of the probationary period they do not have to pay compensation without the worker The number of people who do not exceed this probationary period has increased I told you two weeks ago by nine compared to last year before its reform came into effect The probationary period lasts between two and six months depending on the position and from July 2021 to July 2022 this case for termination of contracts has increased by more than 900 We will also highlight the overall increase in dismissals due to objective causes by 234.7 voluntary reductions by 258 and involuntary reductions by 320.9 You like the data and I give it to you for study So to a greater extent and as it could not be otherwise this law that we amend today goes in line with its creation of more public bodies which will generate administrative duplication and more unnecessary public spending at a time when the Spaniards do not arrive at the end of the month And of course the gender ideology that has emerged with a breakdown of the labour market in what you call collectives labeling workers for a single trait that curiously almost always coincides with sex or sexual orientation What an obsession you have with this It 's just that it 's tired and sick We say no to the introduction of gender criteria in labour legislation and not to the acritical follow up of the positions of the 2030 Agenda for the sake of a so called new society which is neither new nor society while emphasizing the differences of those who are equal in the assumption of rights responsibilities and freedoms People are people and we all have the same obligations and rights according to that status of person The same rights to have access to a job to have access to education and to have access to health regardless of our exo our beliefs and our race and it is already in our Constitution Therefore your law is clearly discriminatory because rather than ensuring equal opportunities for access to a job what you do is prioritise one another according to whether certain features or characteristics of some people you like more or less than others that is confrontational policies What you call inclusion in fact is exclusion from the sphere of your policies to a part of society Change the concept of inclusion to that of equal opportunities and it will be much better for the Spaniards With regard to the reality of unemployment that you intend to manage with this absurd law see if it will be bad the law that even the unions that you have on pay in your ministry have complained and so they have said you should focus on the data of the unemployment of people over forty five years old which you have mentioned earlier and on those of young people so that they can find a stable and quality job with a remuneration according to their decent qualification that allows the former to maintain a sufficient working life until the retirement age and our young people to work a future By the way it turns out from the law that for you young extolled mainly foreign have priority over the rest another exclusionary inclusion right Look an equique union of its own denounces that long term unemployed people continue to live a drama in our country people around one and a half million who have been seeking employment for more than a year while more than 600,000 have been living for more than four years an alarming figure For this union the solution to this social drama is to improve an insufficient employment law and that has been adopted without social dialogue through the promotion of more effective active employment policies which adapt to the specific reality of each person and achieve a rapid reintegration into work because people who have been unemployed for a long time without the possibility of obtaining a job as you know are caught in a spiral that in addition to compromising their economic survival damages their mental health and therefore diminishes their role in society and their dignity But you give it to me that I hit you with the gender which is what goes for them The bill does not focus on the equality of Spaniards and does not even intend to do so As I have just said these sectors both young and over 45 years of age deserve the priority attention of a responsible and truly committed Government to meeting the needs of those who have the most difficulty finding a job The regulation of a matter as far reaching as employment requires seriousness impartiality and a sense of State in order to be carried out under the appropriate conditions It also requires ambition illusion and will to rid ourselves of this structural unemployment that we suffer in Spain fuelled by a system that has been carried away by the ideological velocities of the left opposed to effort meritocracy hard work and material progression Values such as effort merit and innovation must set out decent employment with the aim of enabling the proper development of entrepreneurship while strengthening the protection of workers and in a corresponding way of Spanish families through the stability and quality of jobs"
I 'm on my way But there is hope and soon the Spaniards will be able to decide their future and will do so with a sense of responsibility because in Spain as in Europe it is the time of the patriots Thank you very much
"Thank you President Minister even if you do n't believe it I agree with you on one point and it is that our main task is to protect the Spaniards but now from what and from whom should we protect them And here 's the hue the loss of purchasing power Of course Precarity in employment Also But do you know who we should protect the Spaniards from primarily From this government because you are the greatest danger and the main threat to Spain to our economy to our freedoms and to our rule of law and I will justify this by referring you to facts and data Threat to our economy Spain is the only country in the European Union that has not yet reached pre-pandemic GDP levels with a public debt per capita of € 30,000 and a GDP per capita of 25,460 with inflation above 10 and an underlying of 5.5 Threat to our freedoms censorship to which you think differently political violence and two states of alarm of your fist and letter minister declared unconstitutional the greater violation of rights and freedoms to the Spaniards in democracy with the excuse of protecting them as if they were unable to assume their own responsibilities and autonomous kidnapped in their homes to which they were forbidden to work and to whom they have not yet been compensated for expropriating that right to work A threat to the rule of law they closed the Congress their occurrence also minister declared unconstitutional lock with which their government held a concentration of power proper to the dictatorships with the Attorney General of the State at their service the CIS and now the INE and Indra and they assault the institutions of the State and those who cannot attack them pretend to discredit as did their partner the Minister of Decoute and Unemployment with the governor of the Banco de España And how far do they intend to go They whiten the executioners and abandon the victims To mitigate the perverse effects of inflation they invite the Spaniards to turn off the light and not turn on the air conditioning whoever has it while Times Square girls burn fuel in the Falcon and go hiking paid with our taxes What will be the next Minister Are you going to invite the Spaniards to eat twice instead of three times a day And you 're going to do it with another state of alarm to protect them You go along the path of rationing cards because of course you invite the Spaniards to spend less a rule that does not apply to your mastodontic government which continues to waste But of course taking into account the memorable phrases of their feminist ministers one that says that public money is nobody 's and another that says small billions are nothing because with these references we understand their spending policies Advice I do n't have for myself And the royal decree that we propose to validate today together with the Royal Decree Law 6/2022 of which it is extended includes a set of measures that will imply a lower income to the public arks approximately 5825 million However tax revenues up to May have increased from the previous year by 15.5 billion which would triple the impact of these tax discounts In conclusion the Government of P. Sánchez returns only one in three euros of the revenue increase to the Spaniards and the rest is left by the Executive to continue spending without making a single cut in advisors chiringuitos and mismanagement It is the authentic and inimitable government of ruin Ladies and gentlemen a year and a half ago no means of communication or any study service announced the economic effects of Russia 's invasion of Ukraine but what we often heard then was the risk of inflation that the economies were going to face But this government obsessed with euthanasia democratic memory and focused on climate suicide forgot to protect the families from the ruinous loss of purchasing capacity that followed and which you are therefore complicit in I will read you a text that we will publish at the beginning of November 2021 A cost inflation process is taking place due to a supply shock driven by rising energy prices as well as the lack of supply of components and raw materials on international markets without the Government actively addressing it through energy and trade policy instruments in a credible and sustainable manner in the short term in the medium term This is part of the entire amendment tabled by VOX to the 2022 State General Budgets an issue on which we continue to insist as a risk factor for budgets based on an unrealistic macroeconomic picture Look you started taking steps to curb inflation in April of this year two months after the invasion of Ukraine and when you 've subsidized that 20 cents a liter of fuel it 's increased the price by at least 40 cents and when you 've touched the price of light the bill has increased Therefore we are now facing this crisis with the worst imaginable situation We have a debt of 118 of GDP an increase in interest rates and a fragile labour market based on public employment and with growth let 's say fixed or discontinuous Well that 's it Ladies and gentlemen inflation risk has been a fact since the end of 2020 That is why Germany for example dropped VAT massively to contain the rise in prices and despite suffering more virulently from the effects of the war has managed to maintain lower inflation levels than those recorded by Spain This royal decree is the palm show that when they have to face problems they do it late and killing flies to cannons It 's bread for today and hunger for tomorrow And it 's not a topic now it 's a palpable reality socialism first breaks your legs and then gives you a crutch to walk And if not ask the farmers stifled by the increase in costs with a food chain law that is another farce and that does n't work ask the transporters those right wing activists according to you and ask the gas stationers who are sick of financing their magnificent ideas such as that of me government invitation and you gas stationer you pay You are an incapacitated government to design the policies that suit the Spanish and to implement the measures that can save our economy In conclusion do not save us like this Minister You 're on your way out and the sooner the better Thank you very much"
Thank you President Minister I offer you figures and no data lest you tell me that the data is sexist and even if you do n't like it it 's not violence According to a recently published survey after its failure 60 of respondents six out of ten believe that their law far from strengthening women 's protection and punishing aggressors properly is precisely causing the opposite effect so they feel that it should resign as the main driving force behind the law Catalan feminist associations unsuspecting of sexists reproach him for his lack of listening sensitivity and the lack of contact he has had with these associations qualified as an electoralist contradictory and false Montero law In the demonstration of November 25 convened by the Feminist Movement of Madrid a little macho too it was heard IreneMontero resignation in the presence of several ministers his companions Three associations of judges have requested their resignation for insulting judges in the face of such a reduction of sentences from sexual aggressors in application of their harsh law And finally the Federal Police Union has also requested his resignation for the last campaign of his ministry a video in which a woman is killed by her ex-partner and it is said that the killer is a retired national police officer who kills with his regulatory weapon In addition sexual assaults in Spain continue to grow 3196 convicted of sexual offences in 2021 35 more than in 2020 and 16 more than in 2019 14 offenders released from prison more than 50 reductions in convictions for sex offenders resulting from the application of their law Faced with this panorama tell me Will you end the legislature by being a minister
Thank you President Minister you do n't serve your intentions The policies I have already told you are measured by the results and as you see most Spaniards of all conditions are outraged and very concerned about your negligent management at the head of the Ministry of Equality which costs us more than 500 million euros a year of our taxes so that you end up telling anyone who disagrees with your insanities that fosters the culture of rape when your law is the one that puts rapists on the street This should give you at least shame And if you have a little dignity left yes or yes resign
Thank you President Minister ladies and gentlemen What you have said here Minister tells it because you have it written because it is dictated by the script of sanchism What I 'm going to tell you has not been told by anyone to tell me it is told by common sense and my professional experience as an autonomous The essence of the royal decree that today brings to validation lies in three pillars that are the principles of this Government 's policies the lie the increase in collection and the attack on freedom Many of those who pass after me through this rostrum will show their complacency with the new system of quotation for the self employed and will speak of their goodness as if it were that balm of Fierabrás to which the ingenious hidelgo of La Mancha always referred and almost all of them will have something in common that they have neither been nor are nor will ever be self sufficient a very revealing fact As I said this royal decree revolves around three axes One the lie The Government says that the self employed regime is deficient because in the use of their freedom almost all self employed people have chosen the minimum contribution base Have you not thought that the choice of that minimum basis of assessment may be due to the fact that it is indeed a system that has many weaknesses that you are not able to offer the self employed the consolidated rights until the time of how much you are going to charge but what you have to pay I mean the certainty is given today which I 'm going to pay but not how much I 'm going to collect from pension And among other issues the various governments so far have vetoed the possibility that many self employed people could contribute on higher bases when they requested it because they were close to retirement age and little less that they have been told that they had fraudulent behaviour If a person is about fifty years old he is considering retirement and at that time he has more resources more availability less family burdens it is logical that he thinks of his retirement at that time and not when he is twenty years old but you accuse him of being fraudulent behaviors It is therefore a lie that the social security system for the self employed is deficient as a result of the choice of a minimum basis because we are also faced with a contributory system depending on what I bring I will charge So where 's the deficit As for the increase in collection I will tell you that you fall into your own trap If they say that the system is deficient because the majority of the self employed 84 are contributing to the minimum base it turns out that it will now cease to be deficient Why Because they 're going to collect more And I 'm going to give you two examples So far all those with incomes below the inter professional minimum wage in principle had no obligation to discharge the social security self employed regime and justice has been repeatedly endorsed in its jurisprudence From now on a self employed person with incomes below the minimum inter-professional wage will have to contribute approximately 30 of his disposable income Secondly what they have also done has been to increase the contribution for self employed entrepreneurs from EUR 60 to 80 And I 'll give you another piece of information At this time and under this scheme which you have just implemented retired people who are compatible with their pension and the development of an economic activity will also have to discharge the social security self employed regime with a number of payments a matter which has not been the case so far because you are obviating whether it is a regular activity an activity which is only residual and whether or not the income exceeds the interprofessional minimum wage As far as freedom is concerned I say to him that in fact it is an attack on freedom no matter how much boonist marketing the government intends to deceive and convince the self employed under that slogan of We do it for your sake The reality is that this is one of the nuclear issues of this decree that attack on the freedom of the self governing by suppressing your right to choose because you progressives ists -ists are very rights to choose on ethical and moral issues but when it comes to the right to choose on economic issues are more of the burgeoning right that is we all have to obey the Government are more of the imposition And under the pretext of protecting the self employed we find a social communist government that has always lived from the public which gives lessons to the self employed on how to plan their future Because of course the self employed despite having set up a business and making a living with their efforts have no idea how to plan their retirement Therefore they attack one of the few spaces where responsibility and individual freedom for the self employed could still be exercised which was to choose where and how to save or invest and design their retirement Because you always show hostility towards any behavior within society that involves exercising personal and individual freedom Its aim is to inculcate citizens who either in the fold or who alone will be unable to live by their own means From VOX we know that the self employed instead of imposing need transparent and reliable information certainty and legal certainty Minister if as I have said before you are not able to offer citizens the amount of consolidated social security contributions rights do you think you will be able to organise the future and pensions for the self employed Finally as regards the protective action that you have spoken about by Social Security we agree that we must protect the self employed yes but we must protect them from you from this government that has ruined thousands of them I remind you that they forced thousands of them to close their businesses through a state of unconstitutional alarm declared unconstitutional thanks to VOX 's resources They were illegally denied their right to work and have not yet been compensated as they deserve and as we have defended since VOX They behaved with them as an entrepreneur who sent a worker home without compensation Can you imagine Minister that thinking of the general interest of the Spaniards we send you and your entire government home without the right to compensation Being the goal pursued by the general interest and to save lives it would be justified for us to skip the Constitution and put you on the street That is the protection you have given the autonomous As regards the protection system there is a possibility that the self employed person will receive the cessation benefit which is when he or she has debts exceeding 150 of his or her income Do you know what you 've done Excluding from those debts that have been incurred with Finance and Social Security when many self employed today still carry debts with Social Security and Finance from the pandemic which they could not pay because they did not generate income because you forced them to close In order to complete the menu of misconceptions posed by the Government and those who dance to it water you have modified article 117 of the General Tax Law I say this to hear me from the Minister of Finance who is here and you have modified that article on the pretext that Social Security can obtain better information from the Tax Agency regarding the determination of the bases but that is a lie it is not true In the explanatory statement of the royal decree you say that they do so in relation to the special tax system of allocation of income and in the final wording of the article they have omitted the allocation of income and have left special tax regimes so that now the tax management bodies which so far could not will be able to check special tax regimes when that space was reserved for the Inspection which always gives greater and better guarantees to the taxpayer And it is that on 29 March 2021 the Supreme Court handed down a judgment which referred to abuses committed by tax management bodies that initiated proceedings on special tax regimes for which they were not entitled So by the back door we 've already amended the General Tax Law and it's all fixed All right Of course let us stress the absence of the law of transparency as to what will be the actual computable income or returns for the purpose of determining the base of contribution because what is felt after a careful reading of the text is that the self employed must contribute not for the returns of their economic activity but for all And I ask you Minister even for the supposed returns Because of course you talk about derivatives of holding participation in an entity with or without legal personality What does this mean That if a self employed person has a mechanical workshop with his brother in law for the value of the social participation he has in that entity will you impute an assumed income to him Because it is not clear in the royal decree law Are they secretly introducing a tax on the capital disguised as the highest social security contribution Careful Another pildorita When the Tax Agency initiates a verification procedure and determines that the returns declared by an autonomous person are lower than it considers this liquidation will logically refer it to Social Security so that Social Security also conforms to a new contribution base and all these do so by obviating the right of the taxpayer to seek such liquidation The self employed will therefore now have to pay the tax quota resulting from the liquidation of the Treasury and the quota resulting from the liquidation of the Social Security despite its appeal and then the courts give it the reason that is more payments And here we enter into dangerous ground on the subject of the Tax Agency because you know and if you do n't know it I tell you from my experience that tax legislation has many ambiguities and this from will be deductible those expenses necessary for the development of the activity You for example when you are going to play golf because you play golf do you see the clothing you bring today No right Another different one That is that the suit you wear could be considered as a necessary expenditure for the development of your activity as can happen to an autonomous a mason a commercial when they buy your work uniform Well that 's what you say to tax management and it sounds like Chinese I 've seen mobile phone bills fulminate to an autonomous because they picked up phone calls on Sunday Look at the level Nothing has to do with the computable performance for tax purposes of an activity with economic performance and therefore the problem for the self employed is you There is life beyond the public pension and Dad State I tell you that every article every provision every section of this rule is a deadly trap for the entrepreneur the hunt for the self employed the free citizen and the diver has begun Take care of yourselves but resist And as one singer said They played in time the lie and the truth they competed in time and the lie runs more but at the moment the truth came to the end
Thank you President Good morning ladies and gentlemen This amendment to the bill on tax popularly referred to as municipal surplus value causes as you know in Royal Decree 26/2021 the royal decree of the haste the one that arranged the minister in one weekend not to stop the cash register clinc clinc I would like to clarify in case some people do not know that they are seeing us from their homes that this tax already set it in its penultimate version by the People 's Party back in 2002 Yes Mr Montoro this one has a lot to do with Montero so in addition to having almost the same surname when they raise taxes they pass it as they say in my land better than a hare in a vineyard The PSOE then continues the saga keeping this tax in its terms first with Zapatero then with Sánchez and finally the Constitutional Court putting some sanity extinguished it But the culebrón does not end here because the PSOE reinvents the tax two months ago and now the People 's Party with its amendment to the whole is going to make up the reinvention of the sanchoist regime with some slight exemption from a joke but the question is that it keeps the tax in force On the contrary the VOX Parliamentary Group which announced on 2 December the full challenge of this rule enacted to reinstate a new surplus value tax challenged it for two reasons First because the legislative figure used by the minister the royal decree- law and his haste deceivingly disguised as urgent necessity was not the right one that is what did not solve in two years arranged it on a weekend And second for the content of the rule which reinvents a new formula for the sole purpose of continuing to attack unjustifiably the pocket of the Spaniards This challenge that I announced to you today is materialized in two actions An action in the legislative plane bringing to this House an amendment to the whole of the above mentioned rule that we are dealing with today as a draft law and in which we propose an alternative text worked reflected and impregnated with common sense and sense of state and which reflects the definitive expulsion of our legal order from this unconstitutional confiscational and unjustified imposed A second action very important and which I thank publicly to the magnificent legal team of VOX led by our secretary general Mrs Olona in the judicial field by the lodging of an unconstitutionality appeal to this infamous royal decree- law which was pergenuated one afternoon on a weekend after a congress by the largest collector of the kingdom to the braves and their way The amendment to the whole of which the VOX Group is bringing to the debate proposes the amendment of Article 59 of the consolidated version of the Local Finance Act and the deletion of Articles 104 to 110 and consequently the definitive elimination of this tax Since all the initiatives that we have put forward since VOX enjoy rigour and justification this amendment could not be less and the origin of it is not based on an ideological whim or on very chulian ideas but rather brings its cause in the common sense and in our objective which is nothing but to improve the lives of the Spaniards Having said that the various rulings of the Constitutional Court which I will not repeat have come to reveal the profound collision of this tax figure with the principle of constitutionality
As I say these rulings of the Constitutional Court have come to reveal the profound collision of this tax figure with the constitutional principle of economic capacity a principle which has been raised above the collecting anxiety of any government of the Government of Sánchez and also of other previous governments which did not blush to shape this tax see Mr Montoro although today its successors who call themselves opposition tear their clothes and amend themselves Consequently it was entirely necessary to accompany the legal system to such unconstitutionality judgments imposed on the tax in question in the last four years Thus the rule that we come to amend today in subtotality apparently deals with this matter but we believe that it is not enough to adapt the tax to the constitutional jurisprudence that has fallen since 2017 but that it is necessary to proceed to its immediate abolition One of the fundamental reasons for this is that this tax is double taxation with other figures in our tax system since they all charge the same amount of income or wealth and therefore we are faced with a clearly confiscatory tax figure For this reason and in order to be respectful first with the efforts of the Spaniards to contribute to the maintenance of public expenditure and secondly with the constitutional principles of economic capacity and non-confessorship of our tax system it is appropriate to definitively expel the tax from our legal system The double taxation to which we refer is apparent when we are faced with a tax which imposes an increase in the value of land of an urban nature a tax similar to that on which for example taxes on the income of individuals or corporation tax taxes which are also applicable to property gains or increases understood as increases in value In summary for example we could say that there is double taxation between surplus value and the IRPF in onerous and lucrative transmissions between individuals between surplus value and corporation tax in onerous transmissions between legal persons and with inheritance and donation tax We also find cases of double taxation between surplus value and some special contributions required by the municipalities for the realization of public works or services All of this is coupled with the fact that the legal configuration of the tax has not even come to consider the actual economic capacity of the taxpayer but rather a non-existent or fictitious one On the other hand the collecting power of this tribute which seems to make it indispensable or irreplaceable for the necessary financing of local corporations is not a sufficient reason to justify its existence but the reasonable approach would be the opportunity for a reform of the financing system of the municipalities adapting financial needs to the competences and therefore to the services they provide However neither the different governments of Spain nor the municipalities themselves have shown sufficient interest in promoting a reform in this regard since 2017 but have preferred to rely on a relevant part of their collection to a merely powerful tribute and discussed foundations to the point of continuing its validity four years after the first ruling of the Constitutional Court which laid down the very existence and legal configuration of the tribute Since 2017 the different governments in appearance of a different political colour have chosen to sacrifice the pocket of the Spaniards rather than to legislate to reduce their fiscal effort As for the parallel action that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech we are talking about the filing of an appeal of unconstitutionality by our parliamentary group which is based on the fact that a new tax cannot be created through the figure of the royal decree- law however much the government of the regime claims an urgent treacherous and treacherous need But the most indecent and immoral thing in a boast of contempt for the pocket and the intelligence of the Spaniards was to hear from the Minister of Finance herself that this was arranged by her on that famous weekend Therefore with the filing of this appeal by VOX we again keep our word to give the battle against the unjust rules of the sanchist regime on all fronts including the judicial one And since we already know that you are quite predictable unoriginal and very repetitive in your balance and corner narrative the Socialist Group which supports the government and protects the minister will go up to the rostrum as well as to talk about hatred xenophobia far right sanitary cordon and other disqualifying adjectives but for each of those disqualifying adjectives that verbalize we put on a pin a medal a bracelet or smoke a pure according to the day because it does not offend anyone who wants but who can I am going to go ahead with your report and say that we have worked intensively on this amendment in an integral way not only to propose the abolition of the tax but also by calculating the possible budget deficit which the municipalities will suffer by eliminating this tax from the tax inferno that we suffer in Spain In addition we have come to propose the source for funding The economic impact of this tax on the municipalities has been estimated at approximately EUR 25 billion per year taking into account the historical collection process This meagre amount of resources can be compensated without the Spanish having to face a new embezzlement eliminating certain unnecessary and superfluous toxic costs which are already found in the approved General State Budgets and which do not provide any utility or service to the Spaniards In this way these EUR 25 billion that the State would no longer spend on frivolities could be used to finance the municipalities without the Spanish seeing the public services that they need being undermined There are many tolls that this Government must pay among other things to certain coalition partners in order to remain artificially in power and therefore these excesses must not be borne or financed free of charge by the Spanish in exchange for anything they must be eliminated by democratic hygiene and so we get two by one As we reduce the fiscal strength of the Spaniards we are embarking on a true ecological transition not the one you preach but the real one eliminating toxic and harmful waste that will improve the health of state institutions and oxygenate our democracy Thus we eliminate for example within the high ranking staff and high burdens some possible fingered and others in current expenses and services the regime 's propaganda for example or the regime 's agenda is called 2030 within the Ministry of the Interior subsidies to political parties the ministry of inequality what you call inclusion which is really excluded from the Spanish in the Ministry of Labour mariscatos and the like the ministry as a whole of the anticonsumption of Spanish products the Ministry of Universities which has no functions and some details of presidency and democratic demoralism All this which I have here perfectly detailed if you want then I pass it amounts to the amount of 2587 million euros Squared the accounts with the current approved budgets we do not raise the budget of expenses we offer to the municipalities a total certainty in their resources without needing to raise the taxes to anyone will not produce the unwanted effect of increase in the price of the buildings which is another of the pernicious sequels that generates this tribute and so we are dismantling chiringuitos and eliminating a lot of expenditure whose marginal utility is negative for Spain and the Spaniards Thank you very much
"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the policies implemented by a ministry and managed by your minister must be measured not by their propaganda their intentions their ideology but by their results Therefore in view of the repeated actions of Mrs Irene Montero which harm the common good her demonstrated incompetence her persistent advocacy of sexual activity by and among minors her incisive attacks on the separation of powers and the rule of law and her neglect of the lack of protection of women which implies the legislation promoted by the Ministry of Equality which benefits offenders the VOX Parliamentary Group proposes before this House the reprobation of the Minister of Equality and urges the President of the Government to cease it and abolish the unnecessary unjust Ministry of Equality which implements policies contrary to article 14 of the Constitution and costly in its structure and to allocate the entire budget to alleviate the social emergency suffered by the Spaniards This initiative is based precisely on the damage that the minister from her position and the useless department she runs is inflicting on the interests of the Spaniards a department that with the excuse of promoting false equality does precisely promote the pre-eminence of women at the cost of the male and the confrontation between them to grant more rights to one part of society at the expense of curtailing the rights of the other half All the laws of this ministry and its minister framed in a sinister ideology violate fundamental rights being the most attacked precisely that of equality before the law and that of the presumption of innocence of the man a degenerate ideology that prejudges all men by pointing them as guilty However when the courts issue sentences and imprison rapists corrupt or seditious the left uses harsh laws that facilitate the liberation of those same rapists or directly pardon the same corrupt or seditious convicted with firm sentences a total and absolute lack of respect for justice A minister who insults judges and a president of the government who intends to submit to the judiciary a clear exponent of totalitarianism Will the minister think that judges like to release sex offenders A Ministry that promotes policies to confront radical feminism abandons the real victims makes invisible the violence committed by women against their children or the psychological abuse suffered by heterosexual Uhmosexual men as well as by lesbian women and defends a multiculturalism that translates precisely into an incomprehensible tolerance towards cultures that do not respect women 's rights Since Mrs. Montero is minister according to official records more than 150 victims of domestic violence have been killed including minors at the hands of their mothers or parents a disastrous result that results in loss of human lives and sometimes deaths in life Victims of sexual offences many of them by imported herds between 2020 and 2021 have been more than 30,000 and since the entry into force in October their law of yes or yes more than half a hundred convicted sexual aggressors have benefited from the reduction of penalties and fourteen of them have been released Also the 3200 convictions handed down in 2021 for sexual offences plus those of previous years may be appealed to the courts a very serious issue for the judicial system and indignant for the victims because pre-law convictions as you know can be reviewed and reduced due to the general principle of retroactivity of the most favourable sanctions as set out in article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution and article 2.2 of the Criminal Code and judges subject to the rule of law will not fail to apply these basic principles because it would mean a retrogression in the field of human rights And it is that in order to comply with the Constitution gentlemen of the left first of all we must read it and also know how to interpret it Let 's see if it will turn out that the Spanish Constitution is also macho like the judges according to the minister the minister who wanted to put on a medal with this law as her main asset regardless of the plethora of reports that advise her that she sent them with It is that they are machoists Because for the minister everything that is not to her pleasure that contradicts her or that bothers her is machoism or violence an extremely dangerous argument Socialist gentlemen in June 2017 you reproached the Minister of Finance Montoro in this House for letting tax criminals go free Do n't you think it 's more serious than this law that you 're letting sex offenders go free Nor did the minister hear technical advice at the 8 M demonstration days before the pandemic was declared even knowing the effects the expansion and the risk of COVID which caused more than fifty thousand deaths that you did not tell us because you to some dead dig them up but to others hide them Another aberrant manifestation that we have heard from the minister 's mouth making almost apologia of pederasty is this of abro quotes All children and children of this country have the right suspensive points to acknowledge that they can love or have sexual relations with whom they please based that is on consent closure quotes They have also forbidden people to pray on the street and intend to grant more rights to animals than to people But look paraphrased Podemos who said in his day 'we must politicize pain that pain becomes proposals to change reality for let us make it and change reality that all that pain that the Ministry of Equality with its minister at the front is causing victims of sexual aggression to innocent men appointed or to indoctrinate children and deprived of their parents serves to approve this motion and that the minister ceases in her functions and that her ministry is indeed a reference to the centre This reprobation is therefore necessary because of the extraordinary gravity of the events reported and the dramatic results of their policies for Spanish society and above all for women I 'm on my way This is what Irene Montero an executive arm of Sánchez 's policies is doing with Spanish taxes more than 500 million a year There is no better service to Spain and democracy than to present this complaint in this Congress of Deputies so that today also the parliamentary groups that passed this law that does or does benefit criminals and that their voters who surely defend women see what the deputies vote for"
if you vote with discretion I conclude Madam President or by more appreciating party discipline than to the victims It is another proposal that will help to curb Sánchez 's coup Thank you
Thank you President From Spanish to Spanish from politics to politics from women to women and above all from mother to mother the barbarities that he poured out last week in parliamentary office and that millions of families were able to hear are not susceptible to interpretation because in a literal and unequivocal way they incited the corruption of minors yes starting a way to normalize sexual practices of adults with children a full fledged advocacy of paedophilia equipping pathologies to normal behaviors and whose direct consequence is the most absolute lack of protection of minors and children from sexual predators Because of the seriousness of your words will you resign
After his statements we now understand that since Podemos systematically sees the investigation of recent sexual scandals with minors for from his words we extract that these aberrations do not in essence see them as a crime but accept them as something normal His social engineering based on a perverse ideology seeks to confuse the innocent presenting the darkest desires of the radical left as rights You victimize people on the pretext of protecting them but then abandon them in a society that dehumanizes the individual and humanizes the animal We hear the words of a minister who has lost the north and the papers who turns her personal problems into state issues and who legislates for trauma His ministry is the biggest attack on the equality of Spaniards the embodiment of discrimination and its policies against confrontation It is 525 million euros useless except for you your little friends friends and friends while thousands of Spanish families do not arrive at the end of the month Since VOX we have called for your reprimand and your cessation and we have complained against you for inciting a crime of child corruption Children are not mature enough to make certain decisions so they are children and their parents and the public authorities subsidiaryly are responsible for ensuring their protection and not for their corruption
Thank you President Madam Vice President you 're going on a tour of Hispano America with the narco communist group in Puebla to campaign as the leader of your Sumar platform and we do n't know who 's paying for it Once there I intended to make technical stop in support of a criminal Mrs Kirchner convicted of corruption but of course who supports corrupt people does not miss us because in Spain they also do although they are pardoned here directly It aims to expropriate the savings to the owners who have more than five houses in the purest Chávez style and that in turn these owners can only charge rents of old rent like those of old With what law will they expropriate the houses with that of 1954 which still have in force They do n't repeal it even though it 's anachronistic and older than the black thread He abandons the officials of the Labour Inspectorate suffocating himself every day with more tasks without seeking the right human means and these warn him that they will go on strike the first in the history of Spain of this body There 's no precedent for that He proposed raising taxes to supermarkets which he applauded during the pandemic forcing them to offer affordable shopping baskets and if he did not do so he would ban them from having their profits It betrays the Spanish entrepreneurs by introducing a Bildu amendment to the Employment Act Bildu adalid of peaceful negotiation by granting without legal basis the functions of revision of the ERE to the Labour Inspectorate which as I have already said it abandons condemning to work more for less After analyzing all this are you acting in the service of the general interest
For I believe that you are rather acting in the service of your own interest and your ideological agenda apart from the interest of the Spaniards of all conditions I do n't have friends who have more than five homes but I do n't have friends who enjoy a 450 square metre house like you where the Spaniards pay you their expenses with our taxes and you avoid the obligation to report how much they cost you So Mrs. Díaz who would want in Spain to have five medium sized dwellings that could be expropriated by being able to enjoy one of 450 meters free of charge like you
Thank you President Madam First Vice President your economic forecasts seem more like those of a pythonise than those of an economic minister because you are not even close to reality Its general budgets predicted GDP growth by 2021 above 7 which would reach almost 10 with the implementation of European funds The reality has been a GDP growth of 5 that is half of what it announced and a null and void execution of European funds that have not reached the real economy Well yes some digitizing agents have arrived The results of your economic policy for which you are responsible have generated the biggest fall in GDP in all the countries of the European Union almost 11 a debt of 120 on GDP an inflation that points to 10 the largest in thirty seven years and all this with the only recipe you know how to apply to raise taxes to create ministries and to spend without tin In the face of a slowdown in the economic recovery which you augured as robust and which is staggering in this you have not been right either Spain faces the risk of an inflation aggravated by Russia 's invasion of Ukraine And I ask you in the face of this panorama do you believe that the Spaniards trust the economic policy of their government
His answer is always the same to hide behind the insufficient and late measures for thousands of Spaniards who will have to continue to choose between buying milk or turning on the heating You together with your companions form the quintet of economic death for Spain the minister of energy ruin lady unemployment do ña toajes tax woman and you miss inflation The ministers of the digital age digital put by Sánchez 's finger are not able to respond to the real needs of the Spaniards because their policies do not serve the general interest of Spain It is you who use the Spaniards to satisfy the needs of their insatiable government needs that are many and expensive financing a thousand advisors from the president the list of the purchase of lady unemployed or more than 20 billion for equality You insult rather than listen to the legitimate demands of the Spaniards truckers farmers farmers who claim to exist and survive The street that you have n't walked in years is talking and the rejection of the Spanish towards their government is a reality that has a name democracy and freedom of expression Its only truth is the lie Sánchez 's corporate principle which governs in an excuse to justify his inability to face the challenges and threats we face And it is that you govern Spain that is great
"Thank you President Madam Minister 61 of Spaniards earn less than EUR 21,000 and because of this hidden tax which is inflation they are now 10,5 poorer than last year but their collection anxiety forces them to tax on IRPF without taking this into account so in real terms they pay more taxes Why does the Government refuse a tax reduction that protects families"
Look since 2019 that you govern in Spain the risk of poverty has increased in addition to the bill of light that today affects 13 million people 13 million Spaniards The deficit the public debt the interest rates inflation and of course the taxes that you have raised to twenty five times between the new tax figures and the previous ones Until June 2022 EUR 107 billion was raised 17 more than in the first half of 2021 You who like to put names to others would be the minister I go up to The only thing they have lowered has been the VAT of gas and electricity and they are late We VOX already proposed it in April and all of you voted against it these gentlemen also with the excuse that Brussels prevented it And do you know why they 're lowering VAT now in October To bring about a fall in the CPI in November and thus slow down the revaluation of pensions Therefore with more collection we have more poor in Spain because the collected you do not distribute it in the Robin Hood style but rather in the feudal lord style reserving to finance their causes their chiringuitos and their ministerial excesses distributing crumbs to the Spaniards Look the international organizations that you applaud when you propose to raise taxes today are unaware of them because they advise as a recipe to contain inflation to reduce public spending and you are the only ones that reduce ties in the Council of Ministers while imposing an energy rationing on the Spanish or proposing to raise food prices to ruin also the small traders These are the most enthusiastic ideas of her partner the minister of quota and unemployment offers Yolanda 2x1 two opinions one government Minister get off the Olympus on the street and stop ruling against the Spaniards
"Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen When we discuss taxes this government usually looks towards Europe with the excuse that in Spain the tax burden is lower than in the European Union and its preferred word appears harmonisation a term that the government administers at its convenience Harmonize to raise the tax bill to the Spaniards the perfect excuse to raise taxes And at the same time harmonize the criminal rates to reduce the sentences of the present and future to the seditious I ask you ladies and gentlemen of the Government why are you not so bold to harmonize for example the unemployment rates in Spain of 12.7 with those in Germany which are at 3 or with the European average of 6 Why do they not harmonise the gross domestic product per capita of each Spanish which is currently EUR 25 500 with the European average or that of Germany which is EUR 43 290 For I tell you for this they have neither haste nor audacity because they do not know how to do it and the worst is that they do not care The controversial left resorts to the European measuring rod to report that in Spain the fiscal pressure is lower an indicator that does allow us to compare with other countries but in a simplistic way since it does not measure how many taxes we pay citizens or which citizens pay them but how much the state collects So if we want to have a true picture of the effort made by businesses and families we should look at the tax sacrifice that takes per capita income into account I give you an example imagine a gentleman who earns 100,000 euros and another gentleman who earns 10,000 euros and that both are subject to the same fiscal pressure 40 Although proportionally they pay the same who makes the greatest effort Of course the one with the lowest income the one with 10 000 For that is the case in Spain in relation to other countries of the European Union that have a higher income than we do and precisely this view government wants to equate our fiscal pressure with that of them with us having a lower income Therefore we Spaniards would always make a greater sacrifice and tax effort Since Pedro Sánchez settled in Moncloa lying to his constituents and to the rest of the nation he has devoted every minute of the legislature to governing against the interests of Spain and therefore against the Spaniards allied with nationalists and separatists and with lords who used to charge a revolutionary tax for the sole purpose of shielding sanchismo in power at the high price of leaving the nation and its citizens unprotected with a continuous assault on the institutions and the liquidation of the separation of powers Within these budgets of populism ruin surrendered to coup the taxes are their cornerstone and source from which the Government drinks to spend without ten a source that the Minister of Finance considers inexhaustible as well as his collection anxiety located in historical maxims due to two factors or rather to two invoices One the one passed by the Government with up to fifty four tax increases in what we have in the legislature and two inflation a punishment for family savings and a price increase that has contributed to increasing the tax bill of taxpayers without the need to raise taxes in the State Official Gazette The policies pursued by a government are measured by their results and not by their intentions as the professor and professor Mr Manso who is now a member of VOX said And it is that separatism sanchism articulates its discourse by dividing the roles of society between good and bad Yes a government that advertises itself as a defender of the weak and confronts the wicked who are the rich and powerful Do you know anyone in Spain who concentrates more power than Sanchez It controls the Executive twisting the Legislature and wants to do it with the Judiciary Therefore if powerful is synonymous with bad he would be the most evil in terms of superlative degree But let us evaluate the facts and not the promises and what have been the results of the sanchist policies How are the Spaniards today better or worse than before Sanchez arrived in the Moncloa The government that said by mouth to supply that it would not raise taxes to the middle classes and to the workers the only thing that has lowered are the penalties and punishments to the coup and the rapists the per capita income of the Spaniards less today than in 2018 the gross domestic product which does not exceed the figure of 2019 the purchasing capacity of the Spaniards the quality of education with the general approved and the expectations of the future for young people and families condemning them to subsidy and despair On the other hand what has been increased with the government of Pedro Sánchez Inequality among Spaniards lack of protection for women and insecurity on the streets the risk of poverty which already affects more than 13 million Spaniards public debt above EUR 1 billion structural deficit close to 4 energy bill social contributions and fiscal pressure from 35 to 39 This is the summary of the communist social cuts to the prosperity of the Spanish a greater fiscal pressure and collection record whose achievements have been to increase the gap of inequality and greater poverty for Spanish society as a whole But not satisfied and in order to further deepen this inequality injustice and setback to approve these budgets have vetoed all the amendments tabled by the parliamentary groups proposing to reduce taxes admitting four nationalist amendments of the PNV which sweep home that is a classic of course to which the compromise amendment with Squerra Republicana adds which says you can try to give another coup d'état in Catalonia that we are on sale Finally and not least the Spanish must be aware of the need for politicians to demand greater efficiency in public spending because after all that money comes from their pocket with greater control and transparency but what to expect from a government of glorious phrases such as that public money is nobody's The left seeks an economy and a society that is sad exhausted surrendered to the public authorities and to the generalized subsidy Of course getting this costs money and you have to finance it and what better way to do it than by raising taxes to the right and wrong The classic recipe of socialism they sell progress and remain anchored in the 19th century Thank you very much"
Thank you President Minister your labor reform reminds me of those imported parties that are far from our traditions You know why Because it 's brought over three million undefined ghost contracts Six out of ten indefinite contracts do not generate stable employment and one out of three are fixed discontinuous According to his data his Government 's until September 2022 the membership of workers with indefinite contracts amounted to just over two million workers but for that reason 5.2 million contracts had to be signed so more than three million contracts had disappeared and had disappeared without creating stable employment Therefore a cosmetic labor reform in terms of temporality and unable to conceal reality since the average duration of indefinite contracts has collapsed by 20 and is already down by 50 days But you are not satisfied with this you are lighting up an absurd and discriminatory new plan dosing off redundancies with a gender perspective This will apply to us I imagine with the same mastery as the ERTE but you are instead of helping you Mr Escriva precisely asking for help from the Minister of Equality who has not yet condemned the murder of a girl from Olivia allegedly at the hands of her mother Therefore tell us how many genres you envisage for these novel redundancies
You as always in the absurd genre without answering what you asked Well look if in Spain we have unemployment rates that double those of the European Union for example being higher in women and over forty five years old it turns out that their most enthusiastic idea would have a negative effect for companies to hire these people women for example because they will find it more expensive to fire them It is exactly the same plan that you have devised for people with disabilities who have eliminated or plan to eliminate incentives for their recruitment thus creating barriers to their entry into the labour market Do you understand this or do I explain it to you in Latin how is Augusta Emérita 's recent arrival Therefore with these discriminatory proposals we already see how you understand equality violating fundamental rights which is the guiding principle of your Government 's policies Madam Minister you instead of adding up reduce employment opportunities and instead of a public office have become a very heavy burden on the pocket of the Spaniards
Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The debate on this law on the creation and growth of businesses has already been held in the Committee on Economic Affairs as some of the Members who have spoken before me have said and subsequently in this plenary and today we theoretically resume the debate to discuss those amendments that would modify the text that came to the Senate But I would like to point out certain issues that I think you should listen to because I would dare to say that the majority of those who occupy these seats which are now empty have not risked their heritage or faced the creepy and ruthless bureaucratic jungle that our SMEs and our self employed on the other side of these walls and that in many cases instead of being applauded and admired by taking the place they deserve in our society they are criticized demonised or accused of tax evaders of being exploiters and even criminals I speak to you from the experience that I treasure with almost thirty years of working life as an autonomous who knows and has suffered in his own flesh and shared in others which apisonator and insurmountable wall has become the Administration and bureaucracy for those who intend to create and grow a business or professional project that generates economic activity wealth and employment and without dying in the attempt It would be ideal for those who draft these voluminous bills to regulate the activity of others to experience first person experience thus knowing the difficulties involved in initiating a vital project with own ideas and scarce resources Of course it will always be up to you to show the party 's card and put yourself on some board of directors of those companies to which by the way with a lot of hypocrisy and makeup today you want to subject new taxes by making the masses believe that with this collection they will solve the lives of the 13 million Spaniards who are at risk of poverty today And they can't be more wrong because all this is the result of their ignorance their populism and their nightly idea that companies are an inexhaustible source that they can express without any negative consequences for their workers in the first place and for society as a whole A couple of weeks ago I was told by a friend who is a farmer who has a small holding Inés if the entrepreneurs in this field in this case the primary sector of the countryside we throw out the towel and get tired of crashing against the Administration labor tax local or autonomous then who is going to generate the jobs Who 's gonna do the job And I answered him Do n't worry we will always have a ministry an observatory or a state agency to put us in But then I thought Oh no We 're from VOX we do n't have the license we have it hard This is the reality As much as a bill is being brought to this House to market and sell a political product the problem of discouragement despair and exhaustion in Spain is not being solved A few months ago we could bring to this House that populist claim of a tax on the great fortunes which directly attacked the heart and financial muscle of those companies that after years of effort and work had managed to reach levels of employment generation assets and turnover that could turn them into competitive within and outside our borders But the problem with dolomies is that as they yielded benefits they should remain in the hands of Yolanda or Mary Jesus who have never risked a euro so that from the Olympus they will administer and distribute to the people as gifts the efforts of others We agree that we must all contribute to the maintenance of public expenditure with our taxes of course we do but when the balance is not compensated and public expenditure becomes unbearable the system collapses Why in Spain do we have a complete atomized business fabric in which micro-enterprises abound Do you think this is random Or does it have to do with the legislator having intervened the economy for decades voraciously without leaving room for those companies to grow Why do n't many entrepreneurs make it up to them to grow up Out of disdain Or is it rather because administrative barriers are such that they become insurmountable walls They are little David against Goliath the businessman against the Administration who far from helping him encouraging him encouraging him persecuting him harassing him and eventually exhausting himself We are faced with a law with much philosophy and little solution which reformulates the law of market unity which is tempered by that invented concept that you bring here from co-governance We are continuously harmonizing laws with Europe and however we are raising walls within our own borders normative walls that tarnish the growth of businesses with seventeen autonomous administrations sweeping each for their own home When certain billing thresholds are reached bureaucratic burdens multiply and say some it is preferable not to hire one more employee so as not to have to assume those obligations and their added costs We are faced with another new missed opportunity as they have said before to address the small size of Spanish companies which have mortality and atomisation far above the European average And the smaller size of the Spanish companies and this low productivity what it does is to waste economic recovery and business growth Some business organisations have come to identify up to one hundred regulatory barriers to competitiveness between societies and job creation This law has not succeeded in eliminating or simplifying these regulatory burdens or providing incentives for small and medium sized enterprises The problem in Spain therefore is not how to create companies but how to consolidate them and above all how to make them grow without being persecuted punished and penalised Experience shows and so our entrepreneurs say that every time you grow up the system puts a slab on you to give up As far as lateness is concerned another major outstanding subject for which this law has incorporated measures of dubious effectiveness and which pose more difficulties for SMEs to be able to access European funds at a very sensitive time for them in public terms I am referring to lateness and do not treat it private companies are not the only ones who incur lateness And as my colleague Rubén Manso said you will believe that with this law you will turn Spain into Silicon Valley but nothing further from reality Therefore I encourage you to go out there leave the seat for a while and encourage yourselves to create and grow and you will have a good bath of reality Only then will they understand that the political industry has nothing to do with the productive industry and that today official Spain maintains an infinite distance from real Spain Thank you very much
"Look you who are the data minister I 'll tell you that of the companies affiliated with Social Security 85.3 1 118 000 have less than 10 workers are not multinationals and 40 of small businesses have closed with losses in the second quarter of 2022 90,000 remain in a technical bankruptcy situation and there are 350 000 at risk of disappearing Look its dynamics are always the same confrontation workers and businesses men and women rich and poor and instead of seeking solutions that benefit workers and businesses together such as for example reducing social contributions or lowering taxes they do not You know why Because it only harms you that with less collection you will have less funding for your mastodontic government of twenty two ministries or to continue to water public subsidies to your labor unions to which this year you have given 17 million euros and we do not know what the salary of your leaders is Precisely the independent unions those who do not dance water to the government agree with the SMEs and the self employed in which it is you who must take the measures to solve your economic problem such as for example lowering the energy bill but really because with the Iberian exception what you have done is multiply it or lower the VAT on commodities or deflate the IRPF by granting more liquidity to workers and self employed people They also call for genuine labour reform that encourages the creation of lasting and stable jobs indefinite contracts over time not in the name With your punishment policy all you 're getting is more businesses shut down and we 're going for 46 000 So do you know where the workers are going At the door of your ministry for you to hire them You know a lot about protesting but hiring just with other people 's money"
"Thank you President Mrs Oramas last week in your inquiry the executing arm of the star measure of Podemos Mr Escriva came to tell you that as you voted in favour of minimum living income as you had no right to protest He only failed to respect that the minimum living income has not reached the 2,300,000 people promised because of Putin or because VOX will rule in Castile and León Because this government instead of seeking well being for the Spaniards is dedicated to evangelizing with dogmas of faith pretending that we believe that inflation close to 8 astronomical fuel prices and the bill of light are Putin 's fault or that VOX will rule in Castile and León Because now the payrolls are hybrid half for gasoline and half for electricity And what worries this unworthy government is not that the Spanish have a job with decent wages that they have a home unless they illegally leokupen that people feel safe in their neighbourhoods or that young people have a future this government of shame needs 21.3 billion euros in feminist policies I do n't know what which is actually 21.3 billion reasons for them to resign and leave According to data published in December 2021 the National Social Security Institute has received more than 1 500 000 applications for minimum living income of which 362,000 have been approved with 824 000 beneficiaries accounting for 35 of the 2 300 000 promised ceasing to implement EUR 1 billion of the 3 billion budgeted However for feminist policies I do not know what they will provide 21.3 billion euros And it is that the most emblematic feature of this government is to do just the opposite of what it promises and in the case of Minister Escriva to develop policies contrary to what he himself recommended before going to the dark side And it must be that it has no historical memory because when it chaired the AIReF and presented the study on minimum incomes in 2019 it stated experience shows the complexity of developing these minimum income programmes during the crisis since in practice the effective way to implement them is precisely to do so before the crisis takes place An optimal design is therefore to frame the implementation of these minimum incomes into a medium term budgetary plan which will compensate for the structural increase in expenditure ensure its monitoring and continuous evaluation And with regard to the ongoing evaluation today the AIReF has to present this evaluation in the first half of 2022 and the only thing it finds is the refusal of the Ministry of Finance to be able to sign an agreement with the Tax Agency that allows it to access this data The minimum living income has become a real nightmare for thousands of families who have seen their income drastically reduced by errors in social security calculations A benefit supposedly aimed at preventing the risk of poverty and social exclusion has become a deadly trap for families living on the threshold of begging Mr Escrivá Mrs Oramas also reminded you that you voted in favour of the fifth additional provision and that because of the extraneous singularity of Navarre and the Basque Country things have to be done in a different way because minimum vital income requires the exchange of tax data and since it is a competence of the outlaws they must do so For I remind Mr Escrivá that in the area of information exchange and tax management between the outside finances and social security there are several agreements which must be ignored by him despite being published in the Official Gazette of the State The only truth of the Government 's lie is that it agreed to transfer the full management of the minimum vital income to the Basque Country so that the PNV would not present an amendment to the general budgets of 2022 in full with the aim of ensuring that Mr Sánchez remained screwed to his chair in the Moncloa The rest are lies"
In addition the Professional Association of the Higher Body of Letters of the Social Security Administration has warned about the possible unconstitutionality of the transfer of minimum vital income to the Vasco and Navarra Country as our social security system can be seriously affected by the break up of the single box The single box of Social Security and the equality of the Spaniards are protected by the Constitution and that is above any dream imaginary republics and nationalisms of blackmail and extortion Therefore ladies and gentlemen of the PNV pay attention because the VOX Parliamentary Group will appeal to the Constitutional Court the Law on General Budgets of the State for 2022 among other reasons for having broken the single Social Security box transferring to the Basque Country and Navarre the competences on minimum living income If I were you I am very concerned because you have already suffered in your own flesh the effectiveness of VOX resources We already know the ruling of the Constitutional Court that has overturned the fascist and supremacist cord that placed in the Basque Parliament our dear AmayaMartinez because works are love and not good reasons and in VOX we comply
Thank you President Minister a previous one Mr de Podemos Mrs Franco we are looking forward to you ruling United We can finally lower the bill from the light You are the government of ruin of lies the worst government at the worst time but also the government of excuses and Minister you have not said it but you have surely thought that the drought we suffer in Spain is also the fault of the war in Putin yes The field agonizes dies of thirst Farmers and farmers want water they do n't want loans they want tools to work they do n't want subsidies they want legal certainty and not an endless bureaucracy they want to give people food without dying of hunger in the attempt and they want them to listen they do n't want palliatives but the chronic disease they suffer disappears and for that I 'm sorry but gentlemen of the government you must leave because that is the urgent thing you must leave This royal decree- law which the government wants to justify under the premises of urgency and extraordinary aims to mask a problem that persists in Spain for decades drought You yourself in the preamble to this rule say that in Spain from the hydrological year 2012 2013 to the present there has been a situation of precipitation well below the average ten years which I believe is sufficient time to realize Therefore you are the Government of the last minute at the stroke of royal decree law and in time of discount but it is that your inaction costs lives With this rule you are not offering a solution to the problems of the field it is another patch to cover the wound but the wound remains open even if you want to hide it by wearing bandages and the longer you leave it open in the end it will gangrene and then the field will die without remedy and if the field dies we all die Or do you think the bread comes from the oven or the potatoes from the bag and the chops from the fridge The tax and social security measures they raise are time limited measures because after ten long years of drought as we have just said you are sure thinking that from June this year it will rain a lot and the problem will disappear What for example are they based on to provide tax relief reducing IRPF yields by 20 Why not 30 or 25 or Social Security deferrals due to May or June They are discretionary measures that translate into bread for today and hunger for tomorrow I believe it is a flight forward without addressing the origin of the problem and without offering a bottom up solution I 'm going to give you some notions of mathematics for progress and basic taxation If agricultural and livestock farms as a result of the rise in prices of raw materials energy fuel and less production due to this drought have incurred losses how would they benefit from a 20 reduction in yields if they do not have yields if they do not have profits 20 of zero is zero This Minister is not a tax benefit it is a laughing stock of our farmers and farmers Since our parliamentary group arrived in Congress they have done nothing but point out to you as a negator of everything Mrs de Podemos has just done it but it is here that the only negators I believe are you that with ideological sustenance and your climate fanaticism do not want to see the reality Without food sovereignty we 'll fill the refrigerators you know what Paper from the BOE which is very ecological and very resilient Since the VOX Parliamentary Group we have put forward hundreds of initiatives that propose real long term solutions to the problems of the field but you reject them by system If the initiative is VOX we must vote no Those are their principles the denial of common sense and the well being of the Spaniards The Spanish agenda that VOX proposes yes for all of Spain that of which you sometimes want to laugh which is an agenda in front of the globalist progressive agendas in point 17 says the following Water is a resource of all Spaniards and it must be ensured that it reaches all corners of the nation through the interconnection of all basins the Ebro is also Spanish In addition a new national hydrological plan will be designed and implemented under the principles of solidarity and common good because the abandonment of the national water policy is condemning rural Spain to become thirsty and dying Spain In Spain we have 50 of our territory at risk of desertification and the opportunity to recover millions of hectares of irrigation if we are able to get enough water to all corners We must ensure that water is a resource accessible to all Spaniards in each region of the country defending farmers against the criminalization of the use of water To date only two out of every ten euros of the investment envisaged in the previous hydrological plans have been implemented so a high percentage of regulatory and water infrastructure works of general interest have not been carried out despite being decisive for mitigating droughts It must be that water is a sermasculin without a gender perspective and therefore the EUR 21.3 billion for feminist policies here should not be applied Desertification has become a real environmental problem but consensusprogress does not include it in its climate fanaticism or its green agenda Our Constitution legally establishes water as a public property in its article 132 the State being the holder of such resources which ensures that it is used on the basis of rationality and solidity criteria for all Spaniards However its arbitrary policies are devoted to territorializing decisions on the use of water in the various autonomous communities and hydrographic confederations and here in these policies the PP and the PSOE both mounts and mounts so much Therefore the distribution of water among all Spaniards is also in the Constitution or is that principle not included in your concept of solidarity and patriotism Of course we already know that the communists share what they do n't have More of the same However we shall vote in favour Minister
Thank you President Madam Vice President welcome after finishing your tour of the Spanish supermarkets offering your low cost basket as the 21st century Red Riding Hood a tour in which you have reaped a tremendous failure And while you were walking through Spanish lands negotiating with the guinea pigs you 've abandoned your competition the labour market You who boasted of the forbidden dismissal instead of encouraging the recruitment of quality jobs have forced companies to take as an alternative the dismissal for not exceeding the probationary period in order to maintain short term employment which in the last year has grown by more than 900 Therefore I ask you Do you consider that your labour reform has exceeded the probationary period
Thank you Your Honor we 're going to kill your story with the data The activity rate in Spain is 58 compared to 74 in the European Union unemployment in Spain 12.6 compared to 6.6 on average in the European Union and the rate of poverty resulting from combining unemployment and inflation 22.6 compared to 16.4 in the European Union Very bad is n't it Temporary contracts which have been dubbed fixed discontinuity have made the labour market precarious condemning workers to a more harmful contract and employers to assume a higher labour cost which precisely encourages them to fire or close their businesses In the official data you do not collect half a million people without work those who expel from their statistics by considering these fixed contracts discontinuous as indefinite According to Eurostat employment data for the second quarter referring to employment compared to the previous quarter are fatal because they say that Spain is the leading country in the destruction of employment in the European Union Therefore your statistical cuisine and your makeup all they hide is the precariousness that remains in the labour market because minister even if the monkey gets dressed in silk the monkey stays and soon the Spaniards will tell you Farewell your contract and your mandate have ended by not exceeding the probationary period
Thank you President Minister do n't worry you 're not alone It has us all in front of it to combat its policies of discrimination and confrontation of radical and exclusive feminism policies that abandon the real victims that try to infantile women and criminalize men And it is not necessary that you measure our skirt and make campaigns of how to respond to an offence we know how to do it alone but not drunk serene and mature We know how to achieve our goals because we 've been doing so long before you were a minister And it is that a minister does not protect or hide her she must assume her responsibility and account for her policies which are measured by their results and not by their intentions or their propaganda Since January 2020 who holds his office tell me how many victims do you carry behind your back Victims who have been unable to protect despite the billions of euros of the Spaniards who wasted in their ministry 151 victims of domestic violence including minors killed at the hands of their mothers or parents And cases of victims of sexual crimes are shot many of them by imported herds between 2020 and 2021 there have been more than thirty thousand Unfortunately the results of your management
The results of its management do not translate into economic losses but into loss of human life And to all this we must add that yesterday the Supreme Court endorsed the reduction of sentences to those convicted of sexual offences with the entry into force of its already evil law alone is yes contrary to the pronouncement of the Attorney General another employee at the salary of the Government In the face of the terrible results of his management why has he not resigned
You do n't listen to the data which are overwhelming The number of convicted persons benefiting from their legal whim is 39 in addition to 10 released Do you imagine how those victims who were raped and outraged should feel knowing that their aggressors are free or will serve lesser sentences But you instead of resigning with your forehead very high and your tongue sharp insult those who warned you of those consequences Its law exerts institutional violence against women
Thank you President Mr Guitarte you know that in VOX we are advocates of the zero based budgetary methodology for all administrations and this you propose to increase the percentage of the financial allocation to local entities simply we do not share His motion talks about the need to reform the financing of small municipalities in order to correct the aggravation in rural Spain and we ask him for what purpose Well if what he is trying to do he says is to contribute open quotes to environmental sustainability and to the quality of the landscape close quotes this is not going to prevent bleeding or the people 's winter What globalist agenda has he copied from Neither in her question nor in the Minister 's reply nor in her motion nor in her speech have we heard two fundamental words today birth and family It 's essential to talk about them If not what population are you referring to today or in the future To live who Mr. Guitarte The family is the institution best valued by the Spaniards embryo of society and guarantor of the future of our nation However there is no real and effective support from the administrations Where are children birth policies differentiated taxation communications transport the defence of agriculture and livestock more resources to cover basic services in unpopulated areas What are those areas Do you know that Does the government know Do you know the European Union Should n't we start here Could we not start with that map accepted by the Ombudsman which included much of the Spanish geography At a time when the Constitution is being trampled on it is particularly important to denounce that there has been no intention of fulfilling the mandates of article 138 solidarity cohesion and balance between the regions of Spain within their unity The Government looks with contempt at the rural areas their traditions their ways of life and their resources and in short at their very identity which have been fundamentally neglected since the 2030 Agenda incompatible with the defence of Spain and its needs causing particular damage to its inhabitants causing further emptiness of these territories It is abandoned Spain it is the failure of the autonomous model up to six competent administrations to fight against depopulation seeking the same formula of financing as you postulate that of always more is better immense increase in public spending and budgetary multiplication which are a ballast for the citizen with permanent concessions of bipartisanism to separatists always dissatisfied with the self government achieved insolidary and disloyal with the national project making it necessary today to stop the coup de Sánchez Forty years of autonomous statehood have left a political community divided into seventeen kingdoms of taifas administrative chaos weakened emotional ties and an unequal Spain In VOX we think that intelligent use of fiscal policy can help create incentives to curb depopulation and increase birth rate reductions in tax figures such as IRPF ITP companies autonomous quotas and incentives to hire We must reduce taxes on its inhabitants and eliminate many of them Without services and with high taxes who will stay in those places The money has to be in the pocket of the Spaniards better than in the hands of the administrations but we know that thanks to the government and its partners next year 2023 will be marked by a remarkable increase in taxes Abolition of the municipal surplus tax or exemption from the transmission of the taxpayer 's usual family home if reinvested in a new one and access to education up to the age of three health services the Internet and high speed These must be basic priorities Demography can't be improvised The lack of specific policies has led us to this very difficult and very slow reversal situation Depopulation not only means that certain areas of Spain are emptied it supposes empty villages without soul they are land without sowing they are forgotten traditions they are lost causes they are buildings in ruins it is buried history and people uprooted remember families and children because as stated in an article whose reading I recommend my colleague Georgina Trias ladies and gentlemen the children do not pollute Thank you very much
Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen new transposition of European legislation into Spanish law on this occasion on precursors of explosives which are those chemicals that could be used in combination with others to make an illegal but simple homemade explosive but this government as we shall see later is unable to transpose a single norm without introducing any discordant elements Despite being legal products such as ammonium nitrate used in fertilizers but mixed with diesel it gives rise to nagolite which is the simplest explosive used in mining and which has caused some of the biggest chemical explosions in history such as that of the port of Beirut in August 2020 or oxygenated water or acetone or battery acid used in construction industry pool cleaning or wind modelling in due percentages and mixed with other substances are precursors of explosives and can be used for the manufacture of artifacts The jihadist attacks of recent years in Europe and the world have shown the need to raise the level of security and limit private access to precursors whose controls had proved ineffective by not sufficiently preventing their easy acquisition But if there is a nation that is suffering from jihadist and separatist terrorism like no other is Spain Let 's see Ripoll 's jihadist cell easily purchased large quantities of chlorine sulphuric acid and acetone substances to manufacture 300 kilos of homemade explosives known as the 'mother of Satan whose build up blew up on August 16 2017 his Alcanar villa in Tarragona with several terrorists inside The next day members of the cell killed 14 people with a van and injured dozens who were walking through Las Ramblas de Barcelona Nine CDRs were arrested while attempting to attack explosives in Catalonia coinciding with the coup judgement on 1 October Sulphuric acid aluminium powder industrial pickling gasoline and paraffin were involved They also had termite a relatively easy to elaborate component that reaches high temperatures giving it great incendiary power Come on peaceful people really peaceful In November 2021 the Civil Guard seized 350 kilos of potassium chloride in Reus a substance used as an explosive precursor denouncing its owner who was attempting to sell it illegally over the Internet A recent report by the Civil Guard sees coincidences in the manufacture manipulation and logistical aspects of explosive material and precursors found in 2019 in a series of ETA bars in France with the attack perpetrated on 30 July in Palmanova Calvià Mallorca the last terrorist action with victims that ETA committed in Spain and that ended the life of two members of the Benemerita one of them the son of my bank companion Toni Salvá The aim is to determine the identity of ETA militants related to terrorist actions committed on the islands in July and August 2009 but the prosecution is not very interested in pulling the thread examples reflecting the importance of regulating explosives precursors But what should be a purely technical legislative project with contributions that improve and complete the text has become in order not to change another transfer of the Government to the separatists and it is that the amendments presented by the enemies of Spain have been welcomed by the Socialist Group which has cooked a transaction with the Basque Nationalist Party in which it gives to the Mossos and the Ertzaintza the control and the inspection work of the precursors which until now has been performed by the State namely the Civil Guard and the Centre for Intelligence against Terrorism and Organized Crime the Citco integrated in the Ministry of the Interior as a national contact point The separatists want to be them not the State who control the potential manufacture of explosive devices similar to the gift of the PSOE with Navarra because of the PNV 's demand for traffic with the Civil Guard Always the PNV always collecting its fruits Not a day passed and the media echoed the news Here you can see Mossos wins the Civil Guard the inspection of explosives precursors Another example Sánchez gives Mossos and Ertzaintza powers of the Civil Guard on explosives inspection They want to expel the Benemerita from the territories by force to withdraw their powers as they will do with the Army at Esquerra 's request We say that the inspection of the precursors should be controlled only by the Civil Guard Weapons Intervention and not by the Major Trapero The bill is enacted under the provisions of article 149.1 26 and 29th of the Spanish Constitution which let us recall is sharp and confers on the State exclusive jurisdiction over the regime of production trade possession and use of explosives as well as in public security so that the resulting rule may be in breach of unconstitutionality We only have to know what the cost of this new transfer of Sánchez to separatism was new support The general budgets of the auctioning state Soon we will know and the Spanish will speak because in Spain as in Europe the time of the patriots has come Nothing more and thank you very much
"Thank you Mr. President I will refer in my speech to the draft amendment of the Organic Law of the Judiciary in the matter of the Commercial Courts whose basic idea is no other than that of residence in these courts the competence to process and resolve all the competitions including those of the natural non-traders objective that we consider correct since the legislative response to the insolvency situations is unique it seems logical that regardless of the circumstances surrounding the competition the judicial competence is also identical This reform will see the light just when the economy of the Spaniards is worse as a result of the failure of this government 's policies and there are aspects of this reform that seem very wrong to us First the amendment to article 83 of the Organic Law of the Judiciary is a capital error Population criteria are established to determine when a province may cease to have Mercantile courts or when a population other than the provincial capital has the right to have its own It has already been said in the Commission that Elche 's case points out very well how wrong the reform is since it has no more than 250,000 inhabitants and is bordering on that of the provincial capital According to the project a city of the industrial importance of Elche could not have its own Commercial Court today In addition the population criterion applies exclusively to municipalities and not to judicial parties which are the territories where jurisdiction extends The difference can be decisive Elche again takes the Government 's reasoning away The correspondents of abandoned Spain intend to deepen the gap and inequality by allowing a province to be deprived of a judicial body We already know that you are more of autonomous communities than of provinces but I must remind you that article 141 of the Constitution states that the province is the territorial division for the fulfilment of the activities of the State and justice is one of them as an expression of its sovereignty What a better element of Spain 's social and territorial cohesion than that which all the provinces have with all the judicial bodies Its plan of measures in the face of the demographic challenge also does not correct it as it does not speak of family or birth only of residence climate change and gender perspective Secondly the Government allows autonomy to undermine the State 's own powers in the area of justice which we find irresponsible and possibly unconstitutional The decision of the Government is conditional on a favourable report from the Autonomous Government Can you imagine what would happen at the door of a negotiation of the General Budgets of the State Conversely what would autonomy say if its laws were to be subject to the approval of the Government of Spain Here the governing body of the judges is emptied a little further to give it on a tray to the autonomies By March 2021 they had limited the powers of the serving General Council to appoint judges On Friday however the PSOE rectified itself but not to correct but to further control justice as it turns out that it will now allow the General Council to elect two Constitutional magistrates That 's right no prior reports and nothing from the Supreme no TSJ no hearings What changed then I 'm telling you the huge judicial mess the government and the PSOE are having This is autocracy we said it VOX was right By the way did you know ladies and gentlemen of Podemos Did you know that ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party Leave judges to choose judges and do not abduct their impartiality Third Competition is also reformed to deal with passengers claims in collective transport which is drawn from the Mercantile courts where complaints are effectively resolved today in favour of the Court of First Instance Tremendous error for the courts of instance already collapsed are going to collapse even further If they must strengthen the courts of the Mercantile somehow do so but not at the expense of moving the competences And fourth and last the reform will be approved out of date This Government considers the model of justice obsolete and intends to implement the model contained in the organizational efficiency project replacing those tried by courts of instance where competences are already reflected in a specific way as here Reasons for legislative technique procedural unity effectiveness and coherence would justify a single project Spain urgently needs an agile and effective justice and Spain also needs a new government Nothing more Thank you very much"
"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the PSOE urges the government that is it urges itself with a GNP that wants to make us believe that with connectivity and 5G technology citizens from the city will be mobilized to the people they will telework and the problem of depopulation will end The 2030 Agenda orders and the PSOE fulfills the dictate with hollow words sustainable resilient cross-cutting objective and tractor policy Its agenda stigmatizes the rural world the most deprived areas The Spanish Campo its inhabitants its traditions its lifestyle and its economy agonize because they are in the vanguard of the progressive elites Neither the PSOE nor the PP which has been in Castile and León for thirty five years will solve anything because precisely their policies are the problem Nor will their white marks made up of themselves old politicians who emerge as the ghost ship of The Dutch wanderer You also need the 5G but to connect with the reality of all Spaniards of that quiet silent and faithful Spain The autonomous system has created numerous centralisms that seek to homogenize the provinces by attacking their diversity and coping Throughout Spain 5,000 municipalities have lost population since 2001 6 out of every 10 Spanish localities Since the beginning of the century 13 provinces have seen their population reduced Zamora Orense Lugo Palencia León Salamanca Asturias Cáceres Ávila Cuenca Jaén Soria and Teruel Twenty years have been enough for almost 2000 villages in Castile Y León 86 per cent to lose population and 146 to fall more than 50 per cent In León my land is 9 out of 10 Spain 's second in a more than remarkable decline In the last year 4733 neighbors 15,300 in twenty years The province of León is ageing and moving faster than the rest of Spain Above all it is due to its very low fertility one child per average woman much worse than the already squalid 1.3 of Spain They dismantled mines and power plants in a hurry with no alternatives no future condemning young people to exile The problem is that no children are born Castile and León the largest territory in Spain and Europe is emptied by abandonment It 's a terrible failure They prefer to replace us with illegal immigration rather than foster birth with fiscal and social measures for families Look this is Castile and Lion You do n't have to tell them what the red color of the map means it 's population loss Do you honestly believe that 5G is going to change color and young people will return I answer them no I know they 're bored with the numbers but they 're their numbers You and you are responsible This Saturday Pedro Sánchez was in Zamora with promises two years ago for example the quartering of Montelarreina which time turns into lies It is the same scenario of a year and a half ago in which the deputies of VOX de Castilla y León proposed measures capable of reversing the problem and demanding the elites of Brussels who redefined the extent of depopulation in Spain Their GNP is very unambitious because they do not know how rural areas work do not support the creation of businesses or decide to start their businesses in depopulated areas with differentiated taxation thus creating employment family and children The primary sector that restores dignity to farmers farmers and the agri -food industry is missing and they decide to make investments through this 5G to make their farms much more competitive We must defend products whose prices are on the ground Thirty years ago the CAP budget was 60 today it is 33 You know why For pure and hard ideology It has to reach the Internet throughout Spain but above all it has to reach the water interconnecting basins and defending farmers against the criminalization of irrigation Part of the abandoned Spain is dry Spain Abandon the 2030 Agenda and adopt this Agenda the Spain Agenda where all these proposals are collected that will very soon apply to the Junta de Castilla y León Andalusia Valencia and then to all of Spain With the support of an important majority of Spaniards more than you believe because VOX is unstoppable Nothing more and thank you very much"
Thank you Mr. President Signore Regó the A6 motorway connects Madrid Spain with La Coruña Spain It also travels important localities such as Medina del Campo Tordesillas Benavente La Bañeza Astorga Ponferrada Villafranca del Bierzo Piedrafita Lugo and Betanzos all also in Spain I mean Mr Rego it does n't connect as you say Galicia with the Peninsula as if there was the Strait of Gibraltar by the way also Spanish This is just in your imagination another separatist dream Wake up Galicia is Spain Well on the A6 or northwest highway on June 7th one of the thirteen vanes of the Castro viaduct 585 meters long collapsed in the municipality of Vega de Valcarce the last village of El Bierzo in León It has been closed to traffic since 2021 when it was rehabilitated after an inspection On 16 June a second collapse occurred diverting traffic through the N VI resulting in damage to all populations and users of this route logically increasing the risk of an accident While investigating the causes of collapse for which VOX already asked the government in the following days and as a result the responsibilities are clarified the only fact true today is the obvious lack of maintenance of our infrastructures and in this case of a very important one in the heart of the Spanish interior of rural Spain which is nothing other than Spain abandoned by you and by you which are more to announce infrastructures and inaugurate them than to ensure their conservation But of course we already know where the electoral revenue is as Mr Rego now claims with this motion The minister absent will say that it is invested in forecasting and maintenance and that there are the budgets but the truth is that an important viaduct has collapsed with less than twenty five years of age something unprecedented And it is that according to experts it is invested four times less than necessary to have the highways in optimum condition It is this disaster that would have been avoided with foresight and resources We need to invest effectively and in what is important VOX has already told you that you do not know how to invest effectively because you do not know how to budget nor do you know how to invest in what is important because ideological sales prevent you from doing so In Spain we have very good professionals so I hope that the multidisciplinary team of technicians who are working on it will not be like the committees of experts to which this Government is accustomed The problem once again is the Government You prefer to design a plan to charge tolls to all users rather than design one for effective maintenance and maintenance guaranteeing and extending their service life Do the Spanish no longer pay with their increasingly high taxes maintenance in infrastructure Do n't you issue public debt for that What is actually what should be intended for maintenance or rather what is it spent on Either we invest in birth in the rural world in health in education in defense in maintaining infrastructure or we invest in ideology in limiting freedoms in raising taxes in making life impossible for the Spaniards in developing globalist agendas ultimately losing sovereignty in all areas Ladies and gentlemen on 7 and 16 June we witnessed the collapse of the Castro viaduct Very soon thanks to VOX we will also witness the collapse of this evil government Nothing more and thank you very much
Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party your motion begins by regretting that the government 's handovers to remain in power in exchange for support and to bring its laws forward are growing We too regret it but I ask you are you not recognized in these statements We go with a little historical memory but not the law that they replicate where they rule because they do n't call them what they call us real memory Agreements with nationalist parties for the investiture or to support the government began in 1993 when Felipe González had to deal with CiU and PNV In 1996 Aznar closed the Covenant of the Majestic with Pujol and a long list of decisions and the PNV collected fruits of the walnut until the Pact of Lizarra Later Zapatero supported himself in Esquerra Republicana the Catalan separatists obtained the new statute which then fell down the Constitutional Court and in its second legislature resorted to the PNV just as Rajoy did in his last legislature In 2018 Sanchez designed the new divestitures for the coup and in 2019 he knew that his governance and his ability to legislate are reduced Hence from the beginning of the legislature he accepted the demands of the separatists including the unworthy table Transparency is abandoned they are seen in secret The objective of Esquerra is clear to break the constitutional order with the holding of a secessionist referendum seen with good eyes by four of the six ministers While the Spanish language continues to be attacked harassing children and families such as those of Canet de Mar failing to comply with the law on education and its use in the judicial sphere causing the escape of magistrates preparing pardons for convicted coupsmen or withdrawing the Spanish flag from a Generality room behind the table bringing Catalonia to ruin and creating a climate of confrontation violence and intimidation such as those suffered last Friday by my colleagues Juanjo Aizcorbe and Juan Carlos Segura as well as other Catalan parliamentarians at a conference at the University of Barcelona Thank you brave men In the interpellation Minister Bolaños was very dignified and tried to justify the legality of the table Look this table deals with the rights of the Spaniards who are non-negotiable which puts Sánchez out of the Constitution lacking democratic legitimacy to talk about amnesty self determination and referendum with coups You are a danger to Spain and to the Spanish With those who attack the equality of all Spaniards with those who seek to break the unity of the Spanish nation in VOX we never sit neither in equality nor in inequality we apply the law With separatism coup and terrorism we do not agree or sit down In his motion gentlemen of the People 's Party we miss the marketing that is the support received by the successors of those who kidnapped Ortega Lara murdered and attacked the relatives of my colleagues José Alcaraz ToniSalvá and Teresa López or several Members present here That is why our amendments are being tabled The PSOE has always met with ETA when it was killing and now it needs the support of its heirs Publish the minutes of the meetings so that all Spaniards know the truth keeping them hidden is an insult to the victims Zapatero negotiated with Batasuna the game table after the T4 attack putting the Loyola Accord on the table Zapatero and Marlaska already add up to 302 transfers of staves putting an end to the policy of dispersion without asking for forgiveness or collaborating with justice and doing so how and when Kubati wants that is the direction of ETA ETA prisoners applaud Sánchez 's approach they say we no longer need buses The PSOE is paying the terrorist gang 's revolutionary tax for bringing it to power destroying institutions and trampling on the memory of all victims Behind Sánchez stands separatism and ETA ultimately the enemies of Spain lies as a political strategy moral and economic ruin trades with the rights of all Spaniards the illegality of the states of alarm unearthed once again thanks to the resources of VOX Thank you very much
"Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen when a government deals with the heirs of ETA with the separatists and with the couplists the general budgets of the state bear unfailingly the mark and seal of all of them If they had to hide the government 's transfers to the enemies of Spain where would they do it Indeed many of them in the additional transitional derogatory and final provisions that occupy no less than 60 of the bill camouflaged in all kinds of consignments Some of these assignments are seen and others are not but they have all been negotiated in the shadow of budget support and will see the light very soon The government 's policy for what is not seen or not seen but which we all know is to disconnect it from the budgets and to make it appear that it is not an assignment If a year ago they were imprisoned for budgets this year they are again imprisoned for budgets Bildu believes he 's going to go unnoticed but the negotiated thing is to get out of jails to those who still serve sentences and reform Organic Law 7/2014 to reduce the penalties that come from those in French prisons The Moncloa 's excuse is that the reform is mentioned in the annual training plan for 2022 Bildu runs prison policy and we can't consent to it What everyone sees and does n't appear is the covert amnesty of budget thugs Sánchez denies what his partners recognize However everyone is satisfied Government PSOE Esquerra who says it is a great step forward and even Otegui says it is a positive news The case the sentence for sedition and embezzlement of the coup the means the elimination of the crime and the end support for the general budgets and in passing breaking the rule of law by disallowing the courts in a genuine fraud of law Sánchez was passing by but of course the Government has accepted the literal dictate of the reform demanded by Esquerra And it is that this Government on the one hand abuses the real decree law the urgent procedures and again the vetoes to the budgetary amendments that is except those of the PSOE without any legal economic justification as required by the Constitutional Court And on the other hand it imposes through final provisions the amendment to its wish of up to five laws with no direct relation to the income and expenditure table for the new fiscal year first the Government Act second the General Subsidies Act third the Law on Public Sector Contracts in the Field of Defence and Security indeed will this have something to do with the ignominious expulsion of the Civil Guard in the surveillance of defence delegations from 1 January fourth the Staff Regulations and fifth the Public Sector Contracts Act They are all clearly unconstitutional amendments as he also notes one more year the report of the House 's lawyers indicating that they will be able to contradict the doctrine of the Constitution by infringement of rights a warning which the Bureau once again despises while maintaining itself The PSOE tabled an amendment adding a transitional second bis provision allowing the municipalities to hide the IBI rises which are almost 99 of the cases that is until 31 July What a coincidence they 're leaving it for after the May election In the seventeenth additional provision the offer of judges and prosecutors shall not exceed two hundred places They include gender workshops Minister absent when the General Council indicates that there are a number of vacancies and that there are 342 members In Spain there are twelve judges per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe the average is eighteen six more judges This causes a slow and collapsed justice Is this guaranteed the right to effective judicial protection Minister also absent The only interest you all have in justice all of you is your control And now a classic so again in the ninth additional provision is subsidized to political parties They will have EUR 111.4 million for their operation for their security and for election expenses The departure of trade unions appears camouflaged in the Ministry of Labour carrying no less than 17 million euros almost twice as much as two years ago VOX 's proposal is to eliminate subsidies to trade unions employers and parties as they make them a fundamental way to ensure their livelihood as would happen with class unions which would have to close practically The proposal of all of you is to maintain them but Spanish taxes must support only what is important schools health centres dependency justice security and infrastructure At a time when prices rise and the penalties for sedition embezzlement and sexual assault fall do you know that the Spanish would decide Why do n't you ask them whether or not it will suppress aid to parties trade unions and employers Be brave Article 92 of the Constitution allows this Let the Spanish decide and let them decide now This week we 'll see how Sanchez makes specific crimes tailored to the perpetrators making a covert amnesty and facilitating the future commission of the crime which they announced they would do again And it is done by pacting with the enemies of Spain so that they support the budgets of ruin a lamentable display of submission and obedience in the Congress of Deputies That is why we have no choice but to tell you resign now leave and call general elections Thank you very much"
Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the draft Law on Contaminated Wastes and Soils and for a Circular Economy arises on the occasion of two directives of the European Union but with such a subject in the hands of this eco-fanatic government which is dedicated to demolishing thermal power plants in order to achieve a radical model that is neither more sustainable nor sovereign nor effective and that involves the destruction of our productive capacity and dependence on foreign powers with the approval of the People 's Party which has already closed the Garoña power plant nothing new could be expected both kneeling before the climate gurus of the moment and condemning the Spanish to energy poverty The fork that allowed transposition was broad but a text with 118 articles emerged which no longer liked anyone as evidenced by the large number of amendments tabled 1321 742 in Congress and 579 in the Senate And dealt with in the worst possible way with haste and last minute compromise amendments something that we are already very accustomed to A text full of ideology that does not substantially improve the amendments and that has already provoked our vote against this House and the veto in the Senate Not only do we pay more for energy for its insane climate we also pay more for getting rid of waste and all thanks to Brussels radical environmental policy Greta and foreign globalist agendas which bring us to ruin and misery As we said yesterday or green demagogy or the future of our children The result is another project that emerged from the 2030 factory and its SDGs objectives of social demolition characterized by increased state run driving more laborious and above all more tax And it is that Brussels and Sánchez create a single use rate on plastic packaging another on landfill waste storage and another on waste incineration which already apply ten autonomous communities These taxes do not serve to prevent or reduce they only seek to collect Already the Council of State 's opinion on the draft law warned precisely of the risk that these new burdens could entail an insurmountable cost for many of the economic operators In addition in case there is little the Socialist Group is submitting two amendments amending the Water Act to recover the hydroelectric fee that the electricity companies will pay The PP already did it in 2015 but wrong which forced the Supreme Court to request the return of 1908 million euros You know who 's gonna pay for this hydroelectric cannon do n't you Do n't you know I tell you each and every one of the Spaniards Economic growth will be sluggish by reducing competitiveness for businesses and harming market and entrepreneurship freedom which will eventually impact on the pocket of all families We will say it again the best residue is the one that is not generated But in the project prevention is little more than a declaration of intent without serious control mechanisms although it does establish a sanctioning regime For you prevention is to interfere in the productive models of companies by fixing which products have to be withdrawn or which ones have to be put back on the market In VOX we believe that the opposite is true it is necessary to allow the R D i departments to know how to innovate the best materials that are free of toxics and packaging prepared for the 100 recovery technology zero waste and other viable initiatives with patents and competition in the market With a progressive language that floods the whole text as a society of recycling resilience or co-governance the true intention is hidden which is nothing other than the growth of an already existing artificial waste market multiplying bureaucratic bodies from the general budgets Its longing circular economy is also not defined The only thing that circulates in the project is the money for subsidies taxes and taxes collected by the State in each phase of the recycling process The autonomous communities will have discretion in the authorizations one more step in the bankruptcy of the market unit and in the inequality between Spaniards The European Union wants to harmonise each and every criterion However what you want and what you are committed to is to develop seventeen taifas markets It is not understood that the same material has different consideration in one region of Spain or another Nor is energy recovery by incineration of non-hazardous waste envisaged more than in the last place and with prohibitive taxation when it is rapid clean within the limits of the European Union and which makes it possible to transform energy into electricity evaporative heat But they do n't like it because it's not part of the artificial and sustained business of their chiringuitos We see positive the reduction of methane emissions from landfills or farms for their transformation into biogas without criminalising farmers In twenty five years we will have an avalanche of solar panels rich in cadmium lead heavy metals to have to recycle them panels produced entirely in China the largest source of CO2 in the world All this is done to the greatest glory of the government with the European Green Pact from whose sources this project drinks but leaving a poisoned legacy to future generations Of course we must save the planet but we must save it from all of you Nothing more Thank you very much
Spain yes I swear
Thank you very much Madam President With the venom Dear Patricia the grass is green the milk is white the mosquitoes sting and a person condemned for the heightening of terrorism has a name and taking away the word for using that name in this House is a shame Long live freedom A motion by the Group of the European People 's Party is being debated by which the Government is roughly urged to restore 100 per cent of the railway services suspended after the state of alarm the recovery of the crew of drivers the promotion of improvement plans the revision of the tariff system as well as the impetus of the Mediterranean and Atlantic corridors which has been somewhat washed up because they have introduced this last point of the petitum which in my view does not come too far from the point of view although it is a necessity as I say it does not come to the point From the reading of the motion and the intervention of the Socialist spokesman he recalled the increasingly common strategy that is brought to the parliamentary debate which is that of the tennis party without a network in which there are no rules no technique no capacity the reproaches are eternal and therefore the infrastructures are eternal in the face of the absolute despair of the spectators who are the suffering Spaniards sick of racquets of left and abidextres The first set of this hypothetical networkless tennis game is the AVE to Extremadura which was promised in writing ten years ago by the Socialist Party 's infrastructure spokesman and now mocks when remembered The second set of this hypothetical networkless tennis game could be the train from Motril to Granada A few days ago the brilliant secretary general of Infrastructures of the ministry announced that he has rejected the project as unviable giving negative TIR data reaching that conclusion without a feasibility study which seems to me colossal With such effective politicians it is unquestionable that we will save the unspeakable in studies and of course in works brilliance and efficiency said in quotes which Mr Rodríguez Gómez de Celis has also shown today That gift is seen to be inoculated at Jaime Vera That secretary general of the PSOE that was at the head of the demands of the Granada Motril train is of the same party that was at the head of the yellow tides demanding in Granada the underground of the AVE Today that PSOE turns their faces to the neighbors of La Chana Pajaritos Rosaleda and the youth barriad and now the PP is jealous of them without remembering that before that same PP turned his back on them I take advantage of the change of set to tell you that today those bikers and dummies who were talking about last week at the expense of budgets are meeting with their banner in Catalan asking for infrastructures at the door of the Palace of the Moncloa
Let 's go to the third set of the netless tennis game the Costa del Sol runner In 2016 the Socialist Party demanded it in the parliamentary seat and the clothes were torn by asking for it and in 2020 the ball was thrown by the People 's Party with a PNL to link that Mediterranean corridor to the Next Generation funds Let 's go to the fourth set and I promise it 's the last one because we could be here talking about the long term networkless tennis game which is the Mediterranean runner which stays in Almeria The Valencian lobby is already happy and the friends of Catalan independence are already happy I conclude Madam President with three questions Why is there no concrete national plan that is effectively implemented Have you ever thought about solving problems instead of being the problem Is it not due among other things to the surrender of the Government by action or omission to the insatiable voraciousness of the independenceists and enemies of the nation I hope that these questions will be answered and I also hope that this supplication will soon be completed at the hands of a Government that benefits terrorists and flounders which is the term commonly known to the person convicted of the threat of terrorism Thank you very much
True Mr. Sánchez careful with the healers are the false doctors those who blame the others for the financial crisis while they during that same crisis were counselors nothing more and nothing less than Caja Madrid Ladies and gentlemen no debate no state no nation We face a session with a government and investment partners unable to agree on what the state is and what the nation is It seems an easy game of words but it comes to the case to illustrate that strange alliance that Macedonian in the words of Mr Sánchez who said that he would take away his dream when the truth is that the dream and dreams have been volatilized in millions of Spanish homes during his government while you come here to this debate about the state of the nation and use half of the intervention to talk about the Ukrainian nation the Russian nation the Chinese nation and the Supreme Court of the United States Nor can it be said that the ladies and gentlemen of the blue bank and the majority who support it are too close to the debates That is neither State nor nation nor debate because while you speak of tolerance you do not accept the free confrontation of ideas and arguments and we have seen that what you called the new policy has remained in a mixture of propaganda misinformation demonization of the adversary manipulation and even at times violence against the opposition instigated and exercised by the Government Between shouts and subsidies this government with the help of a large part of the media is issuing closed debates and calls for reactionaries to which we oppose Of course we reacted You 'd want us to stay compared and quiet They have even tried to turn into banned debates the very questionable principles that have inspired all their political action And no Mr Feijóo I take this opportunity to greet you and welcome you they are also not sterile debates as you have said on some occasion I 'm sorry because I know you can't answer me but believe me I 'm telling you with all due respect and humility These are not sterile debates The left says that there are prohibited debates and many times you say that these debates are smokescreens and are sterile debates just because you do not want to confront the left but the left in the end makes its political agenda move forward It does not serve that position which in reality seeks only to conceal that we are being banned from discussing essential issues that have direct consequences for the well being of people and also direct consequences for the economy security and the most basic rights and freedoms Moreover according to the Constitutional Court VOX 's appeals have seriously violated the rights and freedoms of Spanish people on three occasions He 's done it with impunity but they 're still sitting on the blue bench He went to the rostrum this morning to say that the rulings of the Constitutional Court or the appeals that arise are swords of Damocles How does the Constitution claim saying that the Constitutional Court which watches over legality is a sword of Damocles Nor is it barren to hold this government accountable no matter how uncomfortable it may be that only VOX in this House would oppose that violation of the legality represented by the covert state of emergency As you can imagine we are not going to accept that public authorities or private powers decree the closure of the debates that is the end of democracy Nor are we going to pretend that these debates really do not matter because we believe that our duty is to represent millions of Spaniards who know that the ruin that haunts them is not the result of chance or the sole result of an epidemic or a war but fundamentally of sectarianism often with totalitarian forms that have imposed rulers who are very concerned about world agendas such as the pin of the 2030 Agenda that you carry today in the flap and that carry all the powerful in the world that you now say that they are watching you and chasing you and by your own personal agenda which consists only of obeying the dictates of those who are betting on those agendas But they always forget the interests of the Spanish they always forget the interests of Spain and that Mr Sánchez is the state of the nation Beyond the concretions that each of us puts forward throughout today in various areas of government such as the economy such as social services or international politics the fact is that the situation of Spanish people is very serious and runs the risk of being dramatic if those who do not serve or respect them continue in institutions and use them only for their personal objectives and ideological sectarianism And believe me that this reality that I find I am not happy even though I am sure it will be the foreword and the cause of your out of power I 'm so sorry I am sorry Mr Sánchez even if you do not believe it the opposition so hard that we have been forced to do so I regret that from the first day you deceived the Spaniards by establishing a pact that you had promised would not happen I know it bothers you to remember this in all my interventions but I am morally obliged to do so because it affects legitimacy as a ruler Is it legitimate for a politician twenty four hours after the election to do exactly the opposite of what he promised the voters This House will have to reflect on that Similarly he regretted that those who tried to break national unity with a separatist coup had been pardoned by this Government And he denounced that the project of the former vice president to incorporate ETA into the state leadership has taken to the almost pornographic end that it is precisely Bildu who dares to dictate the memory of the Spaniards and that it is precisely the lehendakari Sánchez who used Ermua to whiten and legitimize his purpose in a sad act in which they have spattered in indignity I 'm sure a lot of socialists share this just like we do This is a government sustained in the lie in the lie of historical memory forgetting for example Calvo Sotelo and I say this on the eve of the crime that killed him and that triggered the Civil War by the way committed by socialist militias escorted from a minister and a government sustained in the lie of whitening ETA using these days nothing but the figure of Miguel Ángel Blanco whose anniversary of death we also celebrate today They are crimes committed one by a Socialist Party and the other by a separatist and socialist terrorist organization You are the emulsions of the old and criminal Popular Front ladies and gentlemen Those crimes that they want to erase are not going to get them forgotten by any sectarian and totalitarian law that they pass in this House Nor is that debate sterile nor does it correspond to any trauma of those who have suffered in the first person the attacks of a criminal and mob gang It 's simple common sense It is simply to understand that those who have dedicated and still dedicate their entire political life to destroying Spain with all the means at their disposal are not fit to defend the interests of Spain and the Spanish no matter how many partners they are And I do not think I am saying any barbarity because the fact that they want to break Spain is something they have said openly and publicly in this Chamber That is why Mr Sánchez by that pact with which you voluntarily move away from the national agreement with which you have sworn right here to trample the Constitution again you are going to leave Spain ruined faced deteriorated institutionally and internationally weakened That is why ETA in its parliamentary version lends its support to them because that divided weak and confronted Spain is exactly what they have been looking for for decades It is true and I also regret it that Mr Sánchez has sometimes found himself more allies than the extremists who always support him For example I refer to climate laws that terrible mistake that the Spanish pay every month in their energy bills in the shopping basket and in the shortage of decent and stable jobs Ladies and gentlemen this green pact has led us to an energy emergency Only some very extreme religious fanaticisms have come to your nonsense the law which consists in renouncing to exploit our natural resources those of our nation even at the cost of the ruin of the citizens Of course it is good and desirable to continue to increase renewable energy sources who doubts this absolutely no one in this House but it is a capital irresponsibility to impose an energy transition at the expense of the well being and prosperity of citizens and always of the humblest Ladies and gentlemen in Spain there is gas there is coal there is lithium and probably there is oil in canary waters and there is very advanced technology to continue and not only to continue but to extend the nuclear programme with complete certainty However you have by law banned access to these resources in this House you have even celebrated the blasts of thermal power plants at a critical time of scarcity It 's been like watching them applaud the fire of wheat fields at a time of famine It is an absolute nonsense although it is true that in that you only follow other European governments Mrs Merkel will pass into history as the governess who decided that the continent 's industrial and food energy supply would become dependent on the will of leaders and governments far away and at times very hostile as we are now seeing And today the consequences are paid by the Ukrainians in their meats and by the Europeans in their pockets But not even now that European countries are speedily rectifying such as Germany and Austria that they are opening up new coal plants not even now that Brussels has declared nuclear energy and gas as green energy not even now you have been deigned to repeal the laws that prevent our economic development and the prosperity of our homeland That is why we come here not to ask you to ask us to ask you to ask you to rectify to do it today better than tomorrow to return to the path of common sense to return together with the interests of the Spanish people and to abandon those oligarchies of obscene fortunes which do not give up their luxuries or excesses which carry in the flap the same pin as you which always manage to avoid all sacrifices and which at the same time pretend to convince the Europeans that we must live worse while their results accounts yes do not stop increasing Only through censorship and misinformation can we maintain that absurd course that forces us to stop producing what we need while we buy it ruining ourselves those who contaminate without limit far from here and again contaminate to bring it here You are experts in exporting pollution and in exporting employment Only from sectarianism can one continue to defend a course that ruins Europeans weakens them internationally compromises our security and moreover as is evident and we are seeing does not represent the least benefit to the health of the planet Is there really no one among the left wing leaders in this House who misses the absolute coincidence of the postulates on this issue with the great business and personal fortunes of the world Does no one really have the honesty to wonder why the craziest speeches of climate fanaticism that we have heard so many times in this rostrum are the same literally the same ones that we heard from the big bankers the CEOs of the big multinationals or the big investment funds Does n't anyone in this House think so They still do not understand why workers throughout Europe and has just passed in Andalusia are turning their backs on them absolutely throughout the continent It is very simple because more and more Europeans and more Spanishs see and suffer the consequences of these oligarchies and powerful ideas that you seem to share but which they do not dare or do not want to contradict Consequences that are not abstract explanations of a Member in this rostrum but that are realities such as the state of the nation that Mr Sánchez presides where public debt is 117 and inflation is 10 the inflation that you are taking advantage of to collect and elude the Spanish and that is the worst tax against the middle classes and against the working classes Energy whether gasoline diesel gas or electricity has in some cases doubled You come here with some fake boards talking to us about the wholesale cost of energy but you do n't say how much it costs in homes These are data from the European Commission Mr Sánchez This is the highest price in red in red always bad and in green are the lowest energy prices in households across Europe This is the reality Mr. Sánchez not the numbers you bring here to lie and to confuse It is also true that young people today charge half of what young people paid in 1980 and that is what those who have jobs because we have the highest youth unemployment in Europe You said that every now and then it 's best to look back Well let 's do it with an example because memory is n't just for wars of past centuries In 1997 a rent cost 46 of an average pension today it is 103 of the average pension And while the abusive taxes take away a large part of the workers income after that confiscation they have to fill the shopping basket or light their homes and re-pay taxes with every drop of gasoline they consume or with every dish they fill for their children And when the taxpayer exhausted and ruined whether entrepreneur self employed employee or wage earner on behalf of others complains it still remains defachable enough to tell him that he has to pay 20 billion euros in equality policies for Mrs Montero and for her dozens of associations of friends friends and friends What exactly is the plan Mr Sánchez and Mrs Montero which is no longer there Make all Spaniards the same poor I remember that in 2015 you expressed your desire I say it textually to be remembered as the politician who managed the economy in Spain In the first part of the statement I have to give you the reason you will be remembered so you may be calm but I am afraid that is not what I intended Moreover when you speak the bread goes up you have come up here to announce measures to collect an additional 1.5 billion from the bank and at twenty minutes it has caused losses for small savers and a scare for investors worth 6 billion euros That 's you Mr. Sanchez You have brought ruin and in the face of this panorama I regret that only an autonomous government that of Castile and León has dared to cut subsidies to employers organizations and trade unions to allocate it to social emergencies I would like to congratulate the People 's Party on having complied with its government agreement because all Spaniards need to see that at this time of difficulty given the gravity of the situation there are politicians who are aware that we must cut unnecessary expenditure and devote them to what is important I encourage you to follow this same course in other institutions I also encourage you to stop obstructing the repeal of the Historical Memory Act in Castile and León and its replacement by a law of concord as it was agreed and to do the same if it suits you in Andalusia Because of course we must cut the money wasted on employers in trade unions and in parties in organizations that do not defend the workers It is clear with what we are counting and with the panorama that the Spaniards are suffering that social peace cannot be bought by bribes to organizations to subject the legitimate protests of the citizens that they see that their pantry is emptied as long as the politics fattens up to the rude and expands to get into our homes in our consciences in our memory and even in biology if necessary as with that trans law that Mrs Montero brings and that she has put up with war the feminists of all her life that now capriciously a man can acquire the status of woman often a young man or a child without sufficient maturity that will end as in other countries when he has made irreversible decisions because of the confusion that you have led him to hormoneize or mutilate denouncing the governments that favored him You must be personally responsible with your assets for the million dollar compensation that the State will have to pay and that is already being claimed in other countries Nor is this a sterile debate gentlemen of the People 's Party an important debate If you are willing to be firm on this issue I would ask you to also have a commitment to repeal if we have the opportunity to do so I believe that only with this firmness can we build a real alternative with our legitimate differences broad in some respects but an alternative that serves to give the Spaniards what they claim and it is the expulsion of this Government and all the policies that this Government has brought We of course formally commit ourselves to doing so we commit ourselves to repealing all the extremist legislative filth that has been brought into this House and the separatist illegalities It did n't shake our wrists We 'll repeal everything as soon as we get a chance We will repeal all sectarian laws away from the interests of the Spaniards and from any consensus that has been imposed during these years from the law of climate suicide to the laws of fiscal kidnapping from the law of brutal promotion of abortion to the law of euthanasia from the law of educational reform to that of historical memory which by the way we will resort to the Constitutional Court to have another sword of Damocles because it attacks freedom of conscience freedom of expression and freedom of chair Also the transversal gender laws which have ended the real equality of men and women creating something so surprising in the world as special courts for men at the same time and I have already told it in the motion of censure that they have made it possible for man to capriciously declare that he is a woman You really do n't get to see the nonsense I do n't think it 's barren to oppose this mistake no matter how hard they seem to have the wrong ones In fact the fertility of democratic politics is demonstrated when through debate and confrontation of arguments and the vote can be undone the mistakes or follies that propaganda or force had become law as it has been during these years of shoemaking and sanchism I have already mentioned on two occasions as an example the law of historical memory that grave mistake that you are going to turn by the hand of ETA 's political arm into democratic memory Democratic with ETA law of memory etarra rather Some believe that the papers endure absolutely everything but it is not surprising because you are installed in the political lie just like your political ascendants It is like when the Soviet bloc erected a wall in the middle of Europe which was absolutely unprecedented in history to prevent its citizens from fleeing and you called it a wall of anti-fascist protection But finally beyond the not white hands with whom you bring this project do you really believe that desecrating graves is the task of a government Do you really believe that the situation in Spain requires looking for fratricidal grievances from wars of another century or another millennium rather Or is it rather that Mr Sánchez requires in order to maintain his parliamentary majority to grant anything and that we do not talk about what really concerns the Spaniards Is it really necessary to have to listen in Spain to a radio announcer from Grupo Prisa a company that has been rescued by governments of both signs saying that a Christian basilica must be blown up and that if possible it must be done on Sunday Have you all gone crazy Has not so much exercise in memory taught them that those who dream of returning to hatred and violence must be expelled from public life Do you think it 's moderately serious to destroy the highest cross in the world to give yourself a sectarian taste For our part you know that because we have told you many times we will rebuild everything that you destroy and lift everything that you destroy from the economy to the crossings I regretted at the beginning of my speech all the suffering that the Spanish are suffering as a result of the worst possible government at such a complex international time and I am also sorry that I have not been able to support the measures that the Government has taken but I believe that given the effects of so many measures and so many announcements no one will ever doubt that we have succeeded and that we will continue to fail to support this government that we have been successful for a long time in the forecasts we made in the motion of censure which sadly have been carried out behind one another And the same is true of the international scene In this political personality disorder suffered by this Government we have seen in this very legislature how the Government illegally brought a declared enemy from Morocco and claimed by various courts for very serious crimes We also know from Morocco that Mr Sánchez without asking his Government Parliament or his party has changed the historical position on the Sahara from a pen This had never happened in democratic Spain When he brought the leader of the Frente Polisario he got Morocco to launch a migratory avalanche which suffered our guards and the neighbors of Ceuta and Melilla When unexpectedly he gave the diplomatic turn acknowledge that I am generous calling diplomacy to what you do provoked another avalanche this time because Algeria opened the border to bring pressure to Morocco and again the problem ended in Melilla in the Spanish in the guards and in the police defending the border Ladies and gentlemen Morocco has an obligation to defend its interests and we cannot criticize it for that The fact that Spain for example has not taken reprisals as it should have done against some European countries that have welcomed terrorists and coupsmen in the 2017 coup does not mean that Morocco or other countries in the face of similar aggravations stand by their arms And now after the pirouette it is Algeria that exerts pressure and unfortunately has a very effective way of doing so because of the foolish green pact which has made us dependent and which prevents us from exploiting our resources In short you have created a border problem a humanitarian problem and an energy problem all at the same time Someday we will know why it has done so but it is clear that this change of position does not follow the interests of Spain Should we have a good relationship with Morocco Of course As soon as Morocco recognizes without nuances the Spanishness of Ceuta Melilla the Canary Islands and the territorial waters Good fences make good neighbors And speaking of the fence and the migratory pressure he welcomed having for the first time heard a clear complaint about the immigration mafias I think it 's about time although you have to understand that these mafias exist precisely because they operate with the cooperation of Spanish NGOs the same ones that you water with subsidies These mafias Mr Sánchez would not exist if Spain sent the clear message to the whole of Africa that whoever enters illegally will be returned that he will never be able to regularize his situation here and that he will never receive social aid because it is necessary to end that effect called that you all perpetuate It is the best announcement for the mafias who traffic with human beings and at last I have been proclaiming myself for years you have decided to denounce them But the question is if you 're going to dare end the mobs Are you going to dare to put an end to the so called effect of which you live Are you going to dare to put an end to subsidies to NGOs working with them I 'm sure you do n't Another question for the bench on the left as on the climate issue Have you never reflected on your coincidence with the powerful with those huge oligopolies who want to lower wages at the cost of mass immigration Will they never defend the interests of the Spaniards who see how their real wages and security in their neighborhoods go down Because Mr Sánchez although some of us are being made so long in fact not so long ago you were in Moncloa and I remember that before your government inclusive language gender laws zebra steps of colors and 20 billion equality in Spain there had been no normalization of that horrendous and aberrant crime of herd rape but now there are weeks in which we have learned of several Today women with this Government are more afraid than before Does this not deserve any thought either Why do women now enjoy less security than before you came to power I also regret that in the face of such a repugnant crime which I am sure is scandalous in this House we are not able to take joint action The penalties must be raised but the left always prefers to talk about reintegration and I already feel the coincidence but most of these savages are committed by individuals who should never have entered Spain Can we not stop painting rainbows in the steps of zebras and ensure that those criminals who despise both women and homosexuals return to the prisons of their countries and never see the sunlight again as Mrs Le Pen but Mr Macron has proposed by the way now in France not Mrs Le Pen but Mr Macron It does n't look like it 's the other way around You are publishing right now kind tutorials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explaining to those in Spain how they can cancel criminal records to access Spanish nationality It seems to us that this is not the best way to regain the security of so many neighborhoods in Spain Mr Sánchez Nor has it chosen well to pursue our global defence that is our defence policy because despite taking many photos with NATO leaders it has been unable to get that organization to protect our African cities but it has been very able to get its acolyte media to say that it has done so even though it does not appear in any text and there is no compromise Moreover you have not been able to clear the mistrust that your Government produces in many chancelleries Believe me and I say this to you with knowledge for many photos that give you no one forgets that in your government and in the parliamentary majority that supports you you have declared enemies of the Atlantic Alliance You have in your Government members of the Puebla Group which should be called the Puebla cartel which for example keeps the former President of Bolivia Jeanine Áñez kidnapped and you have in your Government declared enemies of the West In this matter of defense I recognize again that surprising agility for the pirouettes You said when you were in the opposition that the Ministry of Defence had to be closed and now you suddenly assume VOX 's proposal to increase defence spending to 2 of gross domestic product Well welcome again to the far right cheater or any of the labels that you your Government and your media had placed on us Welcome to xenophobia to denounce illegal immigration and mafia Welcome to Francoism and self government recognizing that it is unwise to increase energy industrial and food dependence and depend on unstable countries Welcome too to chinophobia Do you remember what you were laughing at me in the motion of censure when I warned you of the threat China posed Welcome to oppressive centralism with that state plan that aims to combat fires or with that health coordination centre Welcome to the defense of Poland to which you had brutally demonized And welcome also Mr. Sanchez to the conspiracies Do you remember those strange movements you made in this rostrum when you spoke to him about the coincidences of the powerful with your speech about China immigration or gender You should get them back to tell us who those dark powers are those contubers who say they 're after you Really who are they Maybe the TV duopoly you 've been watering with grants The boss who rushes to his rescue Gentlemen in pure I said Is that Felipe González Is that Indra We will talk about the induced and the assault on companies and institutions at another time In any case Mr Sánchez and he concluded if you feel threatened politically all we ask of you is that you do not order another state of covert emergency because I fear you are capable The most reasonable thing is that he resigns not because there are dark conspiracies against his person but because Spain needs as soon as possible that you leave to recover the wisdom and to fight the ruin that you leave us To do this Spain does not need you to be relieved simply as some believe and want Spain needs a complete alternative to all its policies When you are not Spain will recover the debates the state and the nation You said in your first speech that you are going to study all the proposals that the groups have made to you We have made fifteen proposals to him We 're worth studying one the one she 's leaving You came here with a confrontational aggressive sectarian speech
I 'll be done immediately You have come here with a confrontational aggressive sectarian and permanent reproach speech and tell us falsely that you appeal to unity among all and that we are together in the face of adversity The adversity is you Mr. Sanchez
I thank you very much for that low tone disguised which you have used and more in contrast to what you have used today against Mrs Gamarra If I had to make a summary of what you said I would keep that phrase that they should have applauded that we should have applauded him we know that 's what you like I am sorry we have not supported your measures and have not applauded you and it is very simple Mr Sánchez because after a very quick reading of the reality the Spaniards are worse today than before you approved your measures For many false data that you bring us here there is more inflation after your measurements there are fewer savings and there are more difficulties to reach the end of the month By the way since 2019 no private employment has been created only public employment has been created destroying private employment in Spain You are as always with science Today I was coming with the healers and I thought I 'd put it on him until I told him the healers were fake doctors But of course today has brought us a magical solution which is to lower it heating and lower the air conditioning that is colder in winter and warmer in summer Is that a specialist 's solution a doctor 's solution or a healer 's solution What you have done with that solution is to describe exactly the situation that you predicted yourself before you came to power if you had to agree with Podemos that is the situation of rationing charts which in this case affect energy because it is the proposal that you have brought to the Spanish homes I have not reproached him for having talked about other problems of the world we obviously live in an interconnected world but he has devoted half of his intervention in the debate of the state of the nation to talking about other nations that were not the Spanish one By the way it has made a passionate defense of the sovereignty of the Ukrainian nation I encourage you to try the same with Spain although I know you have difficulties considering who your partners are You 've come here to tell a lie or worse a half truth He said that Spain is one of the least dependent European countries on Russian gas well what he has not said is that in the middle of the war Spain has multiplied by four its dependence on Russian gas Do you think this contributes to the end of the war that war that you believe is the cause of all evils Today you have come to this House to try not to talk about the debate on the state of the nation but about a lot of occurrences and fireworks that you brought in which could be summed up by the phrase who gives more He has come here for example to propose that young people be given crumbs that are taken away from their parents by abusive taxes You 've come here to say that you 're going to fight the extraordinary benefits of electricity very well And the extraordinary profits of the state at the cost of inflation Are n't they going to fight them Because you could leave the money in the pocket of the Spaniards instead of using it in bribes with the excuse of guaranteeing social peace You could reduce your Government with so many ministers and ministers and so many advisers you could reduce political and ideological spending you could reduce the allocation to parties trade unions and employers organizations That is never on the agenda of Mr Sánchez the Socialist Party and the Left in your agenda the only thing that is is to tighten up the Spanish According to you the solution is to bring here a battery of extreme ideological laws because you have announced an impressive amount of laws that you will bring in autumn to generate confrontation in Spanish society You are the one who seeks it even if you then lower your voice in this rostrum with Bolivarian measures in all aspects that bring more confiscation more taxes and always more public spending that Spanish society has to pay that same society that does not arrive at the end of the month that same society that has difficulties to care for their families and that every month in every dish that it has to take home and in absolutely any movement that it makes in its daily life is being extorted by an increasingly voracious State You have come with a series of Bolivarian measures that have a single objective which is not to solve the problem of the Spanish but to scratch a few votes to Podemos There is nothing more to see than the face of your partners puzzled surprised and angry when you have announced in this rostrum as your own measures that they have been claiming Its only objective is to compete with that side of the Chamber to see if it gets a few more votes You 're not thinking about the Spaniards but about seeing how you hold on a little longer in power Mr Sánchez you said this morning that you did not come to talk about the past but you are already part of the past All his lies all his words his projects even many of those he has said here today belong to a time that Spain needs to overcome You 're leaving if you 're not out already You have demonstrated to your party to your voters to this Parliament to your international partners and to the Spaniards that you have no word that you have lied that you lie and that you are willing to lie to be in power for one more minute And the problem is no longer your lies which we take for granted the problem Mr Sánchez is that every time you talk as I told you before you literally raise the bread As you spoke today in the rostrum the Spaniards the small savers became poorer because of the collapse of investment and savings that many families have every minute you are in the Moncloa the Spaniards live worse We come here to say what we think of you but also to give solutions as we have been doing this whole legislature We have come to say that Spain needs urgent and profound reforms and not the fireworks we have seen today Spain urgently needs a Government to expel from the institutions they seek to destroy the nation Spain urgently needs the repeal of all sectarian legislation and to regain the equality of Spaniards before the law and throughout the national territory and to expel from politics those who intend to divide us and confront us Spain needs parents to be able to choose their children 's education and our common language to stop being persecuted You have come here today to talk about the digital language as it could make many children who in Spain cannot study in Spanish first of all speak the common language Spain needs a drastic reduction in taxes and the elimination of all unproductive political spending and that of the ideological propaganda to which I referred earlier Spain needs a real separation of powers not that you divide the General Council of the Judiciary and the Constitutional Court but that it is the judges who choose the judges It needs independence from the powers starting with the judiciary and following by the Attorney General 's Office which we already know who it depends on Spain needs to regain energy sovereignty and to do so it needs to repeal all international legislation and agreements that prevent us from regaining that sovereignty Spain needs to protect its field and industry preventing unfair competition from third countries Spain needs although you never talk about it because you have prevented it a national hydrological plan that contemplates the interconnection of all the basins the extension of irrigation and the increase of CO2 absorption In short Spain needs a firm and reliable foreign policy without the pirouettes that you are accustomed to and it needs a defence policy that guarantees our security especially in Ceuta Melilla and the Canary Islands which you have failed to achieve despite celebrating NATO 's lack of momentum here Spain needs to recover its borders deport the illegals end the so called effect and accept only an orderly and culturally assimilated immigration Spain needs in short I tell you again that I know you like it that you leave and that among all of us we build an emergency alternative to face the ruin that you have brought and left us a Spain and an alternative that only responds to the agenda of the interests of Spain You can stop sighing Thank you very much
Good morning Let 's go to the real problems of the Spaniards Mr Sánchez what measures will your Government take to put an end to the energy dependence that impoverishes Spain and that is ruining the Spanish Because we have the feeling that your government your party and your partners have lost contact with the street that they are not in the markets in the neighborhoods in the bars Because if they were they'd know that people do n't care about digital ethic citizenship color zebra steps gender based mathematics People are worried about access to housing having a stable job being able to form a family and being able to pay the bill for electricity and gas Mr Sánchez The Spaniards are sick of losing purchasing power of living worse than other generations of living worse than their parents and you only offer misery and despair when you should offer certainties Since 2020 with you inflation has risen by 6 electricity has risen by 46 butane by 47 gasoline by 23 diesel by 25 Spain has lost its energy sovereignty with you at the head of the government and you will say it is a global problem but there are different ways to captivate the temporal In Germany you have put your money on gas in France you are going to build fourteen nuclear reactors the European Union which you always obey now it seems not has just declared green gas and nuclear energy and other countries to which you are so critical like Poland have ended up with VAT so that families can pay the electricity and gas bill You bet on a decrement model and frivolities in the meantime Its model is the deindustrialization of the interior Spain the criminalization of diesel and the manufacture of vehicles in Spain the blasting of thermal power plants such as Velilla del Río Carrión in Palencia the closure of nuclear power plants such as the Garoña nuclear power plant and the gift of gas which is needed for the Spanish families to the satrap of Morocco That is their model is business that closes because they can't even lift the blind and families that can't warm up in winter because they can't pay the energy bill Their energy transition is a thyme that shows once again that when communists and socialists are in power families suffer the humble suffer the popular classes suffer and the middle classes suffer
Mr. Sanchez the bill for light gas and diesel Less demagogy OF THE DEPUTATE GABRIEL RUFIAN ROMERO OF THE REPULICIAN PARLIAMENTARY GROUP WHO FORMULATES THE PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT DOES THE GOVERNMENT THINK THAT IT IS COMPLETED WITH THE SOCIAL OBJECTIVES OF THE LEGISLATION COVENANT
Mr Sánchez unlike out there in this Parliament we are three hundred and fifty privileged Get out on the street do n't travel around the world that much Get on the street if you can talk to the self employed stop at a road bar walk through a market visit an industrial site There are millions of Spaniards out there who are suffering who can't pay the bill for the light who can't turn on the heating who can't fill the deposit who can't even pay the quota of self employed people all this long before the criminal and illegitimate war of Mr Putin and in Spain in a more serious way than in the countries of our environment much more serious Stop being the indispensable where no one misses him We already know that you have managed to take a photo with your Canadian photocopy that Mr. Macron is very fond of you that Mr. Biden grants you thirty seconds looking at the clock but what have you and what are you doing for the Spanish who are suffering Absolutely nothing crumbs and lies When we talked to you about energy sovereignty in the motion of censure we presented against you they laughed at us They have also laughed at producers farmers and farmers who have been talking about unfair competition for a long time They have criminalized diesel criminalized nuclear energy criminalized fracking devoted themselves to the blasting of thermal power plants and imposed the green fundamentalism that is leading to the ruin of the middle classes and the most disadvantaged people in Spain You are responsible for Spain 's and Europe 's food industrial and energy dependence but in Europe you have reacted and you remain immobile Do something change course radically as they have done elsewhere Temporaryly remove or urgently and radically reduce taxes on essential goods rather than cash do so also with gas with gasoline do so with light Do everything the Spaniards are waiting for you to do Close Mrs. Montero's insulting ministry Use that 20 billion euros that Mrs Montero wants to use in the sex war to help the most needy families or to guarantee energy sovereignty Mr. Sánchez cut in political spending cut to parties unions or employers Do it now or leave because your government Mr Sánchez is a factory of misery just like your ideology
Thank you very much Madam President Mr. Sánchez you have spoken for an hour and a half and you have said many things but it is essential that we begin by saying one It does n't matter what you say in this rostrum in fact it does n't matter what you say And while it is outside the debate that is before us today it is worth remembering a few words those that said philosophy must return to the classrooms That is the commitment of the Government studying it is vital to understand each other and to develop critical thinking that will help us to face injustices These are his literal words of the year 2018 and the government has just guaranteed the disappearance of the philosophy of the classrooms Mr Sánchez Mr. Sanchez you fight up to philosophy perhaps because you do n't want the schoolchildren to know who Socrates was because the sophists killed him
the sophists like you who have no appreciation for the truth who believe that truth does not matter that truth does not exist and that it is worth any trick or trap with such as to confuse the masses which by the way you no longer confuse Mr Sánchez the Spaniards have run out of patience and your Government is running out of traps That 's why you do n't go out anymore Where 's your loyalty Mr. Sanchez Where 's your loyalty Today we are going to talk about it and it is not a rhetorical question because I believe that many in this House are not right to guess it In your change of position on the Sahara which has been irresponsible which has been arbitrary and which has been clandestine to whom do you obey Its party is clear that not because it was not on its electoral agenda and some Socialist Members and Senators have publicly shown their discomfort with this issue By the way he 's bothered them more than his deal with Bildu and ETA Nor does it seem to its government partners In fact the Government 's explanation for the illegal entry into Spain of the head of the Frente Polisario responsible for the disappearance and death among others of many Canary sailors is still pending To this House where national sovereignty resides it is clear that you do not obey either because we are now talking about that letter that you have unilaterally sent at your own risk Nor do your voters we already knew that twenty four hours after the elections in which you lied to them and we will remind you here until the last day of this parliamentary term Nor have you been loyal Mr Sánchez to the interests of Spain and that is the first obedience that a President of the Government must have It is not in Spain 's interests that a foreign newspaper discloses a change of stance in Spain 's international policy that does not endorse either a party a government a parliament or an electorate which you alone endorse Moreover what has happened is an affront to Spain The letter you have sent is an insult to this Parliament It is an insult to this Parliament to the letter you sent to the King of Morocco Yes that letter that he now denies says that there is no change of position because other governments said that Morocco 's contribution was credible and that it had to be valued It is that you have said that it is the most serious credible and realistic basis You have subscribed to the position of Morocco He says he has done so in line with our European partners You 've gone far beyond them But in line with the dictate Whose dictate Mr. Sanchez An affront and an insult to this Parliament that the Spanish will again pay because only you can think of this destabilization in the middle of an energy and social crisis caused by you we will talk about it extensively and by your submission to climate fanaticism Therefore I insist you have a duty to answer to who is loyal I doubt that you have the courage to clarify this in this Parliament Or is it simple megalomania Do you think you have the right to get up in the morning and do whatever you want and decide what new catastrophe the Spaniards are going to experience Because you have told us many things here that relations with Morocco are a matter of state we know the importance of trade relations that the crisis with Morocco at the border will be resolved that it will be better to control that border and that future crises must be avoided Of course there 's a problem with Morocco You have caused it among other things by welcoming here one of the leaders of the Frente Polisario and increasing it by favoring the so called effect that Morocco has been using permanently against our border And of course by giving in as you 've done it 's not going to work out In fact the President of the Moroccan Government has just claimed Ceuta and Melilla as part of Morocco He just did it after his assignment Congratulations Mr. Sanchez In the meantime the new problem that you have created with Algeria who will solve it Are the Algerian pateras going to increase that will reach the Balearics or the coasts of Levante or are we going to pay for it with the Algerian gas we need To begin with Algeria has suspended irregular repatriations from Spain and flights from Iberia Congratulations Mr. Sanchez On the other hand ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party with all due consideration and respect we encourage you to resolve your internal debates as soon as possible we hope that this very weekend and to convey to the Spaniards a unique position on this and all the others because it does not help the work of the opposition that is not clear who marks the opposition on this issue if Mrs Gamarra marks it in this Parliament Mr Feijóo from the Galician Council Mr Vivas from Ceuta applauding Mr Sánchez and joining the thesis of this Government or Mr Donald Tusk from Brussels As you know and I believe that in that we will agree and we will be able to agree even more in the future Spain is in the worst hands at the worst time and it is the job of the opposition to create a viable and efficient alternative Ladies and gentlemen this government of arbitrary and clandestine actions has again led Spain to a dramatic situation Worst government at the worst time We said we had to change course we have been demanding it for four years and warning him in this rostrum The energy crisis and hyperinflation which Mr Sánchez blamed on Putin 's criminal war were already here before the war Mr Sánchez From 0 to 7 before the war Inflation was already growing by its policies it is not shielded it is not hidden We are already at 9.8 inflation that is we are 10 poorer than a year ago and this rise is caused by you as we had warned by the submission of all of you in this House to climate fanaticism and by the renunciation of all of you to energy sovereignty food sovereignty and industrial sovereignty That is to say by renouncing to explore our energy resources by renouncing to sow our fields and by renouncing to manufacture our products When they brought that climate law to this House in May last year a climate law that imposed on Spain their Paris agreements only VOX voted against only VOX voted against only VOX is innocent of the economic consequences of that climate law At that time the price on the daily electricity market was EUR 79 per megawatt hour at the beginning of this month we had reached EUR 700 per megawatt hour Mr Sánchez By the way you have come here to roar for unity unity to sink into disaster when not even your government is united and when you bargain with the enemies of unity Let 's not talk about it We do n't believe him It is not sincere when it calls for unity in this House You 're an autocrat You want to do what you want on the sidelines of this House on the sidelines of your party because you 're worth it And why did that happen with the climate law passed by this House Basically because that climate law the international agreements that inspire it and the European Green Pact are aimed at reducing our energy production capacity and increasing our dependence on third countries often hostile or unstable countries And he comes here and says there 's no turning back on the green agenda and mixes the green agenda with energy autonomy It 's impossible Mr. Sanchez What you say is impossible It 's a lie like most of the things he says in this rostrum There 's no turning back he says You are telling the Spaniards that there is no turning back in the ruin and misery to which they have been condemned with the vote in this House Since its entry into force the Act provides that no new authorizations for the exploration investigation or exploitation of hydrocarbons shall be granted on national territory That is neither coal nor oil nor natural gas With this law this House voted for the suicide of Spain in a gigantic act of betrayal of the Spaniards which has led to the destruction of our well being and to the generation of poverty ladies and gentlemen Not only in energy but also in industry as we have seen for example with regard to medicines during the epidemic but also in the primary sector You have made the Spaniards depend on unstable countries and hostile countries for the most basic goods for light for gas for bread for medicine and all that while increasing the artificial costs of CO2 emissions How is it possible that given the shortage of maize and oil we have to ask permission not to know who in Brussels so that our farmers can sow Who in his right mind in this House does that seem acceptable to Is anyone in this House aware of the level of dependence that Spain has been condemned to Is anyone aware of what that means for our compatriots in their day to day lives How is it possible that Spanish energy companies are closing or flying thermal power stations when the Spanish pass cold because they can't turn on the heating because they can't pay for the receipt Is there anyone who does n't scandalize this situation have to read constantly news These are from the month of March Green light to the pass before the closing of the central of Endesa in As Pontes Diario Palentino Iberdrola will fly on 31 the chimney of Group 1 of the thermal Deindustrialization of Spain Naturg And receives the last authorization to dismantle the Narcea thermal plant Right now You 're still busy Mr Sánchez gentlemen of the Socialist Party let us ask you again to whom are you loyal In the name of climate fanaticism they have imposed misery and dependence Extract our gas No no Bring him from the U.S. on metanerous ships that contaminate Yeah Coal centers in Spain No you have to dynamite them and let everyone see it so that they see how ecologists we are but buy electricity produced with coal from Morocco yes because we must have a different atmosphere than that of Morocco despite the dust of the Sahara that we have just received these weeks Nuclear power stations in Spain No thank you Buying nuclear power from France Yes of course And the same with the mines with the fracking with the industry and with the plastic When it comes to creating work and future for Spain your answer is no but if it is the big funds or foreign powers that make business you can say yes His is not ecology his is ignorance folly or betrayal Who do you serve Because we only owe ourselves to the Spaniards that 's why we talk about sovereignty ladies and gentlemen We are talking about sovereignty that is the ability to decide our present and to choose our future That is what you have renounced and the consequences are paid not you but all the Spaniards And when we say energy sovereignty we do not mean self sufficiency which by the way is an acceptable credible and feasible goal in the medium and long term we mean the ability to decide what we invest in what we explore in our natural resources to reduce our dependence to increase supply and to lower prices and that the Spaniards can live better He talks a lot about Putin 's criminal war Have n't you learned anything from the war in Ukraine Do n't you understand that we can't depend on hostile or unstable countries We now depend on Algeria 's gas and Algeria withdraws us from the ambassador and blocks repatriations Do they not realize that the European countries are already rectifying opting for traditional energy production formulas because they want to regain that energy sovereignty Are you going to be the last to abandon the climate fanaticism that has brought us to ruin and that threatens the Spanish with misery Mr Sánchez as far as everything that tells us today is concerned I told you at first I have to tell you that you act like a professional fraudster Presenting now some gruesome accounts some triumphs theoreticians who only see their subsidized press but who do not see them the Spaniards and pretending that the debate revolves around the patches for the punctures you have caused is something that we are not going to accept If you can lower one more point if you can subsidize one cent more To pretend to entertain ourselves without discussing the causes that have brought us here is something that we are not going to contribute to You claim that in order to be exempt from liability but the Spanish people are not going to be fooled by their deceptions ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party Self employed merchants students pensioners families all Spaniards want a serious debate in this House about the policies that have caused ruin and about the policies that can solve our problems It has not been a natural catastrophe which exists neither an epidemic nor a war No more tricks and traps Do n't hide do n't shirk your responsibilities It has basically been the climate laws that have brought us here It has been his submission to foreign interests that has turned Spain into a deindustrialized moor it has been his lack of judgment that is causing the southern border to stagger and it has been his pacts with the enemies of Spain of national unity of the constitutional order that which you also tread according to the Constitutional Court that are leading the Spaniards to misery and insecurity Mr. Sanchez stop throwing balloons out The root cause is a government built from the beginning with all the enemies of unity with all the enemies of equality and with all the enemies of the well being of the Spaniards I conclude Mr Sánchez I know you will be happy The Spaniards have run out of patience and that 's why you can't go out on the street Transporters ruined by their policies refuse to work by losing money in every port and refuse to be criminalized and insulted as they do with the opposition Who can blame them for not going to work if they lose money You can blame him you can blame him Mr Feijóo who had the occurrence of trying to replace them with the military In the meantime you gentlemen of the government lords of the sinister lords of separatism and lords of coup who are the only ones responsible follow your own with your dearest ideological obsessions such as gender as the ministry of Mrs Montero as separatism itself which has been dear to Spain as the criminalization of the countryside livestock and agriculture or its climatic laws or as the criminalization of the diesel and the vehicle industry in Spain which is so important to so many families While you 're at it we 're with the Spaniards and the things to eat We would appreciate it if you would respond in this rostrum to whom you obey Mr. Sánchez
It has proved to me surprising and exciting to see Mr Sánchez begin his intervention by asking for the withdrawal of one of the qualifications that I have used in this rostrum I have called him autocrat and has generated such indignation in the president that as I have few readings of philosophy and law as you know I have had to consult the dictionary of the Royal Academy which says that autocracy is the form of government in which the will of one person is the supreme law It turns out that you have changed the position of the Sahara without your Government without your party and without this Parliament I understand it bothers you but tell me what we call this Mr. Sanchez I occasionally read yesterday an article published yesterday it is among my few readings Mr Sánchez by a former judge of the Constitutional Court Mr Manuel Aragón appointed by you in the Constitutional Court which is entitled Presidential Parliamentarism in which he denounces the presidential drift of Pedro Sánchez What do we call the way in which you have acted in the Sahara and what we call the way in which you have conducted yourself during the epidemic passing over this Parliament and trampling on the Constitution itself according to rulings of the Constitutional Court You here call us many things and I am not going to appeal to the president to remove them from the Journal of Sessions We want you to record everything you say about us to record so that you will retract and to be ashamed of all of you You want it removed I of course do not wish to be removed I keep it and moreover I think we have justified why we say this about you You think it is the supreme law because you have sent a letter in which you say that Spain has a position and you are not Spain you are not even the President of Spain you are the President of the Government of Spain You are not the representative of the State You 're not the head of state You can't go around without consulting Parliament making announcements you do n't even know about the Council of Ministers I do n't have a Ph.D. in Philosophy it 's true Mr. Sanchez I 'm not like you who has a Ph.D. in Economics We already know that you are a great economist perhaps that 's why Europe 's worst data at the head of youth unemployment together with the countries with the worst inflation data with the worst unemployment data with the worst debt data Well you 're a great economist we all know that He 's come up here to say we spread bubbles I have quoted news from the newspapers one from the newspaper El Mundo in connection with the disappearance of the Philosophy Of course you say that we have extended a bubble but I have just taken a tweet from a gentleman who I believe is one of the government 's supporters he is usually here behind Mr. Javier Sánchez Serna who says The PSOE intends to deny what is a fact that philosophy does not have its own subject in ESO In The LOE ethics was mandatory in the fourth of the ESO In LOMLOU optional Now he 's gone Civic Values is not going to be a subject linked to the departments of Philosophy We know what it 's gonna be You confuse philosophy with ideology You confuse philosophy with ideological and political indoctrination with multiculturalism gender theory and all those things that you like so much and that you now care so much about Mr. Rufián because he tells you that you are not in what you have to be that you are not in the things of eating You have also reproached us for the fact that Algeria has suspended flights from Iberia and repatriations published today in El Confidencial you complain to El Confidencial which cites official sources from Algeria and to this I refer It 's okay for you here to explain but they do n't seem very convincing given the things you usually say here I was surprised to see that the President of the Government 's appearances have become a succession of attacks on VOX but I see it almost with satisfaction VOX is the enemy to beat No Mr Echenique who always listens from the corner we are not against science what happens is that you are against common sense I mean what can we not produce with coal but can we buy thermal energy from Morocco Are they from another planet Do they have another atmosphere As you know so much about science I 'd like you to explain it to us And no Mr. Rufián VOX has condemned Putin long before you and long before your coup partners who took advantage of Putin to attack our Constitution and our unity And what VOX has done in Madrid is something similar to what the President of the Government has done to distinguish between Putin and the Russian people for the help of the Russian people during the 11M by the way the date from which separatism and the left returned to power And no Mr. Rufián the Spaniards must not be filled with the refrigerator from the government what must be done is not to plunder it as you all do by spending the money of the Spaniards on their climatic multicultural or gender delusions of the silly genre You know they 're wrong Mr Sánchez asks what else has to happen in order for us to respond together Well I 'll answer it to you Look first of all that your partners are not the enemies of unity Secondly that you do not permanently demonize four million Spaniards and then complain that we do not take your phone Thirdly may you reply to what you are asked to whom you are loyal to what you owe because you have made decisions without the support of Parliament your Government your party and your electorate It is very likely that once again we will be left alone Mr Sánchez voting against your new tug We do n't care we also stand alone voting against your unconstitutional states of alarm we also stand alone in this House voting against climate law and we also stand alone in the motion of censure that we are presenting against you We 're used to it We feel accompanied by more and more Spaniards Mr. Sanchez we do n't want to be your accomplices It 's ruining Spain you and your climate policies They are not plagues that arise because of their tastes or the effort to desecrate graves no it is their policies that bring ruin on the international stage And he comes here and tells us about superfluous spending about public spending laughs at those we propose to lower taxes says they have already put the AIReF to monitor superfluous spending Here is another bubble Sanchez increases the Ministry of Presidency 's budget for advertising by 2300 the money will be spent on advertisements on radios televisions print media the Internet and other platforms I guess for your private bubbles
Mr. Sanchez good morning This is going to be the hardest winter in decades for the Spaniards Families are gripped by the loss of purchasing power Inflation on commodities is out of the question The fiscal pressure you hold against the Spaniards is abusive and unfair The house is a luxury for more and more Spaniards Young people think about forming a family but that 's a chimera Light and gas are directly remunerable for low rents but also for middle rents The Spanish have become poorer over these five years more than the rest of the Europeans and that has happened to you in Moncloa That is why we have come to tell you that today you have to explain all those who for example have made propaganda against nuclear power plants those who shut down the financed Garoña nuclear power plant those who have bet on the blasting of thermal power plants and those who have held it on the boards of the electricity companies Those who like you have given up on foreign policy as a whimsical autocrat causing among other things the drop in the import of Algerian gas and the import of Russian gas right now in addition to a new migratory invasion But above all the honourable Members who in this House have supported a climate law that prohibits the Spanish from exploring and exploiting their own energy resources condemning them to energy dependence as a nation and to energy poverty as a Spaniard You try to ridicule the nuclear solution by saying it's for a decade or two but it comes with a pin in the 2030 Agenda flap and presented us here with the 2050 Agenda for twenty five years We have the Spain Agenda for today the Spain Agenda for now This Government can now decide to reopen the Garoña nuclear power plant This government can stop the blasting of thermal power plants and this Parliament can vote tomorrow for the repeal of climate law which is suicide for the Spanish Do n't listen to us ask people instead of taking pictures with people who are doing so badly Use article 92 of the Constitution and consult the Spaniards if they want to continue paying the most expensive energy or if they want to explore their own natural resources
Solve your democratic and legitimate crisis and ask the Spaniards if they want to continue consuming Algerian gas Putin gas French nuclear energy and dirty energy from Morocco or if they want to explore Spain 's own energy Okay Very good is n't it
Thank you very much Madam President Mr Minister Counsellor of the Embassy of Ukraine Mr Dmytro Matiuschenko is at home and apart from the parliamentary debate that you will see here today you have no doubt that we are with your Government and with your people Mr Sánchez everything you have said in this rostrum is absolutely irrelevant Look at how much it is that much of your speech has been constant appeals to unity to all kinds of units in all areas but you have not been an example of unity because even a part of your Government has refused to applaud you A nation 's foreign policy needs to be credible it needs to be reliable and it needs to be respectable You are not credible your own voters know this who you lied to during the past elections and who you betrayed 24 hours after completing the elections in breach of your promises and commitments You are unreliable because your government partners are against our international commitments And you are not respectable as president because you sit on that chair thanks to the votes of the enemies of our sovereignty of our unity and of the constitutional order You Mr Sánchez are not qualified to lead Spain At this serious moment in our history and that manifest inability translates into ruin and insecurity for the Spaniards Mr Putin is guilty of a very serious violation of international law and is guilty of a war that already threatens us and involves us all without us being able to avoid it The international community has a duty to apply the most serious sanctions to Russia for this aggression And yet what do we have here in this government in this House Mrs Lastra who is not here at the moment Mrs Montero Mrs Belarra Mr Pisarello Mr Santiago who was still clinging to your chair to refuse to applaud the sending of weapons you are all direct accomplices to this aggression by Russia against Ukraine you and the Puebla Group to which you belong I am not exaggerating you are Putin 's international allies and through your parties or the criminal organizations to which you belong like the Puebla cartel you are dedicated to hindering the world 's response to Putin Podemos who has been repeating since 2014 that Ukrainian governments are neo -Nazis as Russian propaganda literally says He did so yesterday until four days ago Vice President which I believe still has a lot of influence and a lot of command in this government which has protested because it arms the civilian population when he recently said that an unarmed people is a slave people They do it United Left and Bildu who voted against Ukraine in the European Parliament yesterday This is done by the Puebla Group to which you belong which is here in this Chamber and in this Government calling for no sanctions to be imposed And their parties do protesting right now against the Atlantic Alliance Mr Sánchez all those Putin allies I have just appointed are in your government or they support your government and therefore you and your government are unreliable not credible and not respectable And I regret to inform you Mr Sánchez that this is not just my opinion because I am aware that this mistrust of you has already taken place in several European chancelleries and that is a humiliation that Spain cannot afford You are so used to giving cat for hare to your voters and to us in this House too that you think our European partners are going to admit their magic tricks and their fireworks But that 's why you are no longer invited or put on the phone or thanked for the calls and your international summits for thirty seconds On the confusion of the shipment of weapons to Ukraine which you have not clarified today but have rectified in this rostrum I must say that you have not applauded him or his Vice President of the Government I do n't think that 's very reassuring for our international partners Also at the end of their speech they showed a unity so great that some clapping standing others clapping sitting and others clinging to the armchair without clapping Mr. Sánchez your partners do n't want me to send weapons to Ukraine 's resistance They want us to just send helmets and tirites and tell the Ukrainians to hold the chaparron Your government wants to be and is in two places at once with the aggressors and the aggressors with Putin and with NATO and that is not possible Mr Sánchez Today this Congress should give unanimous support to a President of the Government capable of defending our interests our alliances and our security but that President is not you That being said it is absolutely clear who is responsible for this very serious situation Vladimir Putin And who are the accomplices Some unfortunately and to our great shame are in this Government and in this Chamber But in addition to being guilty there are responsible and Europeans must think about it Putin would never have dared to unleash this criminal war if it were not for the European Commission driven by the two major European parties popular and socialist to leave our continent for a long time in a state of absolute vulnerability and economic and energy dependence The COVID the coronavirus epidemic caught us debating pyrops and gender sensitive mathematics and now the invasion of Ukraine has caught European bureaucrats trying to destabilize the Polish government by defending its borders Mr González Pons of the People 's Party who now threatens to return to national politics when our Polish allies face the avalanche of immigrants launched by a puppet from Putin Belarus travelled to Warsaw not as a member of his party but to the head of a European delegation with the declared intention of the media to combat the Polish Government Putin could n't be more favored Almost all of you in this House have systematically criminalized Poland week after week but it is the nation that has dared the most to warn about Putin 's threat which has faced him the most and which is now setting an example not only by supporting Ukraine unreservedly but also by hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees For these are refugees of war these women children and the elderly must be welcomed into Europe Anyone can now fully understand the difference between these current refugee flows and the invasions of young men of Muslim military and origin who have been launched against different borders of Europe in an attempt to destabilise and colonize it And anyone can now understand the position of VOX and the Polish Government We must defend our borders we must defend our sovereignty and we must defend our nations But for that we must have sufficient military capacity sufficient energy and sufficient industry to guarantee our freedom and independence that is quite the opposite of what you almost all have been promoting for decades in the name of goodism climate religion stupid pacifism or any other suicidal ideology that has put Europe in the hands of Russian gas the Chinese industry and the oil of Islamist theocracies So yes all of you are responsible for placing Europe and Ukraine in weakness You Mr. Sánchez said that the Ministry of Defence should be abolished Do you remember or do n't you remember You gentlemen of the People 's Party although I am pleased with the criticism made to the Chinese Government by Mrs Gamarra still have an agreement of friendship and collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party I do not think it is in favour of national industry our sovereignty democracy or human rights And you lords of the extreme left and separatism have joyfully received the Russian support that was pleased to promote your criminal intentions against our Constitution and against our national unity That said not everything was going to be negative It seems that Europe is suddenly waking up We have seen a historic change in German politics which suddenly calls for rearmament and even nuclear energy starring the very social democrats who have brought us through this cliff For at least a while it seems that the globalist deviations the gender obsession discussed at the last NATO summit and the dogmas of climate religion will be parked Now they know in France Germany and Italy that we need to re-energize our energy capacity including nuclear and even thermal energy There is nothing more to see about energy programmes at the moment in France Germany and Italy while here we shut down nuclear power plants and blow up the thermal power plants Now yes they know that we must strengthen our armies we know it all of a sudden Now yes they know that our security our health and it is important to say so our well being cannot depend on totalitarian communist or Islamist regimes or simply on satraps like Putin But you Mr. Sánchez do not seem willing to wake up from the progressive sleep It intends to continue a course that has been discredited by reality and history and that is a problem because you still have a great capacity but a great ability to harm Spain We have to change course We must understand and adapt to the new realities that make up the world today Only a month ago we celebrated the Madrid Summit Mr Sánchez not what you are going to celebrate within how much which was attended by prime ministers and representatives of more than ten European countries and I encourage them to read the document and thus move away from their lies and traps which we subscribe to rejecting Putin 's threats declaring the need to defend our borders and the commitment to fight to regain Europe 's energy and industrial capacity That 's the way and there 's no other You may all delay it more or less but it will end up giving us reason have no doubt And there were already some glimpses in your speech Mr. Sánchez The defence budget must be raised as much as necessary At 2 he said Germany will arrive Perhaps more so because part of our territory like Ukraine is not under NATO protection NATO must be required to put under its cover and umbrella the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla by the way a request that you of all parties have rejected in Congress and in the Senate for the last few weeks just because you had asked for VOX We must firmly defend our borders and dismantle all the official and subsidized plots of human trafficking that promote invasion and mass immigration to destabilize nations and we must abandon to see if they do so soon any anti-national agenda such as 2030 or 2050 that limits our industrial production capacity or our energy production capacity also recovering the nuclear programme And now we must urgently support Ukraine with all our means with all conviction with all the necessary strength with the economic and military means that are precise defensive and offensive and with the most severe sanctions for Putin 's criminal aggression But sincerely Mr Sánchez we believe that you cannot do this because your allies do not allow it and because you in Europe do not believe it because you in Europe do not give anything to it because neither in Europe nor in the world respect it nor your Government applauds it Allow a new course for Spain and for the Spaniards Dismiss Mr. Sanchez
Mr. Sanchez I admit I can't help it You come up here and talk to me about training What do you want me to call you Dr. Sanchez or Dr. Sanchez Or are both titles as fraudulent as your government presidency I have to say with concern I understand that it is a waste that you have missed a very good occasion today speaking of borders of security of talking about what is happening to our compatriots in Melilla at this very moment As you intervened at nine and a half hours the Melilla fence has been attacked by two thousand people illegally who have passed over our guards and our police probably because another one on this occasion the one in Morocco has once again perceived the weakness of our Government and our institutions as well as Putin It is a good time that you have failed to say that in Spain too we have serious problems and that our own army could deploy on our southern border in Ceuta and Melilla to defend the territorial integrity and security of our compatriots even if you laugh And it is also a good time for you all to rectify and come back to the point that Ceuta and Melilla are under the protection of the Atlantic Alliance Mr Sánchez I will reiterate what I have said to you because you have given me the feeling that my message has not been made clear to you I have told you that you are not credible not reliable that your Government is not respectable You have appealed to international legality which has been violated by Putin Of course but it is done by a president who before appealing to international legality should be able to respect the constitutional legality that he has violated and that he has been accredited in three rulings of the Constitutional Court You have appealed to unity and I do not know what message you can get to Ukraine or to the European institutions with a government clearly divided and faced right now Therefore you are not credible and I say this with concern because you have made reference to the calls you have made to the Ukrainian President to the various calls you have made and I have bothered to read the thanks that the President of Ukraine has made on social networks during the last days of all the international leaders who have called him from the American or European Union leaders and even our neighbors in Portugal and there is no reference to Mr Sánchez 's call They may have the concern of a firm and clear position of the Government of Spain taking into account what its partners are who sit on the blue bench and in those red seats where Putin 's Communist allies are On the other hand I am not going to refute each and every one of the lies that you have raised about VOX in this rostrum and that you consistently raise on most occasions with the help of the media in relation to our international alliances or in relation to our position before the refugees There is no discrimination Mr Sánchez is that we distinguish between those who are refugees and those who are not we distinguish between refugees who flee from war and who must be welcomed and those waves of men sent in a well premeditated manner to destabilise nations and to assault borders we distinguish it perfectly Mr Sánchez there is no discrimination whatsoever On the other hand even if I 'm not going to answer all your lies I do want to give you a thought Did the VOX lie strategy work for them Do VOX demonization work for them Because they 've been perpetrating since 2018 and we have 0 voting intent At each general choice the backup of VOX increases to 10 to 15 and you continue to lie and demonize VOX Already in the polls we are over 20 stepping on their heels and very soon ahead of you Mr Sánchez because the Spaniards are sick of their lies and that you insult millions of voters with the demonisation they make of VOX That said Mr Sánchez I am going to say goodbye with the literal words of a socialist we have communists in the government and having communists implies a distancing mistrust and a distance from the first Western powers The president of the United States is told that if he gives data to Spain that data can reach Venezuela Cuba Russia or Iran because there are ministers of political parties who share that ideology We are the only country in Western Europe that has communists in the government and a parliamentary majority based on all the issues that can further horrify a democratic government We have communists alliances with terrorist groups and then they are part of that majority not only separatist parties but parties linked to Colombian narco guerrillas which is the case of the Communist Party a Secretary of State who is a member of the Government that has been a lawyer for Colombian guerrillas in their negotiations What else this socialist asks can we expect from our allies who have a distrust and a rejection of what we can represent Well these are the words of that socialist to whom you have expelled from Spanish socialism Mr Paco Vázquez words that we share with millions of Spaniards
Thank you very much Madam President What a delight you have Mr Sánchez after yesterday you come here and dare to speak of pride but of the pride of others Imagine the credibility for us of the speech you made after listening to something like that Look Mr. Sanchez you as long as you 're still sitting there are willing to do anything The same has brought to this House the blackmails of its separatist and communist partners which increase inequalities and division among the Spanish which is offered as the butler of those Brussels bureaucrats to whom no one has chosen Mr Sánchez the price that costs you to keep sitting there for all Spanish people day by day cannot continue to fall on the citizens pockets It is true that your autocrat delusions which have eroded coexistence prosperity and fundamental rights are a characteristic and a responsibility exclusively of you but it is also true that with regard to the great decisions you simply simply obey and follow the instructions that transfer you from that ideological and bureaucratic oligarchy that is contrary to the interests of Spain and to which you die of desire to belong Those oligarchies and those powerful ones whom he apparently attacks but to whom he obeys have learned nothing from the crises of this century and you have referred to some of them or perhaps they have learned and we have suffered that the recipe is to continue to accumulate power and money as they erode democracy and degrade the well being of citizens So it happened in the 2008 crisis to which you referred then I will talk about the 2015 crisis and then the current crisis too that crisis in which a few the rich were richer and the poor poorest Then bipartisanism Mr Sánchez I think you know what I 'm going to talk about managed to load a national institution like the savings banks which did a gigantic social work and were a heritage of all the Spaniards a savings banks that were then handed over to the banks once they had been looted If I remember correctly I think you were then advisor to one of them Caja Madrid From that crisis comes the huge gap that separates the ruling class from the peoples of Europe and today we have seen here that you come without tie for ideological delusions while the ujieres have to keep coming in their uniform Having sat next to you with the new communists who seemed to have come from the 15 M mobilizations has simply made the citizens fatten the bill we have to pay because there are more charges to place This gap widened years later with the 2015 migration crisis and the continuing drip of Islamist attacks then revealed the failure of multicultural societies At that time from the offices or from their mansions the powerful welcomed thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants and all disguised them as refugees and sang the kindnesses of unlimited immigration that they said we needed for our birth crisis and also according to some CEOs of large companies because it would serve to lower wages It was others who suffered the consequences of this so called effect on the labour market on the streets or on their bodies without even being able to complain because there has not been a single day when the media have not marked those who oppose these policies of xenophobics and racists One day it will be judged how politicians and journalists have insulted their own peoples and stigmatized them in the Western world The same elites who told Europeans in 2008 that the crisis was theirs was from Europe said in 2015 that it was also our fault it was from Europe that we suffered from Islamization insecurity or problems of coexistence The blame for you is always on others who are the most humble who are the ones below who are the weakest and who are the victims of their policies It 's never your fault Mr. Sanchez This migration crisis was the second major attack on the well being of Europeans Then throughout Europe there has been a reaction which you cannot deny to that compulsory multiculturalism and to the suicidal goodism of bureaucrats professional politicians multinationals and the media We have just seen it in Italy we have seen it in Sweden and already a long time ago in Poland and Hungary half of France has already reacted and Spain will be no less when the Spanish are given back their voice and vote Today in 2022 the pandemic inflation and the current energy crisis doubtless have drawn a new scenario And you intend to leave in the same way as in the previous ones by accumulating power without democratic controls even the Constitutional Court has struck you by increasing the fortunes of the big multinationals by increasing taxes on the self employed and by increasing the public debt that the next generations will have to pay and then by distributing crumbs and subsidies to the citizens to whom the future and prosperity have previously been stolen That 's your recipe Mr. Sanchez That 's your recipe Socialist and Communist gentlemen It 's what they 've always done it 's all they know how to do If they had taken note of the previous crises they would be able to descend from the donkey of the climate religion which is already just the excuse to throw once again at those who have less Because out of the crisis we do not trample on the humble give more sovereignty or avoid democratic controls out of the crisis we protect our interests and our rights And if sacrifices are to be asked they are asked to set an example Mr Sánchez by not climbing the floor of the government and politicians in this House Mr Sánchez the war in Europe would not have occurred if the European leaders had not placed us in the hands of Russia and China giving our prosperity and sovereignty Putin pays his weapons with the gas you buy him and you buy him from Russia four times more gas than you bought him ruining by the way Spanish homes to pay those bills We have told you several times in this situation continuing to talk about ecological transition is a macabre joke First because euphemism offends as you call the ecological transition to the imposition of a climate superstition that has with its measures no beneficial effect on the planet but that has become the new big business of the woke multinationals and of course of those anti-democratic regimes that claim to fight but that laugh and strengthen themselves with the restrictions that by their fault we impose ourselves So no energy transition Mr Sánchez energy betrayal is exactly what this Congress voted for That is why the first thing and the main thing that has to be done by a government that thinks about the economy and the middle and popular classes but also an opposition that presumes to know how to manage and square the accounts is to repeal the infamous climate law passed a year ago in this Congress It is true that much of this nonsense is driven by Brussels but your Government with the sole opposition of VOX in this House has gone beyond banning the exploitation of our natural and energy resources I have had the opportunity to talk to the international leaders about that vote in Congress and they do not believe it they find it very difficult to understand that you maintain a criminal law that condemns us to ruin and cold It is nonsense that is only explained for two reasons for the fanaticism of some and for the dark interests of others Because the reality is that Spain has the possibility to produce much of the energy needed to meet the needs of the Spanish since there are reserves of hydrocarbons in the national territory for more than seventy years and that nuclear power plants could be supplied with Spanish uranium mines In Spain ladies and gentlemen we have said it before there is gas there is oil there is lithium so important at the moment and there is coal which we can not yet dispense with In addition we have the fortune that there is sun that there is wind that there are preys and that there are heights to be able to accumulate energy through water Therefore ladies and gentlemen the destruction of thermal power stations must be halted urgently nuclear power must be resumed by extending the lives of existing power stations and planning the opening of new power stations the emptying of reservoirs must be halted the blasting of dams must be brought to an end a general plan must be developed for the sensible and sustainable exploitation and exploration of all our natural resources must be developed and not banned in this Congress pressure must be put on to modify the current pricing system which is made exclusively for the benefit of German industry the CO2 duty market must be eliminated which is an ideological tax not to say a religious tax it must be brought to an end with the rotating doors in the electricity companies in which all of you end sooner than later taxes must be drastically reduced and a predictable international policy which is endorsed by this Congress and is based solely on the national interests and not on Mr Sánchez 's strange whims We have long demanded that you take these measures Well it is true that we have also asked him to leave and let go of those who put their national interest before the personal interests of sitting on that chair If you had taken note of the sovereign reaction to the 2015 crisis you would have set aside your international agendas and its submission to undemocratic powers Because what you bring us here today are crumbs it 's propaganda it 's bread for today and hunger for tomorrow it 's public debt for generations and generations and it's makeup to make a speech in Congress There is no deep rectification Mr Sánchez and there is not a restorative spirit of the prosperity of the elections but an intention to reach the elections with better electoral prospects That 's the only thing that moves you There will be no substantial improvement in the dramatic reality that the Spaniards suffer until we address the great structural change that Spain needs in terms of energy that is a door to the oligarchies and an open door to the common people Mr Sánchez we agree that we must tax the extraordinary benefits of electricity which have been enriched indecently with the legislation which has been approved indecently by you all that must also be said and it is favourable to those electricity companies in which you end up working And all this has happened while the purchasing power of the families fell into the ground The problem is that you want to confiscate that money in order to give it to the ministry of the skirts at the traffic lights and to the ministry of the toy strike or to give it to Bill Gates who the poor guy must miss Hey Mr. Sanchez I do n't know why you 're scandalized What scandals the Spaniards is that you give the money of the Spaniards to a millionaire If when the Spaniards throw you and you will do so as soon as you have the opportunity you dream of entering the service of some millionaire or with some great European armchair do not do so with taxpayers money please We say that we must ensure that one hundred per cent of what is collected is intended to improve the lives of the Spaniards to a real social bonus to a radical drop in electricity and gas bills and to help the most vulnerable I repeat one hundred per cent nothing to Mrs Montero 's ministry which should be closed tomorrow and if another important percentage is added to that that the State will provide it to compensate for the fallen VAT from heaven Because the State has also been enriched as a usurer with the suffering of the people and has money to give it to the people who need it to live It is necessary to recover the usual housing deduction at the IRPF ladies and gentlemen so that Spanish mortgage lenders can deduct as in the past all the interest they pay and thus face the rise in rates and it is necessary to extend the deduction to the whole nation for rental costs at the IRPF By the way I 've seen you here applaud the social security the social state public education I did n't know you guys made it up Who exactly were they applauding What we do know is that in Spain there has been a social state and a public education with far fewer taxes than there are now We know that you are not going to do anything we ask you to do because you have not learned anything from the previous crises and therefore you have to hide and the Spaniards beat you where you go Yesterday you were very bad Mr. Sánchez for the second year in a row making the Head of State wait You can't do that Save those ridiculous infiltrators for Brussels to see if they can stand them there because here you have to set an example of respect for the institutions for the Head of State for the separation of powers and for the rule of law They pity you or they do n't pity you it 's their obligation I assure you that it is not so serious that politicians pity us others have stoned us and it is so much more serious If you had learned anything from those crises you would have known that among the Spaniards there is an irrepressible desire for sovereignty and to be the owners of our destiny and a conviction that no more others whoever they are decide for the Spaniards we do n't care whether they are unscrupulous bureaucrats high media or frivolous politicians We ask you again to step aside and return the word to the Spaniards Dare to ask the Spanish people about these matters on which they are so sure the same is taken a surprise and they check that the consensus which you believed to be so solid is nothing more than the sum of thousands and thousands of drowned dissents The Spanish must decide and have the right to do so Article 92 of the Constitution has only been applied in Spain twice to vote on the EU and NATO referendums Never in forty years of democracy have the Spaniards been asked about the public policies that have affected them And indeed the voters of the various parties can agree on a lot of things but if you dare to ask whether the Spanish want to explore our energy resources or continue paying the most expensive bills if the Spanish want illegal and disorderly immigration or legal immigration or if the Spanish want the gender policies that you have approved and that end with freedom and equality I have no doubt that the voters of the left and right would vote the same they would vote against what you have imposed on the citizens backs Thank you very much
Mr Sánchez you very much like to ridicule the adversaries and go up to this rostrum talking about the apocalypses with which the opposition warns you But of course you come up to this rostrum also warning of an apocalypse the climate and you ask us many questions about whether we are going to support you but you who are the President of the Government should answer our questions and I ask you for the ninth time when you are going to repeal climate legislation that ruins the Spanish and prevents us from exploring our resources Because of course Spain emits 0.7 of the world 's CO2 to the atmosphere but every time Spain reduces emissions it increases China which emits 30 well China or Russia or the United States or India China issues 30 and each year increases 5 That is the effect of your measurements on the planet is exactly zero He asks why we do n't support him Because you have brought us here to the gates of ruin dependence and even war By the way he is also full of his mouth talking about Europe but as far as the European Union is concerned that the way in which the General Council of the Judiciary is elected changes he becomes a Europhobic in a minute We do not support him because we have a duty and a mandate from our voters to keep infinite distance with his Government infinite distance with those who have supported the energy suicide of Spain infinite distance with those who bring social division and confrontation with Spain with the law of historical memory with gender laws and even again with the desecration of tombs infinite distance with those who ruin the Spanish there are a million more poor with you with those who ruin the middle and popular classes with those who raise taxes to the autonomous and those who are in debt to the next generations and infinite distance with those who rule by the hand of the enemies of Spain and the Constitution You say that the right asks you on October 12th Look no the Spaniards have pitied him because precisely in yesterday 's act very important and very solemn things are done such as the tribute to the fallen to the fallen who have been killed by the enemies of Spain those things which you said those things and people remember a 12th of October of things like that I mean we keep with you the same distance you keep with the Spaniards I insist here you come without a tie after forcing us all to change the temperature of this room but all the ushers have to come with their uniform and their tie up to the walnut You in the Falcon and with twenty official cars but the Spaniards can't fill the deposit You will be applauded by Greta but you are pitied by the Spaniards Mr Sánchez It is quite unbearable forgive my energy I have been infected with testosterone by Mr Patxi López who I see that you have delegated it to him it is impossible to hear you talk about social policy and public health when you use public money for propaganda This year 36 million more in the budgets 68 increase They give money to promote illegal immigration and the so called effect 881 million in the budgets they bring us 65 more than in their first budgets Give money to Mrs Montero 's ideological associations and yes give money to millionaires to the foundation of Bill Gates for very important things But it happens that in that fund of Mr Gates participate many millionaires who decide what they do with their money and you become millionaire with the money of the Spanish but then your government tells us that it does not fund an effective medicine against breast cancer because it is too expensive but to take a picture and for socialists to be placed in international institutions there is always money You 're a millionaire you behave like such with the money And the fact that you present yourselves here as the inventors of social security and public education and public health Excuse me for laughing I 've seen Mr. Patxi López very engulfed with social democracy He said It 's us In 1908 there was a National Institute of Prediction in Spain in 1918 there was a Retirement Worker and after the war in 39 the Old Age Subsidy was created I do n't know if you would applaud Maura or Franco Obviously things have changed many things have improved but saying that there was nothing here until you arrived is a gigantic lie that we are going to answer in this rostrum With regard to the support we have decided this weekend by the Italian prime ministers in a few days of Hungary Poland and the former President of the United States I have to tell you that Mr Trump did not start any war during his term that he signed several peace treaties that he warned Europe that it was necessary to increase defence spending and that it was necessary to end the dependence on Russian gas and they laughed at him in Berlin and Brussels and that has led us to war
Ask Mr. Biden when you chase him down the halls to see if he 's going to maintain those policies or if he 's going to change them I conclude Mr Sánchez by reiterating the question because you are talking about surveys and what Europeans think Look fewer polls and more real consultations because the polls said one thing about the Brexit the referendum on the agreement with the FARC in Colombia the attempt to boost the Constitution in Chile and the voters said the opposite when they were able to vote Less polls and ask the Spaniards if they want the energy suicide that you and this Chamber have voted for or if they want the Spaniards to have energy sovereignty Thank you very much
Mr Sánchez it is inescapable to remember your sentence this Monday I literally read it to you one of the things I 'm going to go through in history Whatever such a thing the grave thing is to hear him speak in those terms Do n't you feel ridiculous Are you not aware that we perceive you absolutely full of vanity and lack of modesty Do you imagine any other leader talking about himself in those terms It costs me Maybe Nero or Caligula But the truth is that you are convinced that it will pass to history and on this occasion I have to give you the reason You will pass to history but not primarily for digging up dead and preventing your rest however grave this is You will pass into history for having yielded to all the pretensions of communists separatists embezzlers and sedious therefore of coups You will pass to history for having destroyed everything that worked in Spain And you will be remembered among other things as the president who assaulted Congress and tried to gag the opposition You will be remembered by a climate law that has condemned
to their own people to pay the highest energy bills in history It will pass into history for its fiscal voraciousness also against families against autonomous and against middle classes to then hand it over to the powerful trade unions employers parties and even foreign billionaires You will pass into history for having suspended the rights and freedoms of the Spaniards for a year with two states of alarm declared unconstitutional You will pass into history for having lowered the crime of embezzlement to content the corrupt and the crime of sedition to get the vote to budgets by the thugs You will be remembered as the president who lied to his own socialist voters and do not doubt it you will also be remembered as the president who incorporated in the words of his previous vice president in the leadership of the state parties that defend condemned terrorism that is to say terrorists And I 'd like you to answer me because there 's one year left for you What else are you going to do to give in to extremists separatists and terrorists And if you can also tell us what is called the partners of the terrorists in this House What 's your name Mr. Sanchez
"Thank you very much Madam President Madam Minister a previous comment You have n't stopped here from talking about consensus but you know what 's out there is a strike right The Government is bringing us today a package of measures for road hauliers a package like everything they do which is deficient On July 23 2020 the Ministry of Transport Mobility and Urban Agenda undertook to study much of the sector 's claims and yet what brings us to this House today is more than insulting road hauliers They left them out of aid for fleet transformation left them out of direct aid for support for business solvency and reduced aid for the abandonment of the profession by EUR 16,000 And where are the 200 million that still owes them the health cent What about your safety Where 's your security Only thirty seven parking lots are considered safe having resulted in an increase in the theft of cargo police stations on board trucks and attacks on drivers not to mention that they have not yet been recognized all that they did for the Spaniards during the illegal confinement Then they demonstrated their capacity in deplorable conditions reducing the rest periods and putting the supply of the Spaniards to their own safety without an open bar where they could have a coffee not a single place where they could clean up But you guys that does n't matter You do n't care about transporters That 's why they left them out of aid that 's why they do n't pay them what they owe that 's why they continue to suffer assaults and thefts on their goods They are focused on their dark Agenda 2030 and the even darker interests of the radical ecolobbies that mark it From the interventions of the rest of the parliamentary groups I can conclude that it seems that with this royal decree they have managed to divert attention from what is really important This government follows a globalist agenda that captures the Europeanist positions of an energy policy that harms our transporters It is an agenda that wants to prevent private road traffic In Spain 95 of freight transport is carried out by road and this seems to clash with its beloved 2030 Agenda and its emission quota Of course our transporters will have to buy a Falcon in order to fight climate change as our president does by the way then declares it a state secret And they want to end our transporters in the only way they know by suffocating the sector We have the Eurovignette as a new toll on heavy trucks sanctions such as the premium for excess CO2 emissions or the deorbited rise in the price of hydrocarbons Gas oil accounts for one third of the costs of a sector in which six out of ten workers are self employed or companies with fewer than three trucks because we talk about family businesses we talk about families The price of fuel is the most expensive in history not even in 2008 or 2009 when oil reached 140 dollars a barrel we paid 2 euros per litre of gasoline And why Well you said it here it 's Putin 's fault Putin's Franco's or the heteropatriarchy anyone 's fault if they do n't recognize political responsibilities However this government is pocketing no less than EUR 250 million a month for the rise of fuels because let us remember the taxes that charge them are 21 VAT and more than 30 excise duties And far from compensating for these measures by reducing hydrocarbon taxes as other states such as Poland have already done as those 250 million go very well they go and tell the carriers to solve the paper themselves with the impact on prices and so on Just as VOX is on the side of our field to protect our farmers from unfair foreign competition we are on the side of our carriers which are a key strategic sector that should be a priority for this government And in case all this is not enough they also want to implement a payment system on all the high capacity roads in Spain In this regard my parliamentary group took a non-legislative motion to prevent this new abuse to the Transport Committee meeting on 24 February Well all the groups in line with that globalist agenda voted against except for the People 's Parliamentary Group and I say except for the vote because we all know that some of its leaders also obey the globalist agenda The multiple and repeated VOX proposals for this sector have been systematically rejected Not a single measure that gives them oxygen families that lose their livelihood and their trucks and have nowhere to survive and give them structural answers Thus every step this Government takes is one more step towards the poverty and ruin of all Spaniards If they really cared about transporters they would lower taxes on hydrocarbons and eliminate the commitment made with Brussels to implement a payment system on all high capacity roads in Spain the Eurovignette or green taxes However they suffocate them just as they suffocate all Spaniards with the rise of the price of light and gas the announcement of new taxes or inflation triggered And why are they suffocating them To distribute 20 billion in inequality policies and to maintain the most expensive government structure in Spain 's history They come here with the tougher face than the sole of a shoe to bring a package of measures that have had the little shame of calling measures to improve the sustainability of the transport of goods by road and the operation of the logistics chain It is a real insult when it is precisely this Government that is responsible for the increase in prices and the cause of the situation in which our carriers find themselves And that 's why I 'd like the minister to listen to me but the message goes to the Spaniards do n't worry For this reason and for 20 billion more reasons I encourage all transporters to join as we will do this Saturday the 19th in the demonstration convened by the Union Solidarity before the municipalities of all Spain not for those grateful stomachs of Workers Commissions and UGT which were manifested when the price of light was 70 euros megawatt hour but they do not do it today that costs 545 They 'll still be digesting the seafood As our spokesman says the Spaniards will only get ahead when we leave them behind Thank you very much"
"Thank you very much Mr President Last year this Government raised the salary of senior officials of the Ministry of Transport while leaving thousands of families unemployed and closing the Spanish business This year the entire Government has raised its salary as inflation goes off and households have to be covered with fatter blankets because their climate fanaticism makes them unable to pay for heating And the minister tells us that this budget that of her ministry is the most social in history Not for transporters Minister whose retirement aid is maintained at less than 10 million although more than half of the applicants are excluded due to a lack of budget depriving them of a decent retirement He 's been reading budgets for half an hour but he's had the little shame of not quoting this item It will be that the transporters are part of those whom his Government calls rich Or perhaps they do n't deserve it because as you yourself have said they are ultra right groups that are trying to subdue this country and that are playing the game to Putin are n't they Minister There are 10 million for transporters and 190 million for their migration policies which as the former Minister of Transport acknowledged two years ago are ambitious broad exceed this ministry and follow the guidelines marked by a globalist agenda Of course it was ceased immediately after making these statements which they tried to make disappear They are the government of propaganda but what they hide behind are the sickle and the hammer and the Davos Forum of course They 're wolves with lamb skin They say that these budgets are the most social in history but as I have told you they deprive transporters of a dignified abandonment But not just that They say they take care of the working classes but they suffocate them with taxes They talk about depoliticizing justice but what they want is their control They say they protect minors and women but they take rapists out of jail and oppose the investigation of the prostitution of children under guardianship in the Balearic Islands They say they want to end corruption but they want to eliminate the crimes of sedition and embezzlement They say that pollution must be stopped but our autocrat president mobilizes an Airbus and the Falcon to attend the Climate Summit And here the People 's Party does not differ at all from the socialists because Feijóo another accomplice of the same globalist agenda calls for the removal of vehicles of more than ten years from a pen which will cause tens of thousands of families to run out of cars making it a luxury property and Moreno asks Sánchez that the 2025 summit the Climate Summit be held in Andalusia We deserve it he says No ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party and the Government what the Spaniards deserve are budgets that watch over their present and their future and that do not spoil the fruit of their tax based work to waste in a distribution of the cake intended to secure the government pacts with those who want to destroy Spain What they deserve are budgets that guarantee the welfare state of all Spaniards not politicians trade unions and chiringuitos What they deserve are budgets that allow young people to access a home form a family be able to save and prosper and not have to look at the price of what it means to fill the petrol tank or turn on the heating In short they deserve budgets that do not obey an imposed agenda that no Spanish has chosen because who voted for their destructive 2030 Agenda gentlemen of the government The star measure is 665 million for the free travel of nearby and mid-distance a measure that in the face of lack of control has caused chaos and that trains travel practically empty despite being complete preventing other users from making use of the train And this as Renfe 's rates increase for AVE and long distance and also as plane tickets increase no less than 24 compared to 2019 and AENA depends on a regulatory solution to save its electric cost because oh surprise we depend energetically on third countries He talks about a long list of infrastructure budgets that since you have no time limit it is impossible for me to repeat but I answer him with one word enough for me inexecutions Infrastructure projects carried out year after year and the few that run are at least insulting such as the Extremadura pedal train Could you explain to me by the way what are those infrastructures with a gender perspective as you tell us In housing the illegal occupation in Spain has increased by 40 since 2018 not a single euro of these budgets is destined to combat the occupation but of course according to the Minister of Equality is a problem invented by the right By the way we are all invited to the forum that is being held this Friday by the VOX Parliamentary Group on Okupation and Inqui Okupation There will be great professionals and victims of this phenomenon Maybe they learn something She talks to us Minister about housing development What was your 2018 Plan 20,000 homes I 'm telling you all propaganda zero delivered The housing law for its part has been stuck for two years Its approval is delaying the Government because the repression of the General Council of the Judiciary including a negative report which rejects the Government 's housing law has already taken place Nevertheless both the minister and government representatives say that they will move forward with the agreed text And what does this remind us of The law alone is yes It is aimed directly at destroying what they claim to protect in this case it will destroy the supply of housing making it even more impossible to access it especially the working classes A whole history to remember They are writing the most harmful pages of Spanish politics Finally there can be no support for budgets based on the abolition of the crime of sedition which should not be reduced on the pretext of being homologated with Europe Why do n't they get homologated in the condemnation of communism who by the way invented Czechs to torture and murder That is what I remind the Member of Podemos who said this morning that democracy in Spain exists thanks to the communists This regime has been condemned by Europe to equate it to Nazism for its crimes and you on the other hand not only govern with communists but also pay them for institutional publicity with the money of all Spaniards commemorating the centenary of the Communist Party of Spain whose criminal ideology had to set a steel curtain from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea so that no one would escape from its tyranny which has enslaved the island of Cuba and which causes Venezuelans to emigrate for millions I 'm on my way The Sanchist Government arrived on a motion of censure and was going to end corruption Yes they are going to end it but by way of the repeal both of the sedition in exchange for the coups approval of these budgets as well as the embezzlement of public flows and by the way save Sánchez and Griñán for the personal eagerness to stay in Moncloa and secure his own welfare state They sell Spain to the worst bidders and with the money of all Spaniards In conclusion Mr President As you have said Minister you are not willing to give up any vote but you are willing to give up your dignity to approve these ruin budgets Thank you very much"
Why has the government intended to disqualify transporters on account of their protest
On 17 March he spotted the carriers of ultra right groups who are trying to subject this country and asked not to legitimize their actions which he called violent and said they are replacing the word with sticks stones and nails Minister have you seen any containers burned or injured by throwing stones Because I remind you that your minions do throw stones at us but then for you it is ketchup They should be made to look at what they consider violent I am not going to sit with a group of radicals who are acting violently you said blackmail sabotage and boycott qualified your strike He called the truckers on strike ultras and puppets from the far right He was followed by the Minister of Finance accusing Putin of playing the game and seeking instability You decriminalized violent pickets and now that the strike is against this government of hunger and misery you forbid through an order from the Interior that there be talk of strike and picketing criminalizing the transporters who go out desperate classifying them as activists And they use our glorious forces and state security forces sending them tens of thousands to the streets banning our truckers the most basic fundamental right to strike with sanctions of 3000 euros A real coercion against a fundamental right such as that of the strike We are carriers not terrorists they are forced to say to defend themselves against the harassment and overthrow of this government He even asked us to explain why you supported what you called a radical minority It will not be so minority when Antonio comes up with a new state of alarm and intends to use our military as squirrels an instrument that by the way loves our autocrat president because he gives him absolute full powers or at least to trample on our fundamental rights The truckers whom you have called ultras radical and violent are families in need because of your Government who ask to be able to bring a plate to the table and that their children do not lack bread but above all they ask for respect You 've lost the streets and the story As the president of the platform said The union of the Spaniards is the largest we are getting The Spaniards are with our truckers VOX is with our truckers You have been left alone with your subsidized class unions and even with 78 million euros of subsidies you have managed to kidnap the streets There is very little left for them to be left without a public chair one or the other as soon as the Spaniards have the opportunity to speak in the polls as they are doing in the streets and VOX giving him voice from the institutions Thank you very much
"Thank you very much Mr President The Socialist Group which is also the party of the Government calls on this House to be complicit in the use of computer tools for the geolocation of citizens data belonging exclusively to their legitimate owners As the Spanish Agenda says we must defend the national and personal sovereignty of this data something that in 2018 already used the then Ministry of Development through a pilot plan with big data technology bidding by the way of 2017 when governing the People 's Party and that is that it mounts mounts both PSOE and PP PP and PSOE one puts the ideas and the other executes them Let me ask you did it help you Have infrastructure routes or connections improved Did they co-ordinate the territory with that pilot plan No you have n't done anything well yes spending 300,000 euros of the Spaniards on that pilot plan because if there 's one thing you all know how to do here is to spend the money of the Spaniards And not only do they not pay the Spaniards for their data but they have the little shame of costing with their money that attack on their own privacy right against which as I said both the People 's Party and the Socialist Party have attacked Apparently the use of big data for statistical and analytical purposes might seem useful as long as the statistics do n't make them Tezanos of course Even if it does n't matter when the statistics are not in the Executive 's favor they end up putting their dirty hands in any way as has happened with the GDP and CPI data of the National Institute of Statistics which after being questioned by the Government and with alleged accusations of interference by the Executive have mysteriously ended with the resignation of the President of the institution As I said although apparently they might seem useful the truth is that first of all as we have seen despite the fact that a pilot plan has already been implemented no less than five years ago they have done absolutely nothing Secondly if we look at the report of the 2018 pilot plan itself we do not have personal consent The use of big data technology means using mobile antenna records to track citizens recording data every time the device interacts with the network calls messages or Internet connections as long as there is an update of the mobile device or even the change of coverage area This study even draws up an activity log in which the associated information details where we sleep when we leave home when we go to work when we return if there are types of unusual activities in our routine and how far our home is And even though they tell us about anonymous data how to trust the party that has reached the government with lies Anonymous Who knows Agreed Not at all A very clear violation of the right to personal and family privacy as well as the secrecy of the communications contained in article 18 of our Constitution Can you imagine that amount of data in the hands of a government that in just two and a half years of legislature has violated the most fundamental rights of the Spaniards has declared two states of unconstitutional alarm and the closure of the House of Representatives of National Sovereignty Can you imagine that amount of data in the hands of the socialists By the way one question was Mr. President 's espionage with big data or without big data Because we still do n't have that very clear As for emptied Spain you have abandoned them the Socialist Party and the People 's Party turning over the government all these years and now you want to make them believe that with a technology called big data you will miraculously solve your problems Look the study of the pilot plan specifically indicates that the proximity of the tracks would not make it possible to distinguish between terrestrial means in rural areas as well as the fact that users are picked up by the same antennas and this makes the lack of precision up to several kilometers in rural areas Why do n't you stop fooling the Spaniards In conclusion this initiative sets as an example of its effectiveness in the explanatory statement the very management that this Government would have done of the health crisis of COVID in particular geolocation an application that it did was to control citizens and not the virus and failed dramatically If the outcome of the initiative is going to be the same as what they have done with the management of the pandemic it is better that they do nothing Thank you very much"
Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen today is a sad day for Spanish sport a sad day because it is going to pass the worst Sport Law in the history of democracy in this country Although today we must vote on the changes introduced by the Senate they will allow me to emphasize our frontal rejection of the bill that is expected to emerge from this House The Sport Bill was originally proposed as a tool to meet the current needs of the sport sector since the current law dates back to 1990 A new Sport Law that was certainly necessary and was thus being requested by the different actors of the sport However instead of attending to your needs and requests you have perverted the Law of Sport using it for your purposes and those of your partners and friends It has been developed with a harmful legislative technique and with clear and numerous shortcomings as the experts have denounced It turned out that what was behind were the European funds and hence the haste to carry out the project was whatever it was without taking into account the real needs and voice of the sporting world They could n't have done any worse They have introduced gender ideology and the 2030 Agenda into the world of sport incredible and disappointing They have left the Administrative Court of Sport the TAD almost without competence sticking to the wishes of certain sports federations for which the court was annoyed a total irresponsibility Let me put it this way they 've taken it out of the way They have eliminated the possibility that clubs and sportsmen can appeal to the Administrative Court of Sport the sanctions imposed by sports federations and have done so without giving the slightest explanation because of course it is difficult to explain to citizens that they are going to leave clubs and sportsmen helpless while giving more power to sports federations It is for the Higher Sports Council to have the power to sanction directly the presidents of the sports federations or rather the power to sanction them because to date it has been a rule to place complaints against the federative leaders in a drawer and look elsewhere With this law you increase the power of the Higher Sports Council to continue to do so They have also allowed autonomous sports teams to compete internationally at the official level a new concession to the independence and separatist parties I remind you that FIFA and UEFA at the time rejected the formal request made by the Basque Football Federation in December 2020 for full membership in both bodies On the other hand and this is serious they have left absolutely unprotected women sportsmen because in parallel they have processed the trans law law that allows to change sex in the Civil Registry so that a man can count as a woman and participate in women 's sports competitions Make it very clear We are seeing that in Spain because of the trans autonomic laws adopted by you some men are robbing women of their place in sport their titles their podiums and their prizes Specifically the pichichi of the Madrid Women 's League is a 37 year old male who identifies himself as a woman For him to compete in the women 's league gentlemen of the PSOE a woman has had to stay out but it seems that no one neither do you cares this fact They are playing with the effort constancy discipline and illusions of girls adolescents and women who see sport as a philosophy of life All of this could have been saved as proposed by VOX by ensuring that when sports competitions were for sex real sex biological sex was taken care of However inexplicably all the groups the PP and absolutely all less Citizens who abstained voted against Let 's get this straight VOX has stood alone defending women 's sport And not enough with all this we have learned from the State 's Official Gazette that the Council of Ministers at the request of the Minister of Culture and Sport Don Miquel Iceta whom I do not see recently adopted a real decree granting a grant of EUR 1 million to the Youth Sport Foundation for the development of an updated model of Spanish sport a foundation belonging to the Higher Sports Council itself once the draft Sports Law has been approved In other words do I first approve the regulatory law of a sector and then commission a study on what model should be reflected in that law This ladies and gentlemen is unheard of and a veritable waste of public revenue Gentlemen of the Government cancel this subsidy because it is an amount intended for useless work when the law is already being passed and is therefore an absolute expense EUR 1 million to be earmarked for other purposes In their consciences they will have been the creators of the worst Sports Law of our democracy a law they have used to put their propaganda and content their partners rather than watch over the sports sector A law that removes powers from the Administrative Court of Sport
I 'm finishing up President and that does not protect women sportsmen from their trans laws The Spanish sport will pay for this serious error the Spanish sport does not deserve this treatment I 'm done President Our group hopes that all this can be amended after the electoral roll that is becoming increasingly clear that will occur Our glorious Spanish nation cannot continue to allow the dislates of this present government Thank you very much
Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen in VOX we are fully committed to the challenge that Spanish society faces of getting as close as possible to a scenario where general accessibility is a universal right Within this accessibility one particularly important aspect in which we have an obligation to move forward is of course cognitive accessibility We understand for this the quality that messages of any kind that are displayed in the public or social sphere must meet so that all people or at least most of them can understand them easily It is clear that such cognitive accessibility is key to the effective exercise of certain rights such as the right to health the right to education employment culture mobility and even political rights such as the right to vote We also see how the scope of cognitive accessibility goes beyond people with disabilities We live in a very complex world where social and technological changes are accelerating in a truly dizzying way This is causing a deep rift between those who have access to information for example because of the ability to handle digital or technological tools and those who have left behind either because they are of a certain age because they live in rural or disadvantaged areas or because of some social circumstance as we say outside of disability itself In VOX we welcome the will of consensus that all parties have expressed on an issue that should not be faced and that largely responds to the demands expressed by civil society We are hearing the messages from all parties in this House and indeed they all say they are in favour of inclusion and of removing to the extent possible the physical or moral barriers that hinder the free development of personality Who can disagree with this But I have to remind you that all of you I insist all of you agree on one issue All of you agree to help people with disabilities except that they are in the mother 's womb because then all of you are willing to apply the death penalty to them for the simple fact of being in the mother 's womb We must also denounce the fact that in the process of this initiative there has been a real boycott of VOX 's proposals with the undisguised desire to exclude our participation in this legislative process But yes we have been warned as active and passive that we had to join the consensus the consensus of all of you in order to guarantee this initiative a perfect example of hypocrisy and sectarianism which unfortunately abound in this House We would have liked to have accepted some of the proposals made by the VOX Parliamentary Group but here we have heard from this rostrum this morning Mr Ramos Esteban say that VOX must be silenced Look ladies and gentlemen in case you have n't heard VOX as bad as it is for all of you is today the third political force and continues to rise so the sooner you assume it the better it will be for everyone With our proposals we tried to improve expressions that pay the toll corresponding to the connoisseurs ideological delusions of the parties progress which are all you It may give them the same but we believe it is important to avoid redundancy and subject language to the rules of linguistic correction that the Royal Spanish Academy marks Focusing already on a more substantial point of view and talking about issues that should really also be of concern to you we understand that many of the specific measures imposed on both public and private sector companies can be excessively burdensome We cannot forget the context of a serious energy and economic crisis that is going through all our productive sectors Therefore incentives and financial aid should have been provided to make it possible for entities to comply with legal requirements For the same reason it would also have been appropriate to revise the sanctioning regime provided for in Title III of the consolidated text We also believe that a procedure should have been allowed to grant aid to local authorities given their limited financial margin to meet the economic requirements arising from compliance with the accessibility rules and their proper coordination with the rest of the territorial administrations Ladies and gentlemen I am convinced that there is not a single company that does not agree with improving cognitive accessibility for people who need it but it cannot be legislated in abstract form without taking into account the sociological reality in which we have to apply the rule Because ladies and gentlemen no one with common sense can understand that an Equality Minister is going to spend EUR 20 319 million on gender policies in what you call equality policies And meanwhile the Spanish families are still stifled by the serious crisis we are experiencing Let 's see what equality you 're talking about Ladies and gentlemen VOX is a serious party and we are aware of our responsibility so we are going to face the challenge of cognitive accessibility without incurring party considerations always thinking about the best for society as a whole That is why I do not want to end without remembering once again that VOX is the only party that defends the dignity of all people regardless of their capacities within and outside the mother 's womb The main right of people is the right to life and in this as in so many other issues let me tell you that there is only VOX left
Thank you Mr. President Look Mr. Member the one you possibly write and do n't read is you I 've been reading my whole life because of my profession as a lawyer for a public administration and a public official And I can tell you that the whole amendment has nothing that can be reprehensible in the sense that you have said leading us to call us xenophobes and I do n't know what else that I do n't know what it has to do with the subject of the Navarro convention Here what is involved is the real inequality that exists There are autonomous communities that are subject to a common system in which it is the State that dictates the limits in both assigned and own taxes that is how far they can go and there are two autonomys that have their own system in which there is opacity We do not know how the Basque quota is calculated and we do not know how the Navarra contribution is calculated When the minister was a finance adviser to the Junta de Andalucia she told Mr Montoro that it produced inequality and that there could not be that opacity in the calculation of the Basque quota and the Navarra contribution Of course it is very easy when you are in an autonomy where you are seeing that there are inequalities to ask the minister of duty that there be no inequalities and just when the next year they appoint her minister to say that they will fix it because they will do everything with transparency And he insisted on transparency He said Let 's be transparent everyone will know how to calculate the Basque quota and the Navarra contribution Have any members of this House been informed of how the Basque quota is calculated since the amendment of the law was approved in December Or have any members of this House when today we are discussing the amendment of the Law of the Economic Agreement with Navarre been informed of how the Navarra contribution is calculated There 's no one here to find out I do not know where the transparency which this Government presumes is by the way the Government which as I said before is the most opaque in the history of democracy with more than one thousand two hundred resolutions unanswered by the Transparency and Good Government Council I do n't know what they 're bragging about And we have tabled the amendment as a whole and we have opposed direct and single reading because the debate in this Parliament is being stolen once again because nothing prevents it from being handled by ordinary procedure The Constitutional Court has upheld that it is treated in this way it has endorsed it but it does not prevent it from being treated by ordinary procedure And it is not a receipt that we do not have any information that we are presented the text of the bill as all documentation When you ask about those formulas that come to the end of the text on the calculation of the contribution to know on what basis and where they have the economic reports that endorse it you laugh at us and do n't give them to us And when we ask in writing they send us to the ministry 's website to the transparency portal and there 's nothing there 's nothing Where is Mrs Montero that of Andalusia who claimed that transparency
Yes President it 's over Your Honor I have given you clear examples of the privileges of the Foral Community of Navarre and I have cited the articles where they come from So do n't say we made things up And by the way there 's nothing xenophobic about it Thank you very much
With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen Madam Minister first of all I would like to thank you for coming to this House and also for the explanations you have given us regarding Section 22 Territorial Policy We said last year that his ministry was deflated he was stripped of the powers of public administration public governance public service and everything related to transparency and good governance and he was left with the powers that he did not have many years ago of general direction of territorial policy coordination They really only have powers of proposal and execution in this field and of relations with autonomous communities and local entities Therefore within this ruin budget your budget section has virtually nothing to do with anything It is not an investor budget almost everything is chapter 1 staff expenditure and current expenditure and as a novelty what has explained to us from the plan for Ceuta and Melilla but where you say 700 million in the budget only 21.5 million are collected I do n't know where they got the 700 million Oh well to several years as you have planned In the 2023 budget I have just checked 21.5 million come not 700 which is different very different Otherwise it 's more of the same They keep the 6 million euros for friends of government delegates which is the third year I 've been reporting it because it 's a scandal a shame As little has appeared this year in this Congress I will tell you the news My parliamentary group tabled a non-legislative proposal to regulate the maximum number of advisers in government delegations without limit we left it open and therefore let them set a maximum number His Government opposed and the majority of Frankenstein who supported him dropped the non-law proposal In view of this we present another non-law proposal in this case so that at least the twenty one friends of the delegate of the Government of Andalusia were reduced because it is a shame moreover they are not known They are not known at the headquarters of the Delegation of the Government of Andalusia The Socialist spokesman on the Commission told us it is that eight provinces and there are seven sub- delegations plus the delegation and therefore they touch less than three per province And it gave us the impression that they were in the sub delegations which would be a fraud of law because the current legislation prohibits sub- delegates from having advisers Then if they 're using government delegates they 're in law fraud But of course why does Castilla and León which has nine provinces one more have only five advisers They play half advisor by province Then the argument I do n't know falls by its own weight That non-legislative proposal was also not successful and then we said that they would carry out a study of the workloads of government delegations and new job and function relationships that might be done by staff We told them that it might have to be determined that it had to be made by career staff And we did not object to the opening of the coverage of those posts for free appointment so that when another delegate of the Government was able to Caesar and appoint another career official in accordance with the legally established procedure Nor have they done anything they have neither studied nor changed the employment relationship You guys look very comfortable with your chiringuito A year ago from this very rostrum I told him that I gave up giving me the resumes of others but that I gave the twenty one of Andalusia Not only has he not given them to me but he is failing to comply with a final judgment of the Supreme Court which is very serious Because my group has taken them to the courts and the Supreme Court has handed down a final judgment that obliges them to hand over the curricula we had requested They started sending them to them and when they had already sent us the third package which was that of Catalonia someone ordered in the ministry that no more packages of government delegations will be sent to us And if you do n't know it from this moment on you 'll find out because you 're going to do a year of the sentence in March and at the end of January as you have n't fulfilled we 're going to demand responsibilities I 'm not going to bitteren the turret and I 'm going to let Christmas and Kings pass but at the end of January we have responsibilities We all know that the autocrat laughs at the separation of powers but then he washes his hands and leaves them lying down and the person directly responsible for the non-compliance will be you and as they disable it for non-compliance I do n't know what they 're going to do Finally I say to him that at the end of January we demanded responsibilities for non-compliance with a final judgment of the Supreme Court You ask citizens to comply with sentences for example because it is the worst thing that a ministry does not comply with a final ruling of the Supreme Court My group is concerned about the drift of this Government which is endangering the unity of Spain by the handovers to the blackmails of the separatists the coups the billionaires And actually it 's a shame because what did n't get the ETA with 857 murders is getting it now for Mr. Sanchez 's assignments That is tremendous and causes much damage to the unity of the homeland and to the unity of all Spaniards It 's going to take many years in that fracture that you 're causing I conclude because the President is going to take the floor You said earlier that these budgets are the antidote to the war in Ukraine I do n't know what your budget section has to do with the war in Ukraine but good For us it is the budgets of ruin and again it is believed that this government is more concerned about the welfare of politicians and their friends than about the well being of all Spaniards Thank you very much
With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to say that my parliamentary group the VOX Group is in favour of the evaluation of public policies provided that its purpose is to analyse and highlight the impact of such policies on issues as crucial for citizenship as the unity of Spain and national sovereignty territorial cohesion and equality between Spaniards the environment and rural Spain the protection of the socio- economically disadvantaged depopulation and the demographic challenge economic growth decent stable and quality employment intergenerational solidarity and the just redistribution of wealth among others while respecting the legal and constitutional order of our nation What we do not agree with is that it should be done in the proposed way creating three new bodies the State Agency for the Evaluation of Public Policies the Higher Evaluation Commission and the General Evaluation Council At present the Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policies already exists in Spain and in our view it is not justified from the perspective of reducing public expenditure efficiency and budgetary balance that what is now an agency is divided into three In parliamentary technique the law is very bad it is very poorly structured and very poorly drafted and it gives the impression that it has been drafted by the gentleman to whom they are going to entrust the management of that agency As I was saying there is now an institute and of course that of being a director of the same institute sounded bad to him and they said let 's put state agency which sounds nicer to be director of a state agency because it does n't make any sense Where appropriate what should be done was to provide the current institute with the necessary resources and to expand or strengthen its powers Currently the Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policy has the following functions which coincide with what is contained in the draft law but are divided into three agencies evaluation of public policies plans and programmes in coordination with ministerial departments promotion of the culture of public policy evaluation preparation dissemination and publication of reports technical documents and other documents of interest and methodologies and evaluation guides training in public policy evaluation and in particular training of public employees in this area in coordination with INAP the instrumental support necessary to carry out the analyses required by the modernization or planning processes that are being promoted and participation in agencies organizations and forums related to the evaluation of public policies with collaborative options Of course it does not contain anything that this should be done with a gender perspective and based on the dogmas of the 2030 Agency which is what you like and then you decide that we need to change it On the other hand the definition made by the current Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policies of the activity and purposes of the evaluation of public policies is also consistent with what is contained in the draft law First the current institute defines the evaluation of public policies as the systematic and reasoned process of knowledge generation from the collection analysis and interpretation of information aimed at the overall understanding of a public intervention whether it be a policy plan program or norm to achieve an evidence based value judgement regarding its design implementation and effects It is literal as it comes in the bill Secondly with regard to the purposes of the evaluation the institute stresses as the draft law also does that the evaluation promotes transparency and accountability of citizens and contributes to the improvement of democratic quality assists in evidence based decision making promotes effectiveness and efficiency in public action by promoting greater rationality of public expenditure serves learning and contributes to the improvement of the strategic and operational dimension of public action and encourages participation in public action In our opinion this bill is one more example of the socialcommunist legislation which loves to create chiringuitos to act as a agency for the placement of friends of the government and hence creates agency commission and advice to place three directors general deputy directors general friends We see no point in it and that is why we have tabled a total of 30 amendments which respond to these four proposals First to make ex ante intermediate and ex post evaluations mandatory for all public policies and to link them to the expenditure monitoring activity of the AIReF Secondly change the criteria of public value final objectives and indicators that will determine the evaluation of public policies and define them in a closed and objective way to avoid their instrumentalization in the service of left wing ideologies and globalist agendas Thirdly to abolish new equipment units or bodies as I said before nothing less than three which is covered by the bill And fourthly to reduce the periodicity of public policy assessment plans that are required of the Government and ministerial departments Well none of our 30 amendments have been accepted in the Commission so we are keeping them alive and we are going to put them to your consideration Mr. President I conclude Once again it is shown that this Government is thinking of the welfare of politicians rather than the welfare of citizens Nothing more and thank you very much
With the coming of the presidency Ladies and gentlemen as Mr Mazón rightly points out in his motion the relevance of the Solvay Chemical industrial complex in Torrelavega which makes it a key agent within the productive fabric of Cantabria is well known Mr. Mazón also pointed out in his speech that Solvay has designed the start up of an energy production plant from alternative fuels which will replace the current coal Well what Mr Masones does not explain is that the Cantabria government had this project on the table more than three years ago that it lost the cart of the European decarbonisation funds which other companies were able to benefit from and that it took more than two years to process the file and get all the reports required by Cantabria 's regulations for these procedures Of course it is curious because the Cantabria government demands too many reports I remember to see how they act a director general who when he had been a director for a year and a half said to his officials I have been a year and a half and you have never prepared a decree or rule for me to take to the Governing Council and regulate something And they asked What do you want us to do Whatever may be within our competence and above all one thing that we have to issue a mandatory report on something he replied That is the level that is what is in the Community of Cantabria and Mr. Mazón knows him who has been a counselor just like me It turns out that a company arrived it has passed very recently barely three years ago Santander Coated Solutions to create eight hundred jobs already had the land and had spent a million euros to rotate because when it had been waiting two years for it to finish informing the last general address that it had to do it went to León and in three months it built instead of Santander Quoted Solution León Quoted Solution We have lost eight hundred jobs because the Cantabria Government does not know how to process files It has a decadent industrial fabric because they have at the head of the Industry Council a lord of the Regionalist Party who is a Latin teacher and who is more dedicated to tourism By the way in this area of tourism there are complaints from the unions which is already difficult that Workers Commissions denounced the cantabria socialist regional party that they have placed all the friends and related to the party which is known as low intensity corruption Well that 's the regional socialist party in Cantabria That 's right Revilla goes on television she wants to set an example of everything of governance and so on However Mr Revilla for those who do not know presides over the Autonomous Community of Cantabria but does not govern lets do it There is a tentade there that by the way whenever there is a committee of inquiry in Parliament and they quote it it immediately says I know nothing that my adviser Just like when he was caught with the cigar on the terrace at the time that he himself had banned smoking he said I do n't smoke I do n't know anything Well unfortunately that 's the reality of Cantabria They do n't have industrial plans they do n't have plans for livestock The truth is that it is a pity this region for those who know it and those who have known it in other times because they can see how the whole Besaya area is which is precisely where the Solvay factory is located how Torrelavega is which we can describe as the capital of Besaya and which had a great trade until twenty years ago many of them better shops than those of Santander which is the capital and now it 's hard to pass there it 's all closed everything is local for rent for sale there is nothing of trade Why Because this was an industrial zone and the whole industry is abandoned paralyzed My group will always support everything that is necessary to reactivate the industry Do not think that we are the ogres who will oppose all sensible measures Everything that is necessary and enters within reasonable possibilities we will support it What we are not going to support is those measures derived from those radical ecological mantras that you have generated derived from that new climate religion Thank you very much
He has specifically said two things that I want to clarify The first who had seized my salary and the second who had been convicted of not paying the workers I would like to make it clear to you that I have never been burdened with my salary you can consult with the services of the House and that no one has condemned me for not paying some workers perhaps you are mistaken for Mr Echenique that yes you did not pay your employee you looked after him and you did not pay Social Security
Thank you for being as flexible with me as with Podemos Mr. President The future of our children ladies and gentlemen and the future of Spain we play it today and just as it is not a good idea to change mathematics for socio- affective education it is not a good idea to confuse our country 's priorities with ideological dogmas Today with these motions for resolutions we have the opportunity to reorient the priorities to address the real problems of Spain and the Spanish and to respond to national emergencies
Finished I have enormous faith in Spain we all have faith in VOX but there is a previous emergency that we have to deal with before any previous resolution which is to abandon the Pedro Sánchez government
Those who have nothing more to contribute do not bother and leave as soon as possible because it is time for Spain Thank you very much
Thank you Madam President Madam Minister the Spanish have suffered more than any other country in Europe from the economic consequences of their government in at least three ways The first in no other country have the income of families fallen as much as in Spain as it did as a result of their action Secondly in no other country has the fiscal pressure risen as it has risen in Spain the Spanish remember more and more of the four times that the Minister of Finance lied when he said here four times that they will not raise taxes And thirdly no other country has been so slow and citizens have had to see such a lack of management in support of families SMEs and self employed people Fall of income plus taxes and zero aid And in case that were not enough there is now a fourth factor which is inflation that is the rise in the price of the commodities consumed by the Spaniards Inflation is a phenomenon that you called transitory but it is consolidating at the highest rates since the twentieth century Yesterday we knew that price escalation was 6.1 This means that above the three factors with which you are making the Spaniards suffer this fourth is depriving the Spaniards of 6 of their scarce savings that is the Spaniards are 6 poorer than last year as a result of their management It 's an invisible tax it 's a way of stealing from the Spanish 6 and you remember each time you pay the bill for the light you pay the gasoline or you pay the heating I assure you that you remember a lot of you What are you going to do to fight inflation
Mrs Calviño I think things are going great for you but not as well as for the Spanish You are talking about unemployment and inflation and that this is a global problem Well look when you add the unemployment rate to the inflation rate what you get is the so called poverty rate more unemployment and there are quite intelligent economists who compare countries around the world not just the European Union and make a table of the thirty five most advanced countries in the world where they measure the poverty rate I stop more inflation You lower your head because you know who number one is on that table right It 's Spain Spain is the country that has the worst index of misery I stop more inflation To combat inflation there are other countries which have taken measures which have lowered taxes such as Poland which have withdrawn VAT etc What are you guys gonna do Increase the collection as always We will not go forward until you leave this government
"Ladies and gentlemen the world is changing the current geopolitical landscape is defined by uncertainty and strategic competition for power With the Russian invasion of Ukraine Fukuyama 's thesis on the end of history has again been refuted history has not come to an end Today more than ever Spain has to awaken and establish a budget for the Armed Forces that will enable them to carry out their mission It is often said and it is true that there is a lack of defence culture in Spain In recent decades politicians and the media have tried to redefine the role of our Armed Forces towards something like an NGO in uniform a forces always in missions called peace hiding the real dangers they assume in war zones and diminishing their ability to respond in situations of risk due to a misunderstanding of pacifism Of course our soldiers sailors and airmen will always be there to help in the face of natural or provoked disasters and of course they help to reduce tension in war zones but let us not forget their main mission enshrined in article 8 of the Constitution to guarantee the sovereignty and independence of Spain to defend its territorial integrity and the constitutional order This high mission requires sufficient budgetary resources to carry it out with full guarantees so we ask that on the eve of the NATO summit to be held in our country Spain take on the commitment made with our allies and raise up to 2 of the gross domestic product expenditure or investment in defence In absolute terms Spain devotes less than 1.1 of its gross domestic product Spain invests in defence only 258 dollars per capita a figure that contrasts with the 410 of Italy 709 of France or 781 of the United Kingdom According to the Atlantic Alliance Spain occupies the penultimate place penultimate 28 of 29 of NATO member countries in this area We only have Luxembourg behind us Ladies and gentlemen with a gross domestic product of just over EUR 1 million Spain should be investing twice as much in defence as is envisaged in the current budget thus reaching just over EUR 20 billion and being able to meet our international commitments It would be enough to invest in defence as much as we spend on gender equality policies The benefits of defence investment are multiple and generate a virtuous circle experienced in many countries Anyone who has known the world of technology tangentially will know that it owes multiple advances to the demand generated by a customer who consumes technology in a regular way such as the military industry Miniaturization space exploration electronics telecommunications satellite use mobile telephony the Internet drones research in areas such as biomedicine biology chemistry and so many others would be much poorer or perhaps there would not even exist in some cases if it were not for its defence application which would then move to the civil world Indeed investing in defense generates virtuous circles promotes technological advances and increases progress by generating wealth Within the necessary increase in the defence budget we have to start with a better remuneration for our troops and that is what the VOX Parliamentary Group is trying to correct today with this initiative a proposal for a law that establishes a single professional regime for professional military personnel that settles a debt of justice with those who dedicate the best years of their lives precisely to ensuring our own and that shields our commitment to national defence in the only way possible with the sufficient financial resources recorded annually in the general budgets of the State Ladies and gentlemen the excessive temporality of the Armed Forces is not explained by itself it is a problem caused by politicians With all due respect ladies and gentlemen of the PSOE and the PP you have abandoned them Twenty six years have passed since the beginning of the process of professionalization of the Armed Forces and twenty one years since the end of compulsory military service Since then our soldiers have been condemned to an absolutely unfair job insecurity low wages much lower than those of the countries in our environment and far below the rest of the administration 's workers systematic indebtedness and the chaining of temporary contracts and early exit from work until they are dispensed with without just an alternative Ladies and gentlemen for a duty of gratitude for justice but also for efficiency we must turn the military career into an attractive option for our young people I take this opportunity to greet the Union Association of Troop Military UMT which is accompanying us today in the Chamber Our national defense requires that we establish a system aimed at attracting cultivating and retaining talent throughout a professional life We played a lot on it That is why VOX registered in October 2020 a proposal regarding the salary matching of the Armed Forces with State security forces and bodies In the words of an ancient JEMAD that a combat pilot wins at least the same as the civilian guard who guards access to the base That VOX initiative succeeded in passing this House but unfortunately it has not been carried out and that is why today we are presenting this bill which if it goes ahead would put an end to the unjust situation of precariousness suffered by our soldiers Ladies and gentlemen throughout the public administration the general administration of the state autonomous communities and local authorities there is no single case of two different laws regulating the same profession This is precisely what is happening today with our Armed Forces On the one hand there are officers and all non-commissioned officers career soldiers with a stable and permanent service relationship and on the other hand the troop scale subject to the renewal of their commitment to the limit initially set at 35 years of age and extended thereafter to 45 years By reaching that age the military who have dedicated the best years of their life to Spain are no longer serving are no longer worth it They are soldiers who have served with pride Many have family burdens are fully trained and have extensive experience but at a time of their career as important as this an absurd bureaucratic design decree that no longer has to take into account their professional value They are not worth we are told and at the same time they are offered to be integrated into a reserve of special availability in exchange for their and their families complying with a grant of just over 600 euros 640 to be precise And the Ministry of Defence is resorting to temporary contracts to cover basic and ordinary needs of our Armed Forces and that is an unacceptable abuse that cannot be supported on budgetary grounds The abulia shown by governments of different signs in recent years towards our Armed Forces has a dire consequence if no one remedys it 53,000 military personnel sadly will go on to thicken the queues of unemployment Ladies and gentlemen the problem of age in the Armed Forces is not new and we are very aware that it is not an easy problem either It is well known that military life is necessarily shorter than ordinary work even for the cadres of command Not in vain the licensing of veterans has historically been the main problem of professional armies It is therefore appropriate to encourage a certain voluntary drainage of the contingent to help maintain a reasonable average age for service in units but it is also necessary to find ways to retain those who while serving satisfactorily wish to remain in positions destinations and conditions of service more suitable for their age preparation and experience Unfortunately this has not been done Conversely the system has made temporality an essential intrinsic almost structural feature of the defence model In the face of the foolishness of 35 year old graduates the PSOE government thought so let 's postpone ten years kick forward and let 's leave it in 45 But that only meant postponing ten years more the effects of a staff regime that was simply ill founded Therefore the present proposal for a law is intended to repeal Law 8/2006 and establish a common regime for the categories official non-official troop and navy with the criterion that the service relationship of all professional military personnel is substantially the same and is regulated by the same law For the entrance of soldiers and sailors is established a single temporary commitment of three years a stage of training and professional practice aimed at obtaining the title of middle level technician through a methodology of dual vocational training Upon completion of the conditions a permanent service relationship identical to that of the command tables would be accessed Ladies and gentlemen let 's do this We cannot deny the financial cost that the alternative we present today entails but it is a duty of justice it is a duty of gratitude to those who play their lives for us and above all it represents an imperative necessity We have armed forces that enjoy enormous internationally endorsed prestige and forged mission to mission worldwide That is why we need to adopt this bill today but it is despite and not because of the budgetary effort to provide them with the means they deserve For too long too much the lack of means has condemned our military to have to carry out their activities in a precarious way and that is a threat to their life and to ours Serving Spain honoring it defending it with one 's own life if necessary is the vocation of those who voluntarily decide to join our Armed Forces They carry out a great public service a service that transcends them and with it they guarantee to their compatriots peace security and ultimately freedom The Spaniards owe them a lot Many of them more than a hundred in recent years have even given their lives for Spain and for all of us We remember them every year on the Day of Hispanicity and in castrense acts For the country to die was their destiny to love Spain their eternal passion to serve in the armies their vocation and otherwise They did n't want to serve another Flag they did n't want to walk another way they did n't know how to die otherwise Ladies and gentlemen we can treat them differently and it is the best tribute that we can offer to our military from this House Thank you very much"
Thank you Madam President Madam Minister the first thing is to ask her to send a lot of memories to the Minister for Economic Affairs who has been absent from this monitoring session today It is a pity that he does not accompany us this week in which so many Spaniards feel so close almost as if he were part of the family or if not of the family at least as if he were part of the national heritage But in view of the fact that the Minister of Economy is not present we move on to the Finance Minister and the temptation is to ask you if you are going to raise taxes again but it would be a vain temptation because I have already asked you that question four times and in the four you have failed the truth We all remember that this government is not going to raise taxes either to the middle class or to the working class And since then the Spanish middle classes have suffered as in no other developed country not only because of the disastrous economic management that has left us behind in the recovery not only because of inflation which has impoverished the Spanish as never in the last forty years but also because your Government you Minister has raised the fiscal pressure in Spain to unsustainable levels and leading the increase in taxation in the developed countries We will not recover the economic level of 2019 until at least 2024 but according to its own Tax Agency we already pay 26 more taxes than before the pandemic Do you believe that the Spaniards can continue to endure the fiscal expoliation of this government
Your Honor I do not want to disappoint you but if inflation rises by 10 one month the next month is 6 it means that prices continue to rise You understand that do n't you Do you understand this Prices continue to rise over the previous year Then she explains it to the Minister of Economy But the reality Minister of Finance is that you have raised companies VAT IRPF assets estates donations registration tax that of real estate through a historical review of the cadastre The truth is that you have introduced the Tobin rate the Google rate taxes on plastic waste air conditioning The truth is that you have penalized savings by reducing the deductions applicable to pension schemes What is certain is that the biggest tax increase the biggest tax effort in this country has fallen on whom do you know Not about the rich as you like to say but using your words about the middle class and the working class the same ones you have abandoned and the same ones minister who are abandoning you because you have been a deception for all of Spain but especially for your voters and especially for the middle and working classes of this country
"Thank you Madam President Mrs Calviño a recommendation listen to Mr Rufián Listen to Mr. Rufián when he says that the left has completely abandoned the workers just as he has completely abandoned his independence ideology Listen to me before I 'm fired for ideological absenteeism as he was fired from his only job for work absenteeism You have caused Europe 's greatest job destruction but you are still with the government of the twenty two ministers and with the official positions intended to be the nanny of one of them The Spaniards can't fill the deposit but you continue with your brand new official cars The Spaniards do n't have one of the aids let alone the ones that need them most but you allocate 335,000 euros to renew Mr Sánchez 's summer palace Thousands of SMEs self employed merchants and hoteliers have stayed out of the distribution of European funds but you give them to your IBEX friends who will then agree on their advice when they leave the government You have broken equality between Spaniards giving priority to those politicians who govern regions that are the least loyal to Spain and punishing those who have precisely been most loyal to Spain And now when the prices of energy food and commodities are in the clouds you are announcing new tax increases and giving 17 million euros to the unions precisely to say that now we have to lower them Minister for your government there are first and second Spaniards among those second the Spanish on foot by the way many of them voting for you Minister why are you and your entire government doing an economic policy that increases the inequality of the Spaniards"
Mrs Calviño for your government the only equality there is is that everyone who criticizes you is treated equally badly So far in what you called ultra right there was only VOX left but it 's now ultra right everyone If the transporters are on strike the minister also calls them ultra-right those who manifest themselves in the streets livestock farmers hunters fishermen all of them ultra- right taxi drivers traders hoteliers self employed gardeners waiters pharmacists all who complain are ultra-right I imagine the dependents of the overseas stores will be ultra right for you But do you know what the problem is That you 're deaf that you 're not listening to the street minister that people are having a really bad time out there Madam Vice President you are not knowing Of course vulnerable people who suffer the most are having a very bad time but also middle and working classes those who have been taxed after denying it four times are suffering a lot We wo n't move forward Minister until we leave you behind
"Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen the political course begins and it does so in the midst of extremely worrying circumstances After almost two and a half years since the arrival of the coronavirus in Spain our economy remains the only one in the European Union that has not yet recovered the levels of gross domestic product prior to the pandemic As we note the Government 's growth forecasts are once again a wet paper but some prestigious institutions go beyond that AIReF anticipates a downturn in the economy in this third quarter which would be the first contraction in that quarter in nine years The productive fabric very weakened has had to make real heroes to survive and is resenting it The latest data on unemployment and membership recorded the first destruction of employment in a month of July throughout the historical series and when there are still 38,000 companies less than before the crisis the Government brings us a real decree law that not only does it not bravely face the problems we suffer but it again carries on the shoulders of the SMEs the self employed the traders and the Spanish families what they are unable to solve Ladies and gentlemen in these circumstances once again the Government brings us an order and command a new real cheating decree- law with very different provisions affecting a plurality of matters with improvised measures some even going to increase inflation further and which of course have not negotiated with anyone and which do not solve what remains one of the main structural problems affecting our country From the producers of the largest confinement of the West unconstitutional by the way according to the Constitutional Court at the request of VOX from the writers of the idea of getting up in the morning to put the washing machine and save on the light bill now comes a new chapter the cut of the air conditioning in summer and the restrictions to the heating in winter the blackout of the windows and the rejoining of the merchants who want listen to this to force to install automatic closing doors in all the shops of Spain before 30 September a real madness And the Spaniards are sick of so much madness because it is now the Spanish households our companies and the productivity of the whole country that are paying for the consequences of an unsettled energy policy driven for decades by governments of the PSOE the PP and its European partners Those political elites installed in their climate dogmas that are now calling for these efforts are the same ones that have caused the problem precisely with these dogmas accentuated above with the situation that they have created of dependence on Russian energy The Spanish deserve a government that promotes an energy sovereignty plan that increases the diversification of energy supply sources ensures cheap sustainable efficient and clean energy and puts Spain and the Spanish at the centre of interest On the other hand you show that you have not learned anything from the situation you have created and worst of all reoccur in error with the usual measures Instead of advocating a realistic adaptation of climate objectives instead of betting as it is starting to be done in other countries for nuclear energy said the other day the president of the Spanish Nuclear Society that Spain is the only country in the European Union that is not revising or even considering revising its programme to extend the life of its reactors and instead of opening up ways for the exploitation of its own resources you opt for the only way you know to impose consumption cuts whose impact on Russia will be zero Moreover now that six months have passed since the invasion of Ukraine Russia is entering 89 more than before for the export of hydrocarbons to European countries and that is what we are selling 15 less volume that is Europe pays more and receives less gas Meanwhile you all pass a climate change law that prohibits us from exploiting the natural resources we have For those of us who defend common sense at the time and alone the penalty was to call ourselves anti-European or climate negatists But you know that we do n't care about that we do n't care what you call us What has already been shown and faster than we thought ourselves is that as always VOX was right It is not that the number of people you call denialists is going to grow but that more and more Spaniards are going to refuse to vote for you and you who have created this situation for you If that were not enough the Government Minister has been able to further worsen the situation in the midst of an energy war generating a diplomatic conflict with one of our main gas suppliers Algeria which precisely made us less dependent on Russia Ladies and gentlemen it is not serious to fire Russian gas purchases until you are able to turn Russia into Spain 's second largest gas supplier while you say you are defending the opposite And knowing that it is not serious to state as the explanatory statement of this royal decree law makes that Spain has a low dependence on Russian gas It is not serious to say that we are less dependent on that gas and at the same time suffer the biggest blackouts in Europe It is not serious to approve aid to transporters who need it while preparing a tax via tolls It is not serious to demand efforts from the Spanish while the president of the Government of the twenty two ministries continues to burn fuel in his Falcon for absurd journeys Ladies and gentlemen a very complicated very complicated winter is coming economic confidence is crumbling growth is slowing down and the prices of the shopping basket are already in the clouds The Spaniards already spend a month and a half a year just to pay that price increase making saving impossible The destruction of jobs comes back and the feared ERTEs arrive after the ban on firing activated by the pandemic has expired The rise in interest rates which we announce would arrive is already here and time is running out Ladies and gentlemen it is not as you always say Putin the virus and Franco This is the incompetence of a government that must have taken the initiative a long time ago but offers only increases in taxes patches occurrences and improvisations such as those that today lead us to validate Do not count on us we will not be collaborators of the greatest destruction of the Spanish economy in the last forty years This disaster that you have brought will be the one that will put an end to this very government Spain cannot wait and the first station is that you call elections and leave the government as soon as possible for the good of Spain Thank you very much"
With regard to Rule 72 I would like it to be established in this House for the future if the extreme right extreme right and fascist terms are accepted or not mentioned as I understand they are mentioned to the group in this House which considers them extremely aggressive which is the VOX Parliamentary Group I want to make it clear from here to the future whether these terms are tolerated or not
Thank you Mr. President Madam Vice President I understand that there are people who find it difficult to understand the out of game but I do not understand that there are people who find it difficult to understand the classification of a table I say this because last week I tried to explain a basic concept and you come and repeat exactly the same thing to tell us about the solidity and growth of the Spanish economy If you had sunk the Spanish economy 50 and the following year had grown another 50 we would be 25 below It 's just that you understand this until the man who roasted the butter Do n't go on with the same thing The data we knew last week confirm that Spain 's GDP in the second quarter of the year the last one we have is 2.2 below the pre-pandemic level Minister Do not try to deceive either this House or the Spanish All countries in the eurozone have regained their level of gross domestic product minus Spain all of them That means that we are the last in line minister that is understood by everyone Clearly the instability of this government the permanent shambles of its components the vavenes that you are giving are the causes of this crisis Otherwise why is Spain the only country in the eurozone that has not yet regained the pre-crisis level
You tell us Your Honor that we mention the war of Putin No it is you who welcome a triangle which is Franco and the far right the virus and Putin always the same The Putin War I say will affect everyone or will it affect only Spain which is the country that is together with Portugal further away from Ukraine Will it be that if it affects everyone and we go the last something has done wrong this government Minister for something that is going on will be your responsibility It is that there are two very serious problems here that have to do with this Government First ideology You are an ideologically radical economic vice president and that is no longer being carried anywhere Minister And second internal division and permanent changes Then you talk about the crises of others They have been feeding that this parliamentary group is in crisis for two weeks because it has been a person but in the last four years the only spokesman for this parliamentary group has been me and at this time I have already been through three spokesmen of the Socialist Parliamentary Group three spokesmen of the Government three foreign ministers three justice ministers three university ministers four ministers of culture and five vice presidents of the Government Your Honor including you And without forgetting that you have been vice president third who went to second and went up first while you are lowering the Spanish economy from first division to second and will send us to third You 're a mess but there 's hope and it's that you 're going to leave very soon This is going to happen way before what you think You can leave voluntarily or if you wo n't be voting very soon because fortunately in Spain as in Europe it is time for patriots
Thank you Madam President Madam Vice President olive oil in Spain today has risen by 30 flour by 20 baby food by 11 fruit milk rice by 10 eggs bread vegetables fruit beef by 7 In Pedro Sánchez 's Spain subsidies are raised not to the Spaniards who may need them but to the Federation of Progressive Women to the Association of Free and Combative Women to the Association Arcoiris In real Spain petrol is 2 euros per litre In Spain Pedro Sánchez 's 40 increase is due to the fact that his advisers are already 1200 with a cost for the period of 65 million euros In real Spain energy the cost of light is 450 euros megawatt hour 800 more than just a year ago In Spain Pedro Sánchez draws money from the savings of the Spanish to give them to the trade unions 17 million euros more than twice as much as before the pandemic because at the home of the communist minister they taught him that the unions must be fattened so that they do not protest on the street and so they make a box of resistance to be able to burn the streets when we govern just as the communist minister recently threatened us with its typically totalitarian and undemocratic style In real Spain there is an unemployment rate of 13.3 30 for young people excluding ERTE In Spain of Pedro Sánchez there are 21 billion euros for cross-cutting feminist policies and a new fiscal rise to the middle and working class of which the Minister of Finance always denies Minister you 've got me confused really What are those moderate economic policies that in your opinion the Government is developing
Madam Vice President although it is hard for you and your parliamentary group to believe this because they live in a bubble there is life beyond the chiringuitos you mention the chiringuitos of feminists the LGTB chiringuitos and the subsidized chiringuitos like the unions which are the largest chiringuito in Spain But that 's not what I 'm saying they 're going to say it more and more Spanish This Saturday thousands of people go out to the street against rising prices On Sunday thousands of Spaniards go out again for their attacks on the primary sector on our countryside on our livestock on our farmers on Pedro Sánchez 's attacks on the lifestyle of so many Spaniards And the Spaniards take the street not because they are mobilized by their subsidized unions no but because they are tolerant and patient and understanding but they are not idiots and when they themselves wonder where they were four years ago and where they are today and if they are better today than four years ago it is very clear that they are much worse And no it 's neither Franco nor the virus nor Putin it 's Pedro Sánchez
Thank you Madam President Minister the year is over and it's a good time to assess how we 're doing Judging by the tone that you bring today and that you brought in the president a moment ago surely we agree because the reality is very simple you want us to talk about economy the reality is that Spain is still the only country in Europe that has not yet regained the pre-crisis level We remain the country of Europe with the most unemployment we remain a country in which the deficit accumulates year by year in the form of public debt that is growing to unsustainable rates and that you are going to transfer our grandchildren and we continue to have the Spaniards with an inflation that impoverishes them month by month Anyone would say things are pretty bad But it is also true that they are not bad for everyone that is true A few weeks ago I said that there is no one in Spain who has prospered with your Government and you told me about the people who access public education public health that people receive certain subsidies as if that were to prosper I am surprised that for you that is to prosper because that may be to survive but to prosper is to ostensibly improve one 's personal situation especially in economic terms But then you told me something very celebrated by your bench you recommended me to change friends and I want to tell you that now I understand what you want to say You mean that in order to prosper that is to improve one 's economic situation what needs to be done is to be friends with this government And I have to give you reason because it is true that in Spain precisely those who are close to the government are prospering friends party partners family members There are some who have prospered a lot especially those who are close to you Minister So from the privileged watchman who gives him his position what opinion does the evolution of the Spanish economy deserve in this 2020
Madam Minister I think that in these months we have already talked a lot about how it is a falsehood to say that the Spanish economy is growing a lot in the sense that that is a good indicator because we come from far behind and as far as we grow we are still the only European economy that has not been put at the 2019 level see if it is serious I mean with you Spaniards are worse than when they arrived that 's simple But not all of them indeed Not only their family members not only their party partners in Spain have also prospered a great deal the seditious the thugs the floot terrorists the pederasts the sexual aggressors the rapists These are the only ones that have prospered in Pedro Sánchez 's Spain in 2022
"Thank you Madam President Madam Vice President it has been at the forefront of this government 's economic policy for almost four years now and you have made a mistake in each and every one of the macro forecasts you have been making It was you who said that the epidemic would have an unsignificant and transitory impact It was you who claimed that the recovery would be in the form of grapes which predicted last year that Spain would grow by 9.8 when it really grew by half by 5 The question is whether you believe the government 's economic forecasts are reliable But before I answer and since you 're talking about the truth I remind you that in last week 's question you answered me one falsehood after another up to nine Look let 's tell lies One He told me the Government 's response to the pandemic has been effective The truth is that according to the University of Cambridge Spain was the worst country to manage it Two He stated that the Government has been effective in protecting companies The reality is that today there are 78,000 companies missing that existed before the crisis Three You argued that we managed to maintain employment and the truth is that we are the country that has destroyed the most employment in Europe Four You said that the measures were effective in protecting the incomes of families The data show that the largest drop in income of households on the continent has occurred in Spain Five You told us about a strong recovery forgetting that we are the only country in the European Union and I dare say from the West that you have not yet recovered the level of gross domestic product prior to the pandemic Six You spoke of an extraordinary labour market when two years later we have not recovered effective employment in the private sector and we continue to lead Europe 's unemployment The lack of employment that has been created has been in the public sector That 's cheating on the solitaire Minister You are It came to us to say this is already of northern aurora that you are lowering taxes when you have not left a tax behind Eight You hid yourself talking about inflation in the context of global evolution as if the government had nothing to do with what is happening in Spain and it is that we are ending the year 2021 with the highest inflation rate of the major euro economies Nine He argued that energy policy would allow us to have cheaper energy when what he has done has been to put us all at the highest prices in history Nine lies in a minute and thirteen seconds minister a mark of reach of very few Almost no one can believe them anymore"
Ladies and gentlemen in your case progressives are to progress what portfoliors are to portfolio you are the worst economic disaster that Spain has experienced since the Civil War You can fool some people some time but as Lincoln said you can't fool all people all the time The Spaniards know perfectly well what economic situation they are in The Spanish know that we have not yet recovered even the pre-pandemic levels The Spaniards know we 're not going to get ahead until we tackle this
"Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen just two years ago the government of Pedro Sánchez came to this House to ask for a blank cheque for its budgetary policy The gravity of the epidemic the imperative need to give an extraordinary response to an extraordinary situation and the difficulty of making realistic predictions could apparently justify the suspension of fiscal rules but the background irresponsibility and budgetary indiscipline of this Government were to relax the control that this House has an obligation to carry out to the Executive Once again there was only VOX left We then refuse to be complicit in an uncontrolled increase in spending that would put us in a situation of extreme vulnerability without framing it into a budgetary rebalancing plan that would ensure the sustainability of public accounts Minister it is required by law but for two years it has not complied with the legal obligation set out in section 11.3 of the Budget Stability and Financial Sustainability Act I remember him because he says not with his head That law expressly states Minister that the temporary deviation of the public deficit cannot endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term and moreover that in cases of extraordinary deviation must be accompanied by a rebalancing plan and that such a plan must be referred within a maximum period of one month from the date on which the non-compliance is found or the circumstances justifying it are assessed I remember it because the Banco de España and the AIReF remind you of it every time they get a chance Last time only 15 days ago Humbly we have also been claiming the VOX Parliamentary Group through numerous initiatives for more than two years and today we are claiming it again The health of public accounts is one of the foundations of a country 's credibility which you have laminated Socialist ladies and gentlemen when you have no explanation for something you always welcome the same magic triangle virus Putin Franco They have not yet had the boldness to bring us to Franco on this occasion but in these years of extreme suffering for Spanish society we always have a constant the consolidation of superfluous public spending and the failure of the objectives that justified the extraordinary suspension of fiscal rules saving companies saving jobs and being next to the Spaniards who most needed it Let us not forget that in these years the Government of the twenty two ministries has consolidated and increased political spending as never before seen in Spain In the worst moments of our history it is when we have had the government that has spent most of our history Never has a Government held higher positions advisors and trusted staff and while companies were struggling to survive while families tightened their belts they were raising salaries There has been a 56 increase in union departures they have renewed the fleet of official cars they have more than doubled the expenditure for official advertising and advertising they have saved Chavista airlines they have fired the expenditure on feminist bars and fed ideological guilders Ladies and gentlemen the suspension of the tax rules triggered the public deficit and placed the debt in historical terms but it did not at all prevent the biggest increase in poverty in the euro area the irreversible damage that has been caused to the productive fabric and that Spain has been released in recovery We are the latest in the table of the European Economic Evolution League 2019 2022 And it turns out that now without ERTE without extraordinary expenditure of unemployment benefits without the presence of automatic stabilisers to justify it they present us with a ceiling of expenditure of EUR 2 billion higher than that of that extraordinary moment and they give every correction of the deficit to the increase of collection largely derived from inflation and also derived from all the taxes that the Minister of Finance has denied me four times that they were going to carry out to the most suffered Spaniards Another twist of the irresponsible reckless and openly damaging budget policy which two and a half years after the pandemic makes recovery enormously difficult and which will unfortunately leave very difficult scars to heal Minister we 've been warning you for three years and unfortunately the time has come After the July rise on 8 September the Council of the European Central Bank decided to raise interest rates in the euro area by 75 basis points the greatest increase in its history and Spain unfortunately will start paying and much for the interest of the debt and the rise of the rates catches us without the duties done The imbalance in public accounts is already structural not cyclical and the AIReF warns you that with these policies public debt could reach 140 of gross domestic product The structural reforms have been abandoned and not only that is that today in Spain the education system or the framework of work or the sustainability of pensions are worse than two years ago not better and the only solution you propose is to raise taxes again and to extract more income from the Spanish sufferers Minister there may be only one more VOX left but do n't count on us to continue firing political spending in an irresponsible way while hiding the reality from the Spaniards of how the fiscal pressure is rising Families SMEs traders and self employed people have endured much they can no longer do so According to the Civismo Foundation the Spaniards worked on average 193 days to fulfill their tax obligations until July 13th the day of fiscal liberation but it is that with the inflation of 10,5 for which the dogmatism of this government is very responsible the Spaniards will work thirty eight more days this year until August 20th only to counter the rise in prices and you not only avoid suppressing one of their privileges and prebends not only do you not deflate the IRPF receiving 15 billion euros extra it is that above you announce more ascents Ladies and gentlemen this government has already done too much damage to Spain it has blown up the foundations of budgetary policy and once again Your Honor we are going to say no VOX is not going to be co-responsible for this hunchback Rectify re-activate the path of responsibility approve a credible fiscal consolidation plan and therefore return the credibility to the public accounts of a nation which is the best presentation card in the outside world because you may be overwhelmed by mathematics and the game is to exchange prisoners for budgets but that time is running out ladies and gentlemen The Spaniards will soon stop paying for the party of sanchismo because very soon the time will come and Spain will decide Thank you very much"
By allusions because Mr. Gómez Reino Don Antón said that I was telling Catalan jokes and I want to clarify that I was telling jokes of Eugeni Jofra Bafalluy Eugenio a great Catalan humorist who I recommend you to listen to Anyway
Thank you Madam President Madam Vice President on social media many memes many jokes many hoaxes are circulating and therefore you have to be very careful about what you are told to do So yesterday when I was sent this I thought it was a joke It turns out that here she says that the first vice president highlights the strength of the Spanish economy And I say man this has to be a meme It can not be true it can not be so detached from reality But then I looked at it and it turns out it 's the last official press release of his ministry And here we talk about the strength of the Spanish economy on every page of strong growth of how well things are going let 's go I I 'm curious this martianada that the Spaniards are not seeing the reality that their official reality goes on one side and the Spaniards on the other do you really believe this Do you believe that the Spanish can rely on the economic policy of this government
Minister in life there are lies serious lies and then statistics from the Ministry of Economy I mean I listen to her and I wonder if you really believe really I do n't think so that the Spanish on foot who suffer daily the consequences of their disastrous management are willing above all to have you fool them Do you think this is a grace to come here to Parliament and say that the data is different from what the Spanish are seeing every day Do you believe that there may be both unemployment people who do not find work and entrepreneurs who do not find workers for the world of construction for the world of hospitality or many jobs for which there is no relief You have managed simultaneously to make sure that in the countryside in the sea and in the whole primary sector you are at the worst time in the last 50 years You have got Spain to be at the tail of recovery As much as you say it is growing Spain is one of the last countries in the world not Europe in the world to achieve pre-crisis income levels We have not yet regained the previous level Minister We are at two digit inflation levels with the shopping basket above 15 things that the Spaniards had only seen in the news from third world countries You get to fill the tank of the car the delivery van the tractor or the tank of the fishing boat cost more than ever in history taking all the margin of the self employed working in the primary sector that taxes continue to rise and that the government 's collection continues to rise while the Spaniards earn less and less Look the Spaniards do n't trust you anymore it 's impossible for them to trust you The Spaniards only know and trust that we will move forward when we leave them behind
"Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen Spain is going badly Spain is going badly in fact Spain is the worst in Europe We are the country that later and worst we are recovering the pre-coronavirus pandemic levels because we are the economy that has suffered the greatest destruction of its productive fabric and because our homes have suffered the worst loss of purchasing power in the West That is the context in which we are discussing these budgets and unfortunately the latest economic growth data do not point to an improvement on the contrary they certify that the worrying economic slowdown that we are suffering from can be the antecedents of a recession that many institutions already give for sure That is that we are facing an economic stagnation in addition to the consistent inflation that is that you ladies and gentlemen of the Government are leading us to stagnation In addition a particular circumstance accompanies this context and is that we are in an electoral year with municipal autonomous and general elections around the corner and with your determination to govern with your alternative facts Therefore they try to convince us that we are the first in the class so they try to avoid the realization of the slightest self criticism and therefore instead of trying to solve our problems they aggravate them with irresponsible unreasonably and deeply damaging budgets for Spain Ladies and gentlemen the forecasts on which these budgets are based are absolutely unreal The nature of the revenue that makes it possible and the electoral nature of the expenditure committed do not lead to any other conclusion As we have been denouncing these budgets are designed by and for the premise of benefiting not the Spaniards not even the government not even the Socialist Party but only one person Pedro Sánchez And perhaps where most and best reflects the drift of this government 's budgetary policy is precisely in Titles I and II of these budgets that we are discussing today titles that describe the basic structure of the accounts which presents all the statements of revenue and expenditure of the state public sector and which ultimately consolidate a budgetary hole that threatens very seriously the sustainability of our public accounts Ladies and gentlemen in order to grow again with solid foundations to attract and retain foreign investment to encourage domestic investment to gain productivity to create stable employment and to successfully face the financing of public debt in the face of rising rates and as the European Central Bank continues to raise them Spain needs to fulfil a precondition to have credible public accounts and these simply are not Firstly because these accounts are based on forecasts that no one is believed to believe not even you forecasts unanimously rejected by national and international bodies from the AIReF to the Bank of Spain the IMF the OECD FUNCAS and a long time ago which make these budgets before they start a wet paper Secondly because they consolidate a chronic structural deficit with an expansion of public spending even above the extraordinary expenditure incurred in connection with the exceptional pandemic On average serious institutions believe that Spain will grow by 1 next year but you intend to raise spending ten times more giving up even a gesture with those Spaniards who ask for sacrifices that you do not want for yourselves because while 57 of the Spaniards fear not being able to pay their bills in the coming months the government of the twenty two ministries chronicles the waste of the most expensive executive of democracy You ladies and gentlemen are having a public spending party and passing the bill on to the Spaniards Those same Spaniards who are in danger of economic slowdown those Spaniards who are suffering the greatest impoverishment in forty years from the rise in prices those who you turn off the heating in winter and turn off the air conditioning in summer those who you propose to iron in the morning those same Spaniards are amazed at the spectacle of a government that is once again raising its salary which is once again setting a record of spending on advisors which is already 65 higher than they were when they arrived a government that throws away a real fortune in buying wills propaganda televisions trade unions tailor made surveys political tolls and the construction of an ideological imposition machinery by the public era with harmful consequences for all Spaniards and which does so while approving a tax increase with which it will continue to express to the Spanish middle and popular classes The Minister of Finance denied me three times that I was going to raise taxes but at the time of truth you have not left a tax behind The OECD says no developed country none has experienced an increase in fiscal pressure as high as Spain has in these years of Pedro Sánchez 's government No other has thought of raising taxes in the middle of a recovery Believe me that increase in the tax burden when what our productive fabric needed was more support than ever has much to do with us being the last in a recovery that does not arrive in Spain And in these budgets they do it again When we have not yet recovered economic activity prior to the crisis when the total hours worked are 0.9 points below the existing one then with 50,000 companies less than before the epidemic the Tax Agency is going to collect more taxes than ever 17 more for companies than before the pandemic 20 more for VAT and 30 more for IRPF In addition you have changed the system of calculation of the municipal surplus you have introduced disaster the Google rate the Tobin rate the plastic tax you have increased autonomous quotas the VAT of sugary and sweetened drinks corporate tax the taxation of pension plans the registration tax the insurance tax and the IRPF both on the side of labour income and on the side of capital income and savings And the Minister of Finance will continue to argue that taxes have not been raised With these budgets ladies and gentlemen the government is redoubling fiscal asphyxiation You who are responsible for this fiscal hack use many tales to try to deceive the Spaniards with the accounts but ladies and gentlemen the Spaniards are not fools and will react with their vote If you trust us we can promise you and promise that we will rebuild everything you are destroying There 's less left Thank you very much"
what his allies do not do with Article 2 which proclaims the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation
Thank you Mr. President On June 13 1898 the War Revenue Act was passed in the United States a law introducing temporary taxes including inheritance tax to finance the war in Cuba Well that war ended exactly two months later but 124 years later the Americans continue to suffer from the temporary inheritance tax I do n't know why I remembered that when I read today the title of your bill called for the establishment of temporary energy taxes and credit institutions And as the reading progressed socialist ladies and gentlemen I remembered more of that war initiated under a false pretext as was the sinking of Maine because in that war the United States was willing to do anything to gain access to world hegemony A little like Pedro Sánchez today is n't it The politician is willing to anything anyone to access and remain in power The one who was able to agree with those who for months promised that he would not agree the one who cast the political arm of ETA exchange prisoners for budgets returns today to the burden and puts his strict electoral interest before the economic responsibility and the interests of Spain and all the Spaniards Today together with his Marxist partners he brings us to this House an initiative that plans on the unconstitutional that solves nothing that damages the image of Spain that deteriorates legal security that compromises investment and employment and that at the same time you will see how you will end up paying all the Spaniards And they do so through a bill rather than making it as reasonable as it would have been through a bill a trapping process with which they try to avoid public consultation the memory of normative impact and the advice of the Council of State and which results in what was a cacicada from the beginning And let us remember how we have arrived here without listening to any of the sectors concerned without even informing the Minister of Finance today absent he should not be very interested in this initiative and without having made any prior study Pedro Sánchez considered however that it was a good announcement to bring to the debate about the state of the nation I could have used that debate for other things to do some self criticism for example there seemed to be reason for that It is possible that the fact that we were the only country in Europe to raise taxes after the pandemic hit explains that Spain has been released from economic recovery It may be that the fact that we are the only country in the European Union that is not reviewing and is not even considering revising its energy policy has had an impact on triggering energy costs The so called labour counter reform is likely to be connected to some extent with the fact that Spain is the country that has destroyed the most jobs in the second quarter of the year But no this government preferred to avoid any self criticism and return to the mantras we already know Franco virus Putin Franco virus Putin for whatever they think But lately Franco virus Putin is no longer enough to cover up all the clumsiness of the worst possible government at the worst possible time And surrounded by the gloomy reality that of the Resistance Manual decided to pull forward by incorporating a new mantra that of the dark powers gathered in scenes that smoke pure according to him He the president of the government who with the silence shelling complicity and cowardice of many of the greats of IBEX has done and undone has taken editorial and power centers and created the largest customer network in democratic history He now wants to play two bands now with the IBEX and against the IBEX But the result is always the same the impoverishment of the middle and working classes which once again no doubt will end up paying the consequences of their populist drift Because it will be SMEs middle and working classes families who will once again suffer from credit restrictions and the increase in the credit cost resulting from the impact of this bank balance sheet measure It will be these working classes precisely those that will be affected by the impact in terms of job destruction but above all they will carry on their backs the impact of this new rise in taxes Do you remember when I was repeatedly asking the Minister of Finance if she was going to raise taxes Mrs. Montero denied it until three times Do you remember that the socialist government will not raise taxes either to the middle class or to the working class And what came next we already know They did not leave a tax behind but it is that 84 of the tax haven focused precisely on middle and low incomes And this road map to further increase the tax burden on the Spaniards continues even if they try to hide it Measures such as the disaster which has increased the taxation of the sale of houses by 17 the non-deflation of the IRPF which we will talk about later which motivates the Spanish to pay 13 more in this tax until June simply because of the rise in prices and measures such as the one they bring here today because despite the government 's promises the taxes that today tell us that they are going to shut down the bank and the electrics do not fill any doubt that they will eventually be passed on to all the Spaniards Among other things the guidelines of the European Banking Authority the EBA require the bank to set its prices on the basis of the cost structure including tax costs So this rule is telling the Spanish bank not to comply with European regulation I 'll tell them that 's not gonna happen Ladies and gentlemen unfortunately some of those who today feel affected by this rule were silent when the government attacks tourism the car industry or when it attacks the meat industry Some of those who are concerned today and denounce the interventionism of the Government supported the dismantling of our industry decreed by the same Government acting in the name of climate religion Some of those who today demand our support did not give it to us when the education sector was being curtailed SMEs and self reliant people were being marginalized from European funds or red lines were being crossed that a democratic government should never have crossed It is never too late but the economic entrepreneurial and journalistic elites of this country because of their complicity and silence have a lot of responsibility for Sánchez to remain President of the Government Ladies and gentlemen in the devastating economic scenario we are in the last thing we need is new tax increases that put the recovery at risk and sink the Spaniards how Maine sank unnecessarily and under a false pretext to deceive the population about who has the responsibility I am mistaken which is precisely the only thing this Government is doing well Thank you very much
Thank you Madam President From the producers of no one sees a crisis in the short term from the creator of the recovery will be in the form of V from the screenwriter of the saga there is no precedent in the economic history of Spain for such a rapid recovery of employment activity and from the creator of it is a transitional phenomenon it would be premature to consider inflation as a problem this autumn we get economic indicators do not point to a recession This initiality is now presented to us by you against the forecasts of the independent authorities of the main analysis houses the AIReF Funcas BBVA Research Everyone is already talking about falling GDP in that quarter and they have no doubt that we will also fall in the next quarter That Your Honor two consecutive quarters of fall is called recession Madam Minister as you know the evolution of the economy is greatly influenced by the expectations of economic operators and therefore the credibility of the government 's forecasts is absolutely essential Unfortunately you do n't get one That is why I ask you today November 2 2022 what growth of the Spanish economy is forecast for this last quarter of the year and for the first of the following year
Your Honor I see you a little aggressive but you are not able to answer a very simple very technical question I 've asked you what forecast you have for this last quarter and the coming one and you 've answered me a completely different thing I was n't asking about the growth forecast this year What I do say is that Spain has not yet recovered the GDP of 2019 I do n't know if it 's any good for you What I 'm telling you is that the third quarter has slowed down in the dry What I do say is that the dreaded fall of exports is a reality What I 'm telling you is that it 's still slowing down consumption What I am saying is that we still have the highest unemployment rate in Europe Every time you talk about job creation do n't forget that two out of three jobs have been created by you in the public administration By means of this system we could end the unemployment tomorrow morning You hire four million civil servants and we 're done And do not forget Your Honor that inflation remains at very high levels Do not trust that it is 7 because that means that the Spanish are 7 poorer than a year ago It 's not a figure to be happy with Ladies and gentlemen you are not going to go into history of course into the economic history of Spain for nothing good They will not even pass into history because they are the government that gave entry to the extreme left and to all the enemies of the nation You will pass into history because you are the government that brought the stagnation to Spain
"Thank you Madam President Madam Vice President last week I told you that your government was presiding over the biggest fall in gross domestic product since the Spanish civil war and you told me I do n't know what about Franco that ghost that you like and also President Sánchez said something about it Look I 'll get you a graph so you can keep an eye on it Do you see this low Do you see a drop of 10,8 in gross domestic product The worst fall since the Spanish civil war It is not Franco it is Pedro Sánchez and it is you Mrs Calviño who are sinking the Spaniards It 's economic history of Spain And you are already part of it but of course for evil I also asked her a few weeks ago about inflation when we were at 6.1 by the way several weeks before the Ukraine war and you in your usual self congratulation tone told me that the government was taking many steps assured me that the government 's energy policy was going to allow a cleaner cheaper energy and then you did n't talk about Franco but you said what about LGBT minorities that have nothing to do with the issue I did n't believe him and I did it right because you know what 's going on We now know that inflation is not only above 6 but it is at 7.4 Minister with you Spaniards are 7.4 poorer than a year ago We have the highest inflation in Europe after twelve months of inflation Minister what are you going to do How does it explain that inflation is at the highest of the last thirty this year"
"Madam Vice President I see that what is not COVID is Ukraine and that with that you will follow the whole legislature either COVID or Ukraine But the reality is that you already have a full legislature you have been in government for four years stop putting your failed ideology before the Spanish interests Minister because it is you who are sinking Spain This same week when the light is at its historical maximum price you approved yesterday 20,300 million euros I do not invent it it is impossible to invent for cross-cutting feminist policies Wonderful 20 billion A family of four in Spain will pay 1800 euros for Mrs Montero 's whims These are their cross-cutting feminist policies This same week with gas at two euros per litre you propose more taxes do n't you Minister of Finance More taxes on natural gas gasoline and diesel This same week while you suffocating the Spaniards you approve grants to class unions for 17 million euros Do you know for what So they do n't go out on the street But do n't worry because the Spaniards are going out on the street even if the unions do n't come out Next March 19th the Spaniards will go out and tell them that we will not go forward until we leave them behind"
Thank you Madam President I begin by drinking water to overcome the drink that the secretary general of the Communist Party accuses us of communists which is the last thing I needed to see in this House So far the Comedy Club Go talk to your communist friends around the world with the FARC with the Venezuelans with Putin 's allies and with Putin who is his ally but do n't come here and make jokes because that 's already in very bad taste Look we 're talking about the state of the nation debate It is a debate that has been taking place since 1983 as has already been said in this House Except in electoral years it has been an annual meeting in which we have always been able to take stock of serious things not what we are hearing now about what is happening in this country With Felipe González the debate on the state of the nation came to be held ten times Mr Aznar and Mr Zapatero celebrated it in six Mr Rajoy in three but Pedro Sánchez resists calling It has been four years but it has not given us time as the secretary general of the Communist Party tells us because it has been a little hasty There has n't been time in four years Well that 's why of course it 's not because of lack of conviction The very words of Mr. Pedro Sánchez are very eloquent I remind them when they were in the opposition because as they do not remember and they then said in the opposition Pedro Sánchez himself A lot of transparency law he said but the government confirms that this year there will be no debate on the state of the nation I mean Mr. Sánchez was in favour of celebrating it At that time when he said so it had only been seven months since the formation of this Government not seven years Nor should it be for lack of reason to justify it because there is plenty to justify this debate such as the policy of the pacts of this Government which is proving lethal for Spain all that is needed is to listen to the Secretary General of the Communist Party We have not just digested that Spain is the only country in the civilized world where there are communists in a government this is something we have very easily normalized Sánchez has given the rule of law to people like you Mr Santiago you who have never believed in the Constitution or in freedom or democracy He has approved pardons for people like you who have never believed in the nation either He has allied himself with ages people like you who have the past that you have and that we all remember All just to approve their budgets He has signed the departure of Spaniards from the classrooms of the schools of Catalonia He broke the one size fits all Social Security box He has surrendered by signing the departure of the Civil Guard in Navarre Why talk about your economic policy It has placed Spain as the most backward country from the crisis in the Western world The unemployment rate is again the highest in Europe GDP suffered the biggest fall in Europe Moreover I will repeat this to the Socialists because they have not heard it well the biggest fall in GDP since the Civil War and it is not Franco 's it is yours Socialists to put on how you put on Inflation is 7.4 the highest in thirty three years The debt is the highest in history the Spaniards are more indebted than they have ever been Institutional deterioration is rampant The Democracy Index 2021 has gone from considering our country a full democracy to calling it defective a real shame for all Spaniards Violence and crime have returned to our neighbourhoods and we have suffered the greatest migratory invasions since the years of the Green March Spain has seen its weight sink into the world until it became the laughing stock of the West partly because of the fear generated by the fact that we actually have the only government in the civilized world with communists within it I could go on because the reasons for this debate remain but Pedro Sánchez does not want this House to debate the situation in Spain and precisely that is the most obvious reason for the deep and systematic disregard of the government of Pedro Sánchez for this House and for the role of the legislature The juggling of Congress and its postponement to a secondary and marginal role in Spanish politics represents only the tip of the sanchest drift iceberg which is nothing more than the continuous and permanent deterioration and destabilization of State institutions which puts them at the service not of a government and a party but simply of an individual Pedro Sánchez We have warned on many occasions we have suffered a rapid devaluation of our institutional framework and that must ignite all the alarms We have seen it with the Prosecutor 's Office with the attempts to submit to the judiciary with the taking of power of the Court of Auditors with collaborationism of course with the Attorney General 's Office with the CNMC with the partisan use of CIS or Spanish Broadcasting and of course with the none of the transparency laws to which Pedro Sánchez himself referred Those of us who believe in democracy know that with the maintenance and integrity of the good functioning of our institutions we play a great role We therefore believe that this debate is appropriate I am concerned yes that VOX has on many occasions been the only voice that has been heard in this House to denounce the things that this Government has been doing the only one who has obtained the protection of the Constitutional Court in defence of the need to maintain the control activity of the Government during the confinement the only one who has denounced the abuse of the Royal Decree Law by this Government the only one who has been denouncing the absence of ministers in the control sessions to the Government or the only one who has not ceased to denounce the blackmail that it means sending to Brussels a recovery plan without having approved it in this house which is who should have approved it
It 's over The rehabilitation of the dignity and respect that this House deserves is urgent The holding of the debate on the state of the nation is a necessary condition but not sufficient because we will never cease to remind it in order for Spain to move forward we must leave you behind Thank you very much
Thank you Madam President Minister I find that disconcerting The other day and today too she was proud of this Government 's economic work I hope not Minister I hope you are not proud to be impoverishing Spain you and your Government because in 2012 Spain was the country where poverty increased the most throughout Europe according to Eurostat According to another less reliable source I just heard Pedro Sánchez ten minutes ago two million children are poor in Spain I know you did n't trust the source much but two million children are poor and you 're proud Are you really proud to impoverish Spain so much Do you realize that it is your responsibility that the Spaniards are poorer today than they were three years ago
Your Honor there is no doubt that you are committed to eradicating wealth We prefer to eradicate poverty Since you have come to this government I do not know any Spaniards who have prospered except of course you and the undocumented Podemos Yes yes this irresponsibility is yours Minister and I refer to the evidence Unemployment the unemployment you were talking about is the biggest cause of poverty in Spain Spain leads unemployment in the European Union and this government with its reforms is far from correcting the problem and is helping to make it worse The rise in taxes is being foolish when the Spanish least have it is when you collect more and in fact Spain is leading the increase in fiscal pressure in the OECD countries leaving the Spanish with empty pockets You are bringing public debt to levels that compromise not only our future but the future of our children and grandchildren because the country 's debt Your Honor also affects poverty especially in an up interest rate environment like the one we are living in Another figure is the zero zero economic growth because Spain has not even recovered the pre-pandemic level yet and now until the AIReF lowers its economic forecasts to 1.5 for next year A disaster Nothing Your Honor we are in stagnation and you are approaching the risk of recession And inflation Your Honor the uncontrolled price escalation the real middle class tax is triggered and is the worst Spanish tax Minister socialism is a machine for creating poor people We thought Zapatero was impossible to make worse but you 're spraying all of Spain 's impoverishment records Proud not Your Honor you and your entire government should be ashamed Go away but before you go apologize for all the damage you 're doing It 's going to take a lot to get Spain back when they leave
Thank you Madam President Madam Vice President I am listening to you and I see that you are still on the same path Week after week you continue in your heroic effort to convince us that in Spain everything is going well that you are doing everything perfectly and that if there is any problem then it is either Franco 's fault or the virus or Putin's Meanwhile reality goes another way The reality is that the National Institute of Statistics presents us week after week with economic data that you really leave very badly such as this week 's data published by the INE showing that Spain has slowed its growth we are only 0.2 two points less than in the previous quarter and of course inflation in two digits above 10 That 's why his partners tell him that the watermelons and melons are going up but they 're going up absolutely all the prices that the Spaniards pay The truth is that we have been for many months not a matter of weeks but months with bad economic data data that you do n't like so as you do n't like instead of working to improve them with common sense and convrudence as you do n't know what they do is to stop the data subject taking charge of the president of the INE The purpose is nothing but to replace you with someone who likes you As I 'm afraid there wo n't be many professionals willing to play their professional prestige they will end up putting another Tezanos any of their party someone who does n't care to harm the good name of another institution that you stand before It is the same thing that they have done with the Prosecutor 's Office with the CNI or this very week with Indra or what they have done with the necessary collaboration of the PP with the Court of Auditors or with the Constitutional Court which you still go and say they have not renewed it but if you have renewed it with them less than a few months ago Minister You destroy everything without disguise you are already leaving but in your flight forward you want to take everything forward And in case there is little the serious management deficit in the interior that we all know In addition they place Spain in an even more serious situation with its foreign policy errors Since Sánchez 's turn so personal in the Sahara Spain which depended on 42 of Algerian gas he is having to buy gas from the Americans costing 40 more How much do you estimate to be damaging to the Spanish economy for your government 's errors in foreign affairs
It is a classic of this government that we ask what we ask you to go to your triangle you have already said far right If I did n't say far right or Franco I had to say Putin and but I would have to say virus You said far right you 've gone to your magic triangle But do you know what 's going on Madam Vice President That the magic triangle no longer hangs because it's not the ultra- right it 's not the virus and it's not Putin sonustedes You are the biggest burden the biggest burden that the Spaniards have behind them the families the merchants the SMEs the companies the workers and the self employed have a great burden which you are You guys every time
Thank you Madam President Madam Vice President the farmers the farmers the people living in rural Spain Spain abandoned by you leads a life far from politics very attached to the ground very rooted in its natural environment They like to be clear to call things by their name to call bread and wine wine and so they are too quick to understand that their rulers those of the 2030 Agenda with their colored hats and with their goodness have forgotten about them I have been with many of them lately in this campaign in Burgos in Arévalo in Medina del Campo in Toro in Aguilar de Campoo You know what they say They say they want to be heard They have asked us to give them a voice by denouncing rulers who attack them perhaps because they do n't know them and certainly because they do n't listen to them And for that we are to give them voice and to defend them I wonder why this government ignores the needs of rural Spain
So for you the countryside is victimized that is you are the prototype of city center politics that completely ignores what happens there Look you 've done a good review of exactly everything you do n't have to do You are attacking the countryside daily and indeed the Minister of Labour attacks it when in a frivolous and irresponsible way she says that there is slavery in the countryside your words Minister even if Spain is a country with the most demanding labour standards in Europe He mentions the Minister of Ecological Transition whose energy pricing policy has triggered production costs and by the way especially farmers and farmers whom you want to ban diesel Prohibiting diesel in the field minister would give for an entire afternoon to explain what that means The Minister of Finance has raised all generic taxes and all autonomous quotas in addition to green taxes she has not left a tax behind You speak of the Minister for Agriculture who has said that it is a good agreement to cut the common agricultural policy Or the Minister of Consumer Affairs who by the way has been a coward and has not come today to the first control session he had after the last barbarity he has said and who attacks the Spanish countryside To the countryside Minister the government attacks which allows the wolf to camp wide threatening precisely our cattle And they attack the camp all those who make the survival of the camp impossible precisely because there is no generational relief What you say that there has been a minister dealing with the demographic transition is an absolute failure You 've been ruling for four years now and everything you say you 're going to do could have been done in the previous four years All those who force the field to produce at loss those who force the field to submit to taxes and conditions that are not required of the product that comes from abroad are those who are killing the field It can be either with the field or with the 2030 Agenda I know who you 're with VOX will always be with the field and that 's why more and more the field is with VOX
Thank you Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen we have been saying this for years generating quality scientific knowledge being able to transfer it to society encouraging innovative spirit taking advantage of all technological potential is one of the safest recipes to drive economic growth on solid foundations and make a more prosperous society The scientific and technological advances have been the preamble to great periods of growth it has always been so so now in a period subject to great changes in which the spectacular technological advances are proving to have an extraordinary capacity to increase the productivity of our economy it was more important than never to fail to science I am very optimistic about the relevant role that science could play in the future of Spain I am also very optimistic about the ability of our scientists to become an essential factor in our productive model but that project would require vision knowledge and ambition a vision and ambition that we have been able to see how in a country in permanent conflict such as Israel it has made it a scientific power a vision and ambition that has made South Korea a country that until recently was poorer than Ghana the world 's most innovative country a vision and ambition that have transformed a backward country such as Ireland into a global technological benchmark In VOX of course we support the pact for science whose success is a necessary but not sufficient condition to give a definitive boost to science in Spain Indeed the scenario in which we find ourselves is one in which we are experiencing the biggest collapse of gross domestic product since the Spanish civil war in which we are suffering an irresponsible economic policy that is lagging behind us in the recovery of gross domestic product in which we have to endure the spiralling increase in public debt which is going to be like a slab on the back and shoulders of our young people and we are seeing a rise in interest rates that threatens to leave our public accounts in a very delicate situation Well in that scenario improving the stagnant productivity of our economy is not that it's an option it 's that it 's our only way out And if there is an investment capable of improving our growth potential that investment certainly has to be in science innovation development and technology Unfortunately the failure of scientific policy in recent decades has not contributed precisely to improving our competitiveness on the contrary it has forced our researchers to work in precarious conditions and in many cases to undertake an exodus abroad from which we have never recovered not even with cosmetic return operations lacking a path for lack of ambition Therefore if there is a time when in Spain we should more urgently support innovation and science to improve our growth potential that time is certainly now And if there is an urgent debt to be paid it is one that we have with scientists condemned to precariousness bureaucracy and lack of funds Science must be supported with determination with economic means with job stability with an effective framework for collaboration with companies Therefore from the VOX Parliamentary Group we support without cracks that the budget for science is increased to 1.25 of GDP in 2030 as the law says or that the situation of precarious work of the research staff is corrected or that progress is made in the transfer of knowledge and results in the research activity But ladies and gentlemen this law not only does not guarantee a greater and better impulse of science in Spain but in many cases makes it difficult In VOX we know a little better than most of you the world of science research and development and innovation That is why we have tabled over 100 pages of amendments that is why we have proposed improvements and we have denounced many aspects of this text which are tremendously damaging to science and today I am doing it again from this rostrum Our commitment to science today leads us not to sign a blank cheque not to accept as valid a commitment that is wet paper if not accompanied by other measures and not to silence in the face of the attack of trying to subject science to its ideological dogmas This law does not address and therefore does not resolve the structural deficiencies affecting Spanish science It is only necessary to listen to the more than thirty scientific experts who have appeared in this House during the processing of this text But the problem does not lie there this law is framed in an educational budgetary ideological policy which if we fail to stop and believe me we will could condemn Spanish science for decades because the policies of identification capture and retention of the research talent begin in the classrooms We need more young researchers younger ones who want to devote their efforts to science Scientific policy suffers in its bases when educational policy deteriorates as is the case with this Government when students can graduate without passing courses when the rule of three or the minimum common denominator is replaced by socio-emotional skills or when even mathematics is used to indoctrinate and the aim is to introduce a gender perspective into science Ladies and gentlemen listen to me do n't fight math math always wins But the most serious thing about this law which is why VOX cannot support it is that it intends to kidnap science to put it at the service of Pedro Sánchez 's ideological project Ladies and gentlemen this bill imposes sex discrimination in the scientific sphere by relegating the criteria of excellence merit and ability to be replaced by criteria of what you call gender It is scientific scientific to charge scientists with gender impact reports for approval of their projects It is a question of establishing quotas as an element other than scientific excellence And what 's at stake is introducing gender commissioners into research teams Ladies and gentlemen the ideology and sectarianism that even this government makes of science will generate the consequence of not being able to count on the best in the scientific field a consequence that we will all pay for for a long time You leave us with an erial a Spain that is lagging behind and in debt and an endless number of laws that have put whole institutions agencies and systems at the service of your dogmas
When we govern we will strive to attract retain and provide resources and promote the best the most outstanding scientists be they men or women And we 've been giving everyone a voice since VOX today because Spanish science is much better than its politicians Thank you very much
Thank you Madam President You speak Minister of telling the truth And as you know the truth is that there is nothing more to talk about on the subway than the renewal of the General Council of Judicial Power but in a very distant second place the Spaniards also talk about the strong economic growth of Spanish GDP especially compared to Europe To me when I stand on the street everyone tells me Give many memories to the Minister of Economy and Peter you are the co-authors of this Spanish miracle I thank you for what is growing Spain I thank you for how cheap the shopping basket is How we enjoy paying so little for the price of gas gasoline and electricity When do you think you will understand that your triumphalistic message about economic growth has nothing to do with the daily reality of the Spaniards
Madam Minister in addition to sinking the Spaniards you come here with a bad temper and make jokes You will have to turn your back on this government Let 's try to lighten up a little but for the sake of the Spaniards I 'm going to change the subject slightly though not much Do you like football You follow the league Do you know who won the league last year Well I 'll tell you Last year the league won Real Madrid Do you know who went down to Monday Three teams are down every year and among them there was a very dear team that went down to Second which is the Levante But something very curious happened in last year 's league Although Real Madrid in the last few days was the one that added more points because it added 20 points in the last nine days the Levante with only 16 points added grew by 84 the team that grew the most throughout the League Do you know what that means Absolutely nothing Regrettably the Levant went down to Second was penultimate because it grew much but was not worth anything Do you know why Because it was from a very small base When you start from a very small base no matter how much you grow absolutely nothing happens You are here every day saying that Spain grows more than anyone But do you know what reality is That this is the league in which you play in which you are coach the European economic league the league of economic growth measured by GDP Eurostat data And you know what 's going on That as much as you say that Spain is the fastest growing between 2019 and 2021 the latest annual data we have Spain is at the tail of the European Union In the same way that they had to change the coach in the Levante when it was last we should probably change the coach in the European economic league and in that case in the Spanish one because you what is the coach Your Honor have lowered us to the second division
Thank you very much Madam President Madam Vice President the Ph.D. in Economics who has on his right former advisor to Caja Madrid that institution of politicians who had to rescue the Spaniards has referred a while ago to the reduction of inflation this has been said but the truth is that prices continue to rise Minister not decreasing although they do so at lower growth rates than in the previous period Do n't fool the Spaniards because people when they go shopping notice Prices are still rising In the last control session I asked you a rather simple question I asked him what the growth forecasts were for the last quarter of the year You had two and a half minutes to answer me and you were n't able to give me the data Let us try this time with an equally simple question What is your forecast of growth for the Spanish economy in the first quarter of next year
I do n't know if it 's the audio or if it does n't sound good but it 's just that I have n't heard the data For the second consecutive week I ask you for a data what is the growth data of the Spanish economy and for the second consecutive week you do not give it to me And you know why you do n't give it to me Because you never get it right Minister because all your predictions are broken We will never know if you deceive yourselves or want to deceive others What we do know is that we are already at least in a significant slowdown in activity by using the words of the Governor of the Banco España that is we are stagnant Minister because in the previous quarter the Spanish economy grew by 0.2 and at best the Banco de España expects that for this quarter we will grow by 0.2 I mean in the previous quarter nothing and now nothing nothing And the saddest part neither in all 2022 nor in all 2023 we will recover the economic level of 2019 in fact the Banco España has ruled out that GDP recovers until 2024 That is to say for the first time in many years at least since the reception of the PSOE in Zapatero look at what a horror of reference the Spaniards will get out of this legislature poorer than how we arrived This is why you will go into history Minister you Pedro Sánchez and your entire government because of the economic collapse of Spain But in addition to economics you are sinking Spain in morals in politics in what has to do with our confidence with our coexistence with the security and with the hope of the future of the Spaniards Minister although in the press you have gone completely unnoticed last Sunday tens of thousands of Spaniards went out to the streets to cry out against a government that is sinking into all aspects of their lives and they were not even all of VOX although only VOX is left to mobilize the street as other parties and trade unions refuse to do so But lose all hope we will be here to face this radical left which governs us and which you represent in institutions in the streets and in the ballot box Thank you very much
Thank you very much President Very good afternoon Ladies and gentlemen it is not surprising that the left has a problem with prostitution wanting to solve this problem with four articles There are many elements to take into account in such a complicated framework largely criminal in addition to the values at stake such as freedom of course and personal dignity The Socialist Party intends to abolish prostitution and to that end in its proposal proposes a series of measures which are partial which are incomplete and some of which are clearly senseless They propose to extend the criminal type of pimping with which our group is absolutely in agreement we will even propose that penalties be increased when it comes to minors or persons with disabilities They propose to penalize what they call the rental third party We will put forward an amendment which should only be penalised when there is fraud We are very concerned about how they are going to make this transition from tolerance to prohibition when there are only over a thousand brothels on the roads throughout Spain We did n't go into any more evaluations but they have n't done the previous job They shall consider all clients or sex claimants to be criminals and liable to punishment when providing financial assistance and even if there is free consent How can it be proved that there has been a counter performance What if the reward is a trip or a bag or the lover puts an apartment in it Focus directly on legal certainty We amend that of course clients are punished when they are able to know the victim 's situation of exploitation or minority On the other hand the members of the CUP propose to legalize prostitution that is their amendment The legalization of prostitution would have many harmful effects including considering it a very good thing to trade with one 's own body But gentlemen of the UPC what is the percentage of people who are exercising prostitution on a voluntary basis What is really important and what needs to be solved is the cases of slavery that are taking place 90 of prostitution comes from trafficking that is where the focus must be Because prostitution in real life does n't look like the movie Pretty Woman None of his lordships escape the situation of many immigrants who are deceived into coming to Spain they are made to incur a debt that they will pay by prostitution and withhold their passport Or do you not know that there are brothels even with bars in the windows That is the reality and in view of that reality what you propose both the Socialist Party and the UPC in this amendment is that all people who are in an irregular situation and who are engaged in prostitution should be regularized and this is where the contradictions come in I ask you how is it possible to protect women from sexual exploitation and not to stop or control illegal immigration Is it not a contradiction to want to abolish prostitution and to propose to regularize people who are prostitution Because of course it will increase trafficking and produce an important effect called it In order to obtain papers the path is easy to engage in prostitution they seek to institutionalize that path What needs to be done is to curb trafficking by persecuting it and increasing penalties as we propose in addition to making available to these people a real social policy of training of employment integration but never regularisation which would only benefit the mafias Secondly another major contradiction of the PSOE I ask you how is it possible to penalize a man who has sex with a prostitute freely and I do not enter into evaluations and at the same time from his Government is inducing himself to have sex with minors that is when he is consenting But does the child have the capacity to consent or refuse before an adult And it was not a mere statement I encourage you to consider article 183 of the Criminal Code which reformed the law of only yes where it says The free consent of a person under the age of sixteen years will exclude criminal responsibility for crimes of sexual abuse when the perpetrator is a person close to the minor 's poreness or maturity Moreover the hypersexualization that his Government was promoting towards minors was neither casual nor innocent Right to know your own body to three four or five years in school is as Minister Montero now calls the right to corruption of minors Awakening sexual instincts in unripe ages is having tremendous effects such as addiction to pornography since the age of eight it is beginning to consume How is the increase in sexual offences at an increasingly early age explained And they do n't fix it Another great contradiction of the PSOE They propose abolishing prostitution because they say it violates women 's freedom What are we left with Do you have the right to decide on your own body as you defend or do you not have the right to decide And I do n't go into ratings In short ladies and gentlemen they have an important mental cocoa And I do not leave behind the hypocrisy they incur when they do not fight illegal immigration and trafficking when they have not condemned the barbaric exploitation in Baleares and Valencia when comrades have gone to brothels with ERE money With this law they would be criminals Ladies and gentlemen all this leads us to believe that its objective is not the abolition of prostitution or that it diminishes as it would be desirable you feed the causes and do not provide sensible and effective remedies to eradicate prostitution I raise an important issue for you if you want to reduce prostitution fight illegal immigration fight trafficking reduce the misery that has increased with your Government reduce situations at risk of poverty and very importantly ladies and gentlemen end the hypersexualisation of minors and of course stop Minister Montero As long as you do n't do all this ladies and gentlemen as long as you do n't do all this do n't tell us you want to end prostitution Thank you
"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the amendments that come from the Senate do not improve the text of the law because they cannot improve it because the spirit that inspires it remains intact as well as the attacks on the principles of legal certainty and proportionality and on fundamental rights in particular on the fundamental right to freedom of expression and the freedom of parents to educate their children according to their convictions remain intact In addition it even attacks private property That this law pursues equality and non-discrimination is simply a lie ladies and gentlemen It is a lie it is a farce because it is already regulated in the different areas with multiple regulations even anti-Gyptanism is regulated in the Penal Code This law is an instrument for a cultural change that they are propitiating against the reality of things and the very being of man which is impossible to achieve through reason and is imposed by force They will sanction those who disagree with official thinking be called gender ideology Agenda 2030 discard culture climate change or historical memory To this end ladies and gentlemen an agency is created the independent authority it is the ministry of truth of Orwell and a sanctioning regime of up to 500,000 euros is established It is a punitive law in many cases it imposes harsher sanctions than those of the Criminal Code and lacks the necessary objectivity in the criminalization of offences With the simple threat of imposing these sanctions it will deter anyone who wants to give a different opinion whether it be a journalist a teacher or a film director by directly attacking freedom of thought and will create a truly suffocating climate We ask ourselves several questions How is it possible that they are defending non-discrimination while passing a law like this which produces scandalous inequality Equal treatment and non-discrimination laws of the Autonomous Communities or LGTBI as they are also called have the same purpose which is not the fight against discrimination but the imposition of an anti-scientific ideology where the will or desire is the determinant of sex In a society as relativistic as this where unfortunately the total absence of certainties prevails wanting to sow doubt about one 's own sex from young is simply perverse There is a law right now in the Galician community that has passed the law on gender ideology as a subject Well all of these laws have a different sanctioning regime and very seriously violate the principle of equality They are laws which both for the matter and for the sanctioning regime should be subordinated to this national however it is this one which is envisaged as a subsidiary to those of the autonomous communities An example ladies and gentlemen a conduct of harassment of a person on grounds of sexual orientation that is not considered an offence is classified as very serious and in each of the autonomous communities there will be a different sanction In one autonomous community the penalty will be up to EUR 6000 in others it will be up to EUR 30 000 in others it will be up to EUR 40 000 in others it will be up to EUR 45 000 in others it will be up to EUR 300 000 in Catalonia it will be up to EUR 500 000 and with this law it will be EUR 500 000 Ladies and gentlemen this is an exercise in scandalous cynicism This law adds language as a cause of discrimination How do you explain that in Baleares with the Socialist president more than 3000 cellers who were during the pandemic were expelled from the call for interims because they did not present the certificate that accredits the knowledge of the Catalan language How do you explain ladies and gentlemen if this law defends that no one can be excluded from health care that palliative care can be refused throughout the national territory and only half the population can benefit How is it possible that there are crimes where people with sex are punished more How is it possible ladies and gentlemen that you are defending equality Let 's go to what this law collects which collects pearls like the following Article 4 is offensive to women They assume that in Spain being a woman is an obstacle to access to education employment health and justice ladies and gentlemen when in Spain 60 of judges are judges It is not an obstacle to access to justice when 60 of those who pass judgements are women Are you in full judgment when you affirm this However ladies and gentlemen it is not an obstacle to being a minister in some cases the only merit is that Ladies and gentlemen this law also attacks concerted schools which will not be subsidized unless they assume gender identity or expression It will be a problem on sports issues with the issue of gender identity In addition they introduce asphyxiating interventionism How is it possible that a tenant cannot rent his house to whom he considers it appropriate It is an attack on private property owned by communist regimes This is your equality law Ladies and gentlemen the totalitarian states what they want to turn into ours also come from democratic regimes and we already have evidence in recent history of Europe By attacking fundamental rights you avoid reports where this could be confirmed you did so with the law of euthanasia and you are doing so with those who have biases of unconstitutionality Do you know the way The path is the easiest with a proposal of law without any report and avoiding public information They will avoid the reports ladies and gentlemen but they cannot avoid VOX which will be those who denounce and those who remember them and those who will also appeal these laws who are violating fundamental rights That is why even if they attack the institutions by appointing the members of the Constitutional Court that suit them so that when the Spaniards send them out of the Government there will remain a Constitutional Court in line with their postulates it will not matter as long as VOX exists That is why the existence of VOX is so necessary because it is the only parliamentary group that opposes and resists the cultural battle they are waging the only one that defends the human rights that every State must recognize because they are pre-existing Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party it is not the economy it is not just the economy The left is delighted to hear it because it trusts them in their cultural change but ladies and gentlemen of the PP it is not only the economy If values are not recognized if what is true and what is good is not recognized how will the economy know how to recognize what is useful I 'm done Madam President I end up talking about equality VOX defends the equality of all Spaniards who do not differ because of their sexual orientation All equal under the same flag the flag of Spain"
Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the aim of the law we amend is to strengthen the right to abortion considering itself to be an absolutely banal conduct the banality of taking off your own child and imposing that culture of supposed normality from very early ages without allowing dissent A right that really is a counter right because it can never be considered a right to kill a human being In the face of any doubt or problem it cancels the possibility of a child being born They eliminate three days of reflection and information on aids and alternatives and even parental support for minors That 's their freedom real state violence She 's a real savage Sanitaries who are faithful to their professional vocation must be registered on a list to defend their right to conscientious objection It 'll be the stigmatized ones We say that they must be those who are not faithful to their profession and want to practice abortions that must be registered on that list We oppose women to consider themselves chronically ill with the treatment they do about menstruation As for the surrogate gestation the proposed modification seems to us to be a hair removal They cannot argue against these practices that cosmify women and make the child a subject of commerce and only eliminate the advertising of these agencies If they were consistent they should have prevented women from enslaving themselves to be pregnant for others and an act deemed null in our country from having legal effects The regulation of abortion as a right is the last reason that measures the health of a society Respect for democratic values or not is the issue that shakes its foundations the one that determines its justice the one that makes us consider when a human society has ceased to be it is the one that determines decadence or progress Ladies and gentlemen this is the subject that defines all of us and fundamentally this government Ladies and gentlemen if we do not defend the life of the most helpless the life of that human being as well as ours with which only the time of its development differentiates us if we do not do our best to ensure that those lives are not destroyed in the womb of their mother can you tell me what we are doing here What have we come to defend Ladies and gentlemen what have we come to defend At the same time as this debate is taking place this Congress itself is debating the value of the life of an animal to be protected Value and protection that a human being is denied for the purpose of humanizing the animal and dehumanizing the human being They do it the same day with total provocation It 's a real challenge and a bloodbath Ladies and gentlemen this extreme undermines the most elementary principle of justice And politics ladies and gentlemen must only look for what is right Following the classics I would say to you if we eliminate justice what would the state distinguish from a large band of bandits The consideration of the value of a unique and unrepeatable life from its conception is the great challenge of a civilization and in particular of our nation We 're killing ourselves destroying ourselves We 're killing ourselves ladies and gentlemen We 're killing ourselves Ladies and gentlemen many lives are at stake but democratic values are also at stake He quoted Norberto Bobbio If the rule of majority is to be regarded as a democratic mechanism it must be subject to certain necessary limits Within these limits there is no doubt the right to life which must always be recognized by the State and which it does not grant They are the basic principles of a democracy Not recognizing it thus inexorably leads us to totalitarianism The right to life of each and every one of us cannot be decided by consensus ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party It is not consensus that decides whether life has value or not it is not consensus The time limits law adopted in 2010 which introduced abortion as a right did so against the constitutional doctrine which had already ruled on the supreme value of life and that nasciturus is a constitutionally protected legal good It responded to the will of a radical feminism whose goal was to culturally modify our society prey to international organizations and to further normalize that conduct as it has been thanks to an indolent president like Rajoy and over time Constitutional doctrine the spirit of our Constitution our tradition in our culture would force the Constitutional Court to declare the Aided Law unconstitutional The consequences after twelve years of inaction are absolutely irreparable This radical feminism not only harms the unborn In the face of a drama like this women are left alone and considering a right as a good thing it will be the only way to be offered If they have the sensitivity to listen they will know the truth in all their cruelty She 's never been so unprotected According to you as motherhood enslaves you you must not protect it making it the greatest victim of this ill feminism By the way minister last week we asked you about the sentence you have sentenced abortionists for cheating on women and hiding that abortion has consequences But he did not answer me he could not answer me he was removed in his seat because in his fictitious and false account he cannot recognize that it has consequences and in this way also from the Government he deceives women Let 's go back to the law Ladies and gentlemen to animalise human beings what better instrument than indoctrination than treating children as animals They will be educated in the promotion of abortion and contraception based on so called sexual and reproductive rights legitimizing sexual liberating including paedophilia according to the statements of Minister Montero on the relevance of affective sexual relations of minors with third parties with prior consent Ladies and gentlemen abortion is the result of the exaltation of the sexual revolution in its most devastating extremes Ladies and gentlemen paedophilia too This is simply perverse
Anyway ladies and gentlemen you should reflect You should reflect and put the video in which you will be able to hear the minister We must reflect very seriously ladies and gentlemen We can only choose to submit to this cultural offensive or react defending our convictions our tradition and our culture At this point there are no half inks because if in the face of this offensive that the Spaniards are suffering with an unprecedented state violence full of lies one gets profiled and does not oppose convictions our nation will not be able to survive and the culture of globalism and death will end up triumphing Many of you are trapped by the prevailing globalism and relativism the hour of secularism or the possibilityism that wrongly overwhelms the moral principle of lesser evil Ladies and gentlemen I have said the need to defend our convictions rather than beliefs Our party is not a confessional party but ladies and gentlemen it is not necessary to believe in God although it is very convenient to have the conviction that the value of a life is the one that must inform a fair rule of law a human society and an honest legislator Deep down ladies and gentlemen it 's a titanic struggle There are two antagonistic models who defends the basic humanism of Western culture and all others The globalist culture full of the ally of cultural Marxism and the humanist culture of Christian roots that made the West great cannot coexist in the same way that a democratic state cannot coexist with communism Ladies and gentlemen all ideologies stand up against the humanism of Christian roots Not in vain the European modernity that has given the world the democratic ideal and human rights take on the very values of its Christian heritage Nietzsche's God is dead has given way to 'we will be as gods The consideration of the person with a value in himself or herself in relation to other considerations Basically ladies and gentlemen the question is always the same rebel against the natural order against the very being of man It is the rebellion of the creature against its own creature being the abandonment of philosophical reason and truth that makes us free That is why its consequences are so serious and why for those who want to annihilate our future it is so decisive Why are they so afraid of VOX We give them a lot of fear so they insult us call us fascists extreme right and laugh We give them much fear because we have come to tell the truth and the truth bothers them bothers them creates difficulties and confronts them with their own reality because we have come to denounce that their progress is lies ladies and gentlemen that they are puppets of elites that lead us to destruction because we have come to say that abortion is to kill a human being and a drama for women and to defeat their empty slogans because we have come to say that women are left alone and that they have never been so unprotected so deceived and so lack of support and humanity because we have come to adhere to life from conception to their natural death and because we have come to protect pregnant women the natural family for the social function they perform and our children from their perversions That 's what scares them so much We scare them because their weapon is the lie and that lie succumbs to reason and word We scare them because that 's our strength We fear them because they know that we can build a nation upon the truth and that will make us indestructible Do n't ask us ladies and gentlemen none of VOX what we propose so that you can abort as if it were something good Ask us ladies and gentlemen what are we going to do so that a woman can have a child with complete freedom Then we 'll answer them We ladies and gentlemen care for and defend women we do not blame them To whom we blame it is to all of you We have come to open horizons that were hidden and this is what scares you so much We have not come to impose anything ladies and gentlemen we have come to propose that another path is possible Now it is ladies and gentlemen Now I do The introduction of the absolutely irregular right to abortion in the United States XIV amendment has fortunately been reversed although it has taken fifty years We 'll take less Faced with the culture of death VOX defends life from conception to natural extinction Thank you very much
"Ladies and gentlemen from now on in some cases it will be an honor to be considered a criminal by a government that accords and pardons terrorists and puts in jail those who are dedicated to saving lives Ladies and gentlemen something very serious is happening in this country very serious To classify as a criminal the peaceful conduct of the provided movements which consists in informing assisting comforting or praying yes praying before the abortion centers rather centres of extermination attacks seriously our rule of law and our democratic system It introduces an authoritarian conception of the criminal law of the author proper to a despotic and totalitarian government like his First it perverts the purposes of law secondly it despises the value of justice and thirdly and most importantly it violates fundamental freedoms and rights to eliminate the dissident to cancel the one who opposes his agenda and his culture of death It perverts the purposes of the law because it will condemn persons who by reacting peacefully to an unjust law such as the current abortion law in addition to its perverse effects are increased by the lack of protection of the administrations to the most vulnerable persons Any political representative who has a higher budget for abortion centres than to help pregnant women should be repugnant When a woman goes to Social Security often pressured by problems in the face of an unforeseen pregnancy all they offer is abortion the only establishment to which they derive is extermination centres That 's what should be considered a crime that 's called induced abortion and not considering people who offer consolation and humanity to women who have been destroyed after an induced abortion On the other hand this change means absolute contempt for the value of justice since instead of protecting the unborn and instead of ensuring the health of women as would be fair it favours those who profit from the elimination of human beings and risk the health of their mothers because those who want to be considered criminals who report the reality of abortion and its consequences are the centres of extermination which use deception for economic sub benefit depreciating the health of women To whom you represent is to the employer of abortion condemned in the wake of several claims by Christian lawyers for misleading advertising on their website for hiding the risks and deceiving by affirming that it is an intervention that leaves no consequences It was proven in this trial that it may have countless physical consequences or risks such as sterility mental illness or triple the risk of suicide The text we discussed is the one that the abortionist employer asked Minister Montero just the day after the publication of some photos taking a coffin of an adult from one of the centers That is why this regulation allows the centres to file complaints Therefore the complaint is not required by women who are allegedly harassed because there is not a single complaint Ladies and gentlemen do not lie there is not a single complaint It is the centers that do not want witnesses do not want those pictures of coffins that reflect death and want to work with total opacity and impunity to avoid police attestations like these In addition six thousand abortions less reduces your income by six million Thirdly this reform violates fundamental rights such as the right to freedom of expression assembly participation or religious freedom of which persons who meet near abortion centres are holders That is why we will have recourse to the Constitutional Court There is a variety of case law The right of expression cannot be restricted by any previous censorship let alone by imprisonment Different rulings of the Constitutional Court ruled that in a democratic society the urban area is not only an area of circulation but also an area of participation and that this constitutes one of the few means available to citizens to express their demands publicly They accuse such behaviour of impairing women 's freedom or privacy It is unfair to appeal to the freedom of women who are mostly pressured deceived and in an emotional state that prevents them from discerning The immense hardness of his heart makes them present abortion as a right as if it were something good to eliminate a human being But it is also very perverse because violence against women as it is happening can be exercised without any punishment You have to have a very hardened heart to send the message that the death of a child is the best choice that it is a free act to abort but that it is not the failure to do so Do n't be fooled ladies because that 's not true The only truth is that this woman when she crosses that door will let the child she carries be snatched from her bowels and that has consequences Do not deceive them ladies and gentlemen and tell them the truth before so much iniquity before so much hardness of heart only the truth that which you despise is the one that can make us all free Finally ladies and gentlemen these groups would not exist if the People 's Party had fulfilled its electoral promises of repealing the Abortion Act by repealing that wicked law or the Constitutional Court had issued a judgment as was its obligation more than eleven years ago ruling if it is faithful to the spirit of the Constitution that a unconstitutional law is being applied because it cannot be a right to eliminate a human being but must be regarded as an anti-legal act and moreover the State must protect the unborn We do not blame women we accuse you Something very serious is happening in this country ladies and gentlemen Something very serious is happening in this country when the tributes to the murderers of nearly a thousand compatriots are allowed and put in jail those who have saved more than 6,000 lives Something very serious is happening ladies and gentlemen"
Thank you very much Mr President We will vote in favour of taking this bill into account so that the time of social service that a woman will perform in her day to compute the years assessed for the purposes of partial retirement simply because it is of justice although we do not agree with the amount of stupidity that we have had to hear this afternoon They have insulted ladies and gentlemen they have insulted many women many women who worked whether or not they agreed with that moment that was lived in our country They 've insulted a lot of women who did a service to their country I am not going to go in if I agree or disagree with the Franco administration what happens is that you seem to have brought this initiative in the pure evening and simply to mess with an administration and moreover to provoke a party like VOX but we are not going to get into your provocations Ladies and gentlemen it should also be counted as a contribution to social security for the time that mothers or parents stayed or stayed to take care of their children but not because they considered it to be a heavy burden or burden but on the contrary because they considered the great social value that this represents and it should be possible to do so if the money of the Spaniards were not embezzled in derision as this government does It is contradictory and hypocritical to say that they avoid the negative gender impact according to his lexicon when they have just decreased through the Royal Decree Law 3/2021 the maternity supplement in the retirement pension for mothers with large families In other words they lower their pension penalize mothers who have had four or more children in particular to whom they have contributed most to society to whom they have been more heroic in a country where having a child has become heroic This is his progressive feminism We will table amendments to correct this injustice in the bill that is currently being dealt with By the way while in Hungary women who have had four or more children apart from other benefits are exempt from income tax because they estimate that they have contributed enough to society to pay taxes Yes it is that country in which families are so much helped which has risen its birth rate by 24 in very few years that country which in addition now presides over a woman precisely that which was dedicated to family policies that country to which you and your friends in the European Union demonise to which all consensus progresses demonizes because it is not submissive to its agenda for the destruction of women and therefore for the destruction of the family Ladies and gentlemen what seems rather to be the fact that this motion for a law is now forced by 8 March perhaps to conceal the true horror that has occurred on our streets or perhaps to disguise the division of a movement that has already degenerated in such a way that we are ashamed to share the status of woman with those who say they represent us and appear in a zafia vulgar even obscene violent aggressive way with flags of the sickle and the hammer with a staging that reminds us of other times They want to forget past times rewrite history and however evoke those who inspired by a perverse ideology such as the communist have caused dramatic effects in our country and whose consequences are now being lived in Europe By the way ladies and gentlemen 25 million women did not attend that demonstration Many of us are tired of these sophistications of hatred against man and of being treated as victims A second thought Our pension system is broken and fundamentally it is due to demographic suicide We have lost 1.1 million native Spaniards in the last ten years and it is a great fault for this that the current perverse feminism which has caused great social damage and is causing great personal and family damage a feminism that does not take into account an important part of the female specificity such as motherhood that it has wanted to free itself wrongly from its own nature following the old slogans already ladies and gentlemen old fashioned of Simone de Beauvoir that sex and motherhood enslave it Women have never been as slave as they are today the absolute impossibility of having the children they want the risk of losing their jobs if you become pregnant companies that offer the freezing of eggs because they cannot dispense with work at the most productive age abortion as a solution you have problems to have your child the barbarity of the rental belly the increase of trafficking for sexual exploitation Ladies and gentlemen women have shown that in their professional development they have at least the same capacity as men but ladies and gentlemen unaided conciliation is still the pending subject and many women have left many important things on the way Only in view of the equal value of women and the absolute differences with men can justice be done The woman would have to be a partner of the man in absolute equality of value and in the absolute difference of being in a culture that denies the value of difference according to Mariolina Ceriotti Finally let us reflect on the sustainability of the pension system In the face of a broken pension system the only solution for you is immigration and euthanasia One of the pillars in a distribution system is without a doubt birth Protection of the family and encouragement of the birth of children should be a priority Ladies and gentlemen EUR 21 300 million could be devoted to many urgent needs including supporting the family but this government which brings us misery and ruin decides that it is the gender perspective that must consume EUR 21 300 million EUR 21 300 million to combat hegemonic masculinities How are they going to explain to the Spaniards that now with the spectacular rise of gasoline half of what they pay is tax How are they going to explain that EUR 21 300 million which is what is collected in two years by the gas tax is earmarked for gender policies How do they explain to the Spaniards that the rise of light and gas makes them poorer and the state richer because it collects more with the rise of those taxes
Ladies and gentlemen of the Government 's political group this bill is about justice and we will support it but it is not going to hide its inaction in the face of a broken pension system it is not going to hide its offenses and its contempt for all the Spaniards
the Spaniards go out on the 19th of March
With venial Mr. President This is an initiative of the Republican and Bildu parliamentary groups presented in the Senate which comes from that House where it has already been taken into consideration but whose content is essentially coincident with other previous legislative proposals debated in September 2021 and October 2020 at the respective initiative of Podemos and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya initiatives which also postulate the repeal of articles 490.3 491 and 543 of the Criminal Code on insults and slanders to the king and outrages to Spain Then since 2019 among initiatives of communist groups and separatist groups the suppression of such crimes against the head of State and against Spain once a year is discussed in this House What an unpatriotic perseverance You remind me for these purposes so alien to any civilized order of coexistence of Gustavo the Incongruent character of Gomez de la Serna who defended a doctoral thesis consisting of the right of everyone to do whatever he wanted You believe that you have the right to say in insulting or slanderous terms what you want of the king of Spain as head of state and to outrage which is a term with a semantic content of serious offense not a slight offense to Spain If you believe that this is consistent with I repeat a civilized order of coexistence you have either really lost your mind or fall into this ridiculous character of our best literature Knowing this it is to be seen that on this occasion and after the previous two there is a significant change and it is that on the previous occasions these gentlemen who sit on this side of the House of the Socialist Party have opposed it But now curiously I do not know whether for a reason of spring that blood alters in May 2022 they voted in favour of taking this proposal into consideration whose amendments we are all debating at today 's sitting On the previous occasion he took the word of Mrs Isaura Leal who is listening to me carefully I think and to whom I take the opportunity to always greet respectfully and adhere to her position of opposition to that initiative which today became enthusiasm for a senator of the Socialist Group I do n't know if there 's really a spring seasonal solstice motive here I do n't know what to think anymore I think there is a much simpler explanation and it is that the table was approaching that of the dialogue that you so much like Well they like it I do n't know if they like it or not They like what the dialogue table and its agreements also anti-patriotic provide What they like is that instrument for Mr Sánchez to continue in La Moncloa There is no clause on this in such agreements There is a general clause in one of them in the first on strengthening fundamental rights in short a vaporous ethereal thing almost constitutional lyric but that we all know that among other things it covers or protects these purposes as I say recalcitrant of these groups that are clearly contrary to the constitutional order as we all know because they manifest it so every five minutes I imagine what was the dialogue not the dialogue at the table in which the Minister of Propaganda Mr Bolaños participated the dialogue that had to be established perhaps by phone or by WhatsApp or what I know by what means with La Moncloa and with his inhabitant who is the head of the Minister of Propaganda I will not say what I said on another occasion is not that someone gets shocked Esquerra Republicana and its partners by the way I think you have broken the government pact it seems I do not know if this will serve anything for Spain we will see in the next few days let us trust that it will you would say We want to insult and slander the king freely we want to freely outrage Spain ad libitum without fees without limitation And Sanchez 's answer on the other side of the phone or whatever the means of transmission of the communication would be It would take more We could get this far But you will have seen that someone intends to prevent and on top of it to prosecute criminally that he insults and slanders the king and that he insults Spain Of course Sure Let 's support them We 've already supported them Trust us We 've said it in May in the Senate And then already with the Journal of Sessions we would be told Do not put it in the agreement that if it is already there in writing collected as a record in the Journal of Sessions of the Senate This goes into the suffo genre because it has no basis but being suffo at the same time it is serious because it is supported by the Government And if the government supports it what 's going to happen here Mrs. Isaura and the socialist spokesman Don Patxi Are you going to support him too here in this House now All the arguments that derail the proposition 's explanatory statement are not entirely false arguments to tell the truth with a certain intellectual honesty but partly false then in any case by that biased partial fallacies The judgement in the Stern and Roura case against Spain was invoked by the proposed law I have already said in some previous intervention on the occasion of those failed considerations that this sentence had not been pronounced in rigour on these criminal types it had been pronounced on the existence of a speech of hatred in the burning of a portrait of the King of Spain in Catalonia as a manifestation of freedom of expression so there was no pronouncement on this which you say is unequivocal about that they should be repealed That 's not true The judgment was also expressed in very casuistic terms i.e. very attentive to the circumstances i.e. the burning of the portrait Made of its reprehensible because it is a serious offense to the Lord who burns himself even if it is in his image although we do not know if you would have wished a burning in a pyre this is already another day if you want to tell us because your frenzy coup is considerable In a few years you have given two coups d'état you like it as soon as you have an opportunity you do It was a political manifestation in these terms it was an excess but the court somehow excuses it but no it does not agree with what you say You also cite the Otegi judgment in which it is true that it was said that the reputation of the head of state does not have to be protected in principle in a way superior to the reputation of other people But watch out for the Otegi sentence because you guys are hiding Always with lies ahead this is the guiding principle of your performance If you start lying about the history of Catalonia imagine what you are going to say about the Spanish monarchy Then lies without limits It says the amendment to the whole of Citizens that the Otegi ruling says that there is criticism of the figure of the head of state what is not to be insulted or slandered which is what you want You want to insult and slander freely because you do not like it because you consider what I know that it is the protagonist of an oppression and things of these This criterion that of the Otegi judgment was the same as that adopted by the Constitutional Court in a judgement subsequent to that of Otegi in Judgment 177/2015 before the existence of the Stern and Roura judgment Exactly the same i.e. freedom of expression protects a criticism of the head of State what is not to be insulted slandered and of course not to be outraged by Spain among other things because these types of protection are not the person of the head of State but rather what it represents which in Spanish law is the State itself the national unity and the permanence of that State article 56.1 and protects the institutions the Constitutional Court also says as a representation of what is Spain The comparative law does not give you any reason the comparative law I also had the opportunity to express it in previous speeches allows us to observe that in the republican France there is still the offence of insulting the head of State with the same penalty of fine as that which punishes insults to ministers or deputies In the republican Italy with four crimes of political vilipendio the president of the republic the republic the nation and the flag There is a 1964 Constitutional Court ruling that declared the type of 290 constitutional which is the vilipendium of the republic Other European republics of the Union Bulgaria Germany Greece Poland Portugal and Malta also include types with this scope and content By the way Mr. Asens left him for a liar I do n't see him today I 'm sorry but I would have wanted to ask Newtral who is very close to all of you a manipulator who makes truths the doer of truth like that absolute being
When he said no that this was exclusive to Spain Newtral said fake new in Mr. Asens mouth And the parliamentary monarchies that of the Netherlands Sweden Denmark Belgium and the Principality of Monaco to add a note if you want festive at that festival of nonsense that you present once again
With all due respect Your Honor This bill presented by the Joint Group the Foro Asturias party reforming article 50 of the Organic Law of the Constitutional Court addresses an important issue as has already been highlighted here And it is addressed by a member of a regionalist party I am referring to him not to his formation that at the moment there are avatars that we cannot share in VOX Mr Martínez Oblanca that the formula and the signature and that always from a regionalist option he has shown in this House his rejection of centrifugal excesses his wisdom his measure his sanity and his patriotism and I can say the same about the deputies of the Union of the Navarro People This means that regionalism is possible in Spain without falling into independence options or in options contrary to the constitutional order in general It can therefore be said that there are parties that respond faithfully to article 6 of the Constitution not like the other parties that challenge any intellectual category and the well known classifications of Max Weber or Michels parties of notables mass parties patronizing parties ideological parties clientele parties parties of social or economic interest and doctrinal parties that defend political and moral ideas We already know that in Spain perhaps because of our claim of originality I do n't know or because of an excess of chastity we could distinguish between the pedigree parties those who ask incontinently who ask for many things among them money and that appeases them in their centrifugal rage read PNV Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya and other separatist parties the parties that we could call criminals not because they act as such but because they support constituent acts of crime
Well parties that have supported and support the commission of crimes in the recent past and in the not so recent past and that we trust that they will not do so in the present or in the future although we are very afraid that they can return to the steps Then there are the inane parties that is the useless the empty those who do nothing in emergency situations We also know what they are I will not say so as not to offend anyone but they will feel identified And then according to Michels there would be the doctrinal or ideological parties among which VOX and Mr Martínez Oblanca would certainly be among them This proposal is important because in fact it does remedy albeit not sufficiently the problem of non-admission of amparo resources The problem of non-admission of amparo remedies is such that as stated in the explanatory statement 97 of the amparo remedies in 2020 the year in which that text was submitted were not allowed to proceed through an unreasoned measure This is what is intended to remedy this proposal of law as it requests that the non-admission be by a resolution motivated by the form of self But this is not enough because what VOX proposed almost at the same time as this proposed law by means of a non-law proposal was that the ordinary remedy of amparo is regulated which is the main remedy of amparo established by article 53.2 of the Constitution and that for forty four years it is said soon People 's Party Socialist Party and all the forces represented in this House have decided not to regulate So all there is is a constitutional amparo remedy with this rate of non-admission that makes it practically meaningless for any justiciable and for the professionals of the forum It is a resource conceived as a subsidiary in the same article 53.2 an omission that has no explanation but which shows that to this terrible bipartisanism that has devastated Spain with the collaboration of many present PNV Catalan nationalists when they were not net independenceists etc. it does not like the protection of fundamental rights Moreover it does not matter absolutely anything or very little as we are seeing Finally as has been said here I will repeat that today is a bad day Mr Martínez Oblanca I am sorry or a good day what I know for us to discuss this issue because today is a sad day If a year ago in November 2021 on the day that PP and PSOE agreed to the renewal of the Constitutional Court by electing four judges I said that it was a sad very sad day today I must say that I am exhausted to say how sad it is this day because the Government has decided as was otherwise foreseeable to appoint two judges of the court with a net party profile a former government minister and a former director general of the Ministry of the Presidency Net partisanship in the profiles of these appointees which once again demonstrates what we already know that is that the Government does not believe in the Constitution at all that the Government is willing to violate it under any circumstances and by any means and that in order for all its constitutional violations to be blessed it has proposed to the Constitutional Court these two names so that where appropriate when they have to prosecute unconstitutionality remedies the Constitutional Court does not declare the initiatives appealed as unconstitutional and therefore the Spanish law continues to be fed by unconstitutional rules It is further evidence of the bipartisan vices of the party in this case that destroy the political regime of 1978
With the venom The opinion of the United Nations Human Rights Committee of 12 July 2022 published in August is not binding on Spain as is no opinion of that body as the Supreme Court has affirmed until exhaustion Do not be led by the mirage of the judgment of 17 July 2018 of that court which has held that such an opinion may be the basis for an action for claim of patrimonial liability for abnormal functioning of justice Because in the case prosecuted by that sentence it was that the actor had reported to the court up to forty seven times the risk of her daughter 's death at the hands of her ex-husband or person with whom she lived without meriting proper guardianship of the judiciary and despite psychological expert reports
reports from social services etc Then nothing comparable to the prosecution that is the subject of this opinion which as I say does not oblige Spain in terms of non-compliance unless there is a provision of domestic law which establishes this and it is not the case in Spain On the recommendations addressed to Spain by Resolution 2381/2021 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe based on the so called Civics report the name of the Latvian deputy vice president of the democratic and green socialists in that parliamentary assembly it is falsely said in the motion of the Republican Left of Catalonia that this resolution was already under consideration at the last session of the Parliamentary Assembly in June this year It is said falsely because what is omitted is that this resolution was not adopted but that it fell expressly at the will of the proposer himself the picturesque Member Mr Cilevics who seems to be very interested in the Catalan and Spanish affairs because of a number of successful amendments some Members who I see sitting here from the Socialist Group were present to delete all the references to Spain and only the references to the Republic of Turkey remain Then he cheats on us or pretends to cheat on us but as you see he does n't hang I was present in that picturesque vote promoted by such a picturesque parliamentarian of a Baltic republic In the light of the above it is questionable whether ERC will be equally jealous of compliance with international law for example whether the Court of Justice of the European Union following the conclusions of Advocate General Richard De la Tour of 14 July 2022 i.e. before yesterday cannot deny the execution of a European arrest warrant on a ground based on the national law of the requested State as well as cannot deny such execution solely on the basis of a review of the jurisdiction of the examining judge of the requesting State nor can it deny the execution of the European arrest warrant on the basis of a hypothetical unfair trial that would be instituted by virtue of the execution of the arrest warrant unless it says in the general conclusions it has objective reliable accurate and duly updated data proving that there is a real risk of a violation of the fundamental right to a fair trial due to systemic deficiencies things that do not exist in the case of Spanish law What will be the position of the Government of the Generality
Thank you What will be the position of the Government of the Generality if the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union follows the conclusions of the Advocate General and therefore determines that the refusal of the execution of the arrest warrant in the Puig i Gordi case and eventually in that of Mr Puigdemont and others is contrary to European law What 's it gonna be We suppose that we oppose Belgium 's handing over Puigdemont Puig i Gordi and others to Spain to the Spanish courts to be tried or at best they take advantage of the circumstance to sacrifice them now that the ERC's with Junts are misled and they want to put an end to the glorious existence their nationalist fervour and their veneration of international legality The national Government had to sue the Kingdom of Belgium after the judgment of 7 June 2021 of the Brussels Court of Appeal which refused the extradition of Puig i Gordi to sue the Court of Justice of the European Union under Article 259 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union after complaint to the Commission But what can be expected of a Government like this which signed in July 2022 a pact at that table of disgusting dialogue in which it says that it supports Catalan law
that it has prevented the forced execution because there was already a car of the judgment of the TSJ of 2020 that the only thing it says is that children must be educated in the two official languages in the Catalan education system in a percentage that will be determined but that it can not be less than 25 of each of those languages You the Socialist Parliamentary Group following these independenceists refuse
that Spanish children in Catalonia are educated in a vehicular language as the Constitutional Court has said with a minimum teaching time of 25 Indignity and oppression Nothing more
With the venom This GNP addresses a question of the greatest moral gravity such as that of sexual abuse in childhood and adolescence which should not we consider be the subject of political treatment in the worst sense of this term namely that which is circumstantially suitable for political parties We start from the disgust they cause and the punishment that these abusive behaviors deserve as well as from the suffering and pain of the victims but we believe that the proposing groups and the rest of the House groups will share with us that these criminal behaviors must be judged by the judges who have done so and will do so in accordance with the criminal laws In order to veto that they are not tried on the basis of the statute of limitations the applicable rules have been amended to delay the initial limitation period which has recently been done on the occasion of the processing of the Organic Act on the Comprehensive Protection of Children and Adolescents a law to which VOX objected although it voted in favour of the reform of article 132.1 third paragraph of the Criminal Code on this matter which extended the statute of limitations on the basis of the determination of die to quo from the age of thirty five years if the victim has suffered abuse when he was a minor and when he died before that age from the date of death Moreover in the legal sphere we have some difficulty because of this proposal for a law and it is this strange recourse to the Ombudsman The Ombudsman is in accordance with article 54 of the Constitution a commissioner of the General Courts for the defence of the rights recognized in the first title textually stating the precept for the purpose of which he may supervise the activity of the Administration The Catholic Church is not a public administration in Spain nor does it form part of the public organization unlike in some secular State whose democratic character cannot be doubted such as for example the Federal Republic of Germany which is so because the Fundamental Law of Bonn in force refers to the precepts of the Constitution of Weimar articles 136 to 141 establishing in 136.5 that it will be public corporations that were in the past in homage to a national tradition of signposting In addition the German constitutional jurisprudence has wanted to emphasize that this character of public law corporation of the most relevant churches or churches among others the Catholic one is due to serve general interests in education in the field of spiritual assistance in general of hospital assistance of assistance to the most needy etc. the same can be said about what is happening in the Austrian Republic The latter leads us to wonder why this initiative has no limits either in time or in space How long do you think I 'm investigating the Ombudsman Only in Spain Until the constitution of the Church And curiously intended exclusively for the Church This is a sort of law of historical memory and or democratic memory in ecclesiastical terms clearly guided by similar politically unacceptable purposes and we are not surprised that you defended it in this rostrum on behalf of the Socialist Group Mrs Calvo Poyato who is the queen of democratic and other memory laws as is known Why are abuses not investigated in the educational sphere in general not only in the Catholic confessional Because you will not deny that there have been them and unfortunately there will be them Why is it not researched in the sport field Why is it not researched in the artistic field In all of them the existence of abuse is notorious You 'll tell me not minors Minors and non-minors on the basis of what happens in each circumstance Why is the State responsible for some of these areas not investigating itself Well we do n't know You the proposing groups need to shut up about your relationship with the Catholic Church in the past which is a criminal or collaborative relationship with crime I refer to the republican governments of Largo Caballero and Negrin in which by the way Manuel de Irujo of the Basque Nationalist Party participated Finally the Catholic Church contrary to what has been said here has already commissioned a study to investigate the abuses that have been committed by clergy and religious to a law firm in Madrid We trust that this office will carry out this study and we also trust that as a result of this study the Catholic Church will fully repair to the extent possible
With all due respect Madam President Before I make an orderly statement of the reasons for our opposition to this proposal for organic law I will make some reference to the things I have just heard A spokesman a Catalan independenceist who I cannot identify by his name will forgive me but Catalan independenceists are like repeated chromes all he said crude argument the principle of criminal legality Burdo argument has said this gentleman I suppose he has not studied Law and if he has studied it I suppose he will not exercise any legal profession because of course I do not know what would be the fate of his clients Another has said nostalgia of the dictatorship I interpret that referring to VOX and PP or PP and VOX Well we have no nostalgia for any dictatorship what you do have and profess is love for the dictatorships present as you credit every day with your support for the Castro Bolivarian and whatever dictatorships of the communist world are and remain A third I think it was Mr Asens said that there are no half inks here No they do n't fit And what do you tell me Mr Asens that it has had to be a Commission of the European Parliament which in 2022 your report has not yet been published will urge the Kingdom of Spain to investigate the crimes of the ETA that have not been investigated or tried Has this forgotten you along the way The three the four already the five are forgotten by the way the sixty million dead killed by the Maoist Republic of China sixty million Neither are these What kind of ink are these the average the red the blue or what Or the twenty million of the Soviet Union this does not seem to you to be relevant either Well the intention of this bill is a political political intention of all its proponents including surprisingly the Basque Nationalist Party the Basque Nationalist Party which as I said last week participated in the government of the Popular Front that emerged from the fraudulent elections of February 1936 in the person of Manuel Irujo Yeah I remind you in case you do not know that Irujo made it a condition for his participation in his party to put an end to religious repression in Spain religious repression that has given rise according to the documented study that dates back to 1961 by Antonio Montero to 6832 murders of clergy and religious Do n't these get in the inks either Mr. Asens What kind of ink are they black by the caskets Or what ink is this black by the red of the shed blood It is a shame that you come to say these things here you can say them in your rallies with the intention of deceiving your voters who in good faith or naively can believe it here you would not have to have the shame of saying these things because some of us know some of the history of Spain of course more than you no doubt and not with that sectarian spirit that characterizes you Mr De Irujo Don Manuel who rested in peace on January 9 1937 presented his memorandum in the Council of Ministers still chaired by Largo Caballero about religious repression in a very harsh tone I have here texts that reproduce or transcribe the written words that he presented at that meeting of the Council and demanded an end to this religious persecution The Council of Ministers unanimously opposed and Mr De Irujo did not resign not only did he not resign but he agreed to participate in a government as criminal as the previous one which was that of Dr Negrin since May 1937 So the Basque Nationalist Party as I said last week also needs to shut up on this issue and should not adhere to such ignominious propositions But besides the intention there is the realization and the realization must be judged according to the intention according to Ortega of the literary work in The Viewer And here the realization is legally impossible and I will explain it briefly Spain acceded in 1968 to the 1948 United Nations Convention on Genocide and in 1971 reformed its Criminal Code during the Franco regime to introduce the crime of genocide under the terms of the convention The terms of the convention and the Penal Code thus drafted under that 1971 reform as well as the 1995 Penal Code of the democratic period the work of the Socialist Party Mr González ruled and Mr Belloch was Minister of Justice a magistrate collected the crime of genocide as well as what they called crimes of the law of peoples That text had subsequently been reformed and it had been maintained that persecution to be classified as genocide must be national racial ethnic or religious not political Political persecution would only be a crime against humanity now in force in the Criminal Code but it is not possible to judge even in accordance with what you claim to be a standard of customary international law facts that have taken place during Francoism or during the first years of the Transition because such invocation of customary international criminal law today is not possible under the unequivocal fact that such criminal law is already codified at least partially since the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court of 1998
text that admits no exception to the prohibition of retroactivity of criminal laws Then you claim with this reform concluded in a second Madam President that it can be judged in Spain according to an aberrant precept which could not be judged as a crime by the International Criminal Tribunal itself Thank you
Thank you With the venom Mrs. Moro Almaraz yesterday Mrs. Pastor came down from the co-governance donkey Sánchez 's interested fantasy after more than a year in which you have been talking about her in terms of unwavering adherence You starting with Mr. Married and following Mrs. Cuca But fortunately that accession has broken and then I think I can see that our teachings against that pilgrim ideation have not been in vain Now you insist again on the law of pandemics which is like a nervous tic of Mr. Married that you repeat I tell you with the utmost affection what striped record and that we have to amend by opposing that point four of your motion Everything you say about doctrinal and jurisprudential authorities is not true nor is your quotation distorted by the opinion of the Council of State you have quoted I will read to you what the judgment of the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of 14 September 2021 says The normative coverage of the measures that the health authorities consider urgent and necessary for public health and imply limitation or restriction of fundamental rights is found in the health legislation in particular in the Organic Law 3/1986 on Special Measures in the Field of Public Health in the General Law on Health and in the General Law on Public Health You should be aware of this sentence and your group as well and you should stop changing the name of that ridiculous plan B that all you intended was to reform a line of one paragraph of an article of a law with purely exploratory scope for this now megalomaniac pretentious and crazy pandemic law name Moreover for this group it is somewhat inconclusive that Sánchez is a despot a despot in the sense of Tocqueville who says of the despot that he is the one who while considering the excellence of freedom only wants it for himself Or in more classic terms if you want he is a tyrant in Plato 's terms in his Gorgias dialogue Since someone has to rule the city either acts tyrannically or on the contrary is a follower of the legitimate constitution This is Sanchez But Sánchez 's attacks which as you have said are concentrated in less than a year and have given rise to five rulings by the Constitutional Court that leave him in this ignominious figure of the despot or tyrant are ways that his party fights timidly and partially without conviction Only the determination of VOX has succeeded in discrediting them through the above mentioned rulings of the Constitutional Court However today we propose to approve a motion that relates to and complains about such abuses and abuses and you reproach yourselves in reciprocity with the Socialist Party that of the election of the members of the General Council of the Judiciary or of its blockade that of your mismanagement in the matter of the health crisis or of the lack of cooperation that the PSOE reproaches you in an extraordinary situation that of the prison policies that the PSOE practices while being led by the Government by Sánchez and that you says the Socialist Party and rightly so which you also practiced in the governments that you led etc All these accusations and mutual reproaches are circumstantial and contingent because the substantive reality is very different it is another The substantive reality is that you agree on the issues of Spanish politics and you do so despite the fact that it is a convergence that has cost you 5 800 000 votes since 2011 and 4 400 000 votes since 2008 to the Socialist Party You have lost 50 of your electoral balance and the Socialist Party has lost 40 However they are recalcitrant they do not react they are slaves to that 2030 Agenda which is an affront to all Spaniards because the only thing they pursue is because of ideological objectives the depopulation of the nation In addition you have practiced during the government of Mariano Rajoy the same fiscal policy that Mr Sánchez has practiced since 2019 to lower growth greater fiscal effort It is a disappointment that it is not in the head except of inepts who are what you are as you have just recently remembered the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 22 January which said that Mr Montoro 's reform on model 720
does not respond to compelling reasons of general interest and is also extremely repressive Not to mention that of 2014 in the matter of imputation in income of surplus profits resulting from real estate transmissions in which the reductions due to time and also the corrections due to the increase in the price of the money were abolished Nothing more and thank you very much
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The representative of Esquerra referred earlier to the poem of Salvador Puig Antich about which silence did not gag his name Silence has gagged the memory of Mrs. de Esquerra who forgot that he was executed not because he was an anarchist but because he had killed a policeman The policeman was Francisco Anguas and was twenty four years old I imagine you recognize him because he spoke many times from this rostrum It is of course José Calvo Sotelo He was killed by socialist policemen who that same night tried to kill also José MaríaGil Robles but they did not find him at his home In other words in this regime that its law presents as a luminous democracy destroyed by fascism law enforcement officials killed opposition leaders By the way Calvo Sotelo does not count as a victim for the purposes of this law because his period of application starts on July 18 and he was killed on July 13 With this skillful cornering of the times they manage to ignore the 3,000 victims of political violence of the period 1931 1936 a violence starred mostly by the left and in which stand out the 1400 dead of the evil so called Revolution of Asturias in fact failed attempt of socialist coup d'état against the previous electoral victory of the right That revolution was led by Francisco Largo Caballero and Indalecio Prieto among others which has not prevented both of them from having statues in the New Ministries Another socialist the great Julián Besteiro then said to them You will come to power if you arrive soaked and red in blood This is a law that VOX will repeal if it comes to the government By the way it is a pity that the People 's Party with an absolute majority does not derogate from the previous law it is a pity that the People 's Party does not repeal the Andalusian law of equivalent content today We will repeal it because it is a law worthy of Orwell and Orwell wrote in his book 1984 The party could extend its hand to the past and say that such or such event had never occurred This was much more horrible than torture and death so far the date And in fact erasing the victims of conservative Spain 's media from public memory is like killing them for the second time No one in this whole session has yet talked about the victims killed by the Popular Front in the 1930s So I 'm going to remind you of some deaths that according to your law never happened He 's less known he 's Florentino Asensio"
He was Bishop of Barbastro in 1936 and on July 22 those who in your opinion defended democracy cut off his testicles and left him bleeding for a whole night He died forgiving his murderers we bring him here as a representative of the 6800 priests and nuns and tens of thousands of segros killed by whom in your opinion they defended democracy and human rights This is Melquiades Alvarez They will recognize you because there is a bust of yours in the hallway and it is that you presided over this House He founded the Liberal Democratic Republican Party but his republican status did not save him from being killed by Republicans in Model Prison By the way of the eight ministers of the Republic killed in the Civil War seven were killed by the Popular Front The deaths of Alvarez and Asensio do fall within the time frame covered by the rule but their exclusion from the status of victims is determined by the manicheo approach of the explanatory statement in whose light the law must be interpreted a explanatory statement explaining that the Republican side represented democracy and human rights and how could the good people 's side commit any crime The understanding underlying the whole law is that victims must by definition be left wing and right wing victims For all this this is a totalitarian law not only because of the way it divides the Spaniards and their ancestors into good and bad but also because of the way it seeks to suppress the natural diversity of opinions on historical issues In a free country citizens are free to reach their own views on history on the basis of their own readings In a free country historians are free to disagree You seek to suppress this plurality by imposing by decree a sectarian historical account But they are also going to pass this law by the hand of Bildu and Bildu has demanded the extension of the period of application until 1983 You are batasunization the memory you are assuming the historical account of the extreme left a story according to which the Transition did not really exist the Transition would have been nothing more than a continuation of Francoism by other means and what is more serious the 388 murders committed by the ETA between 1976 and 1983 would become interpretable as democratic resistance to Francoist governments of Adolfo Suárez or Felipe González Article 4 of the law states that the law is based on the right to moral reparation of the losers the losers of 1939 We believe that the vanquished side has already been restored to its rights by numerous laws of the 1970s and 1980s Military graduations right to pensions buildings were returned to the unions and left wing parties There was a true reconciliation prepared by gestures of concord from decades ago For example the declaration of the Communist Party of Spain in 1956 in favour of reconciliation between the Spanish or the approach given by the Franco regime to the celebration of the twenty five years of peace in 1964
It was a non-sectarian approach an approach that does not emphasize victory or war but the twenty five years of later peace and prosperity As for the Valley of the Fallen which we do not know if you intend to destroy or merely resignify well it does not need resignification because from the beginning it was a monument not to the Franco victory but to the last twinning of the fallen on both sides beyond death That is why it is not presided over by a statue of Franco what presides over the monument is not a statue of Franco it is a cross Ladies and gentlemen 146 of our predecessors who occupied these same seats were killed in the Civil War 75 were killed by the People 's Front 71 were killed by the national side to which would have to be added 33 executed in the post war processes On their behalf we ask you not to pass this law Do n't resurrect a cainism that cost us so much We will recover the spirit of the Transition
that it was a spirit of mutual forgiveness and not revenge VOX for its part will support any initiatives of homage of recognition to the fallen on both sides who died pursuing what they considered a better Spain as well as to the victims of political and religious persecution without distinction of ideologies and sides which this law does not do Thank you President
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen In 1974 a year before Franco 's death Dolores Ibarruri the Passionary gave an interview to a French magazine There he said the following We have waited for 39 years we may have to wait for some more but I promise you that after our revenge will last 40 voices 40 years This 40 times 40 reminds me of the thousand year old Reich thing does n't it But what I want to say to you gentlemen of the left is that initiatives like the one you bring us today seem to give fulfillment to the Passionary 's promise because they are not inspired by compassion but by the desire for revenge the need to rewrite Orwellian history and the pathological claim to win at last the Civil War after 83 years of its end That 's why we 're going to vote against it We will always vote against initiatives of historical hemipléjica memory that pay tribute only to the dead of one side while ignoring the other In fact the purpose of such initiatives is not to pay tribute to the dead but to fix in the minds of all Spaniards an equation that says Right Killer Left Victim By the way the reconstruction of the facts they include in their GNP leaves much to be desired I recommend reading the definitive work on the fall of Malaga and La Desbandá which has been written by the Professor of Contemporary History of the University of Malaga Antonio Nadal who has devoted 30 years of his career to researching those facts For example why do n't you tell us what happened in Malaga in the months preceding the capture of the city by Franco 's troops when Malaga was at the mercy of militias of the Popular Front who murdered 3406 people according to the meticulous account of Angel David Martín Rubio for the mere fact of being Catholic or right wing They did not burn any church because they had all been burned in May 1931 Well eight thousand of those militiamen eight thousand militiamen fled to Almería on the Malaga road as Franco 's troops mixed with civilian populations approached That 's not what I 'm saying or Nadal 's saying This is stated in the report containing the conclusions of the investigation conducted by the Government of the Republic itself after the fall of Malaga The report speaks of deaths from hunger deaths from exhaustion Interestingly there 's no talk of bombing deaths In other words La Desbandá seems to have consisted basically of a great humanitarian catastrophe motivated by the logistical unprevision of the republican side In fact the apocalyptic version of La Desbandá as a deliberate massacre is based on the testimony of a single person the communist doctor Norman Bethune who has been evoked here several times who was not on the road he was in Almeria that is at the point of destination by the way he was expelled from the Red Cross years later for dishonest behavior towards the nurses But let us imagine that you were right and that indeed the Francoist side had committed war crimes against the refugees by bombing the road We stand out from you in admitting the crimes on both sides Why do n't they make initiatives that embrace our sides that include the victims of both sides If they did we would be willing to try to believe that they do so by seeking peace piety forgiveness and not sectarianism In this sense I make a suggestion to you Why do they not declare a place of democratic memory in addition to the Malaga road the ravine of Can Trinxet There passed in February 1939 another withdrawal the definitive after Franco took Barcelona and a column of militiamen who guarded forty two prisoners on the national side was stopped in this ravine on February 9 1939 The French border was already very close the war was already lost to the Republican side and they could have taken them to French territory and freed them there But no the militiamen preferred to shoot the forty two prisoners among them were the bishop of Teruel Anselmo Polanco and the military commander of Teruel Colonel Rey d'Harcourt Any initiative that consists in using the dead almost ninety years ago and only those on one side to turn them into the political weapon of the present is nothing more than to sow hatred again among Spaniards and they will never count on us to support this Thank you very much
with Mr Matía the President of Down Spain who will explain how Down syndrome is disappearing in Spain or with Professor Villaroig who wrote in an interview that people with Down syndrome enjoy great protection after birth but before birth almost no one supports them We do support them because we defend the right to life of all including the disabled
"Thank you Madam President The consolidated budget of the Ministry of Presidency will increase from 354 million to 481 million an increase of more than a third It is expected in a Government that considers increasing public spending to be an end in itself but it is a disaster for a country that has broken an absolute historical record of public debt We have already overcome the billion and a half euro barrier which is equivalent to 117 of our GDP and is going to be an unbearable slab that we will leave on our children 's shoulders The government presidency expenditure line is multiplied by 2.7 from 51 million to 134 million This is partly related to the increase in staff expenditure from 34 million to 38 million and also to the increase in the number of personal advisers appointed to the finger by the President of the Government from 441 million to 483 million We have the world 's best advised President of the Government It is true that a large part of this increase almost tripled in the government 's Presidency budget is related to the Presidency of the European Union which will be held in Spain in 2023 We hope that this presidency will be exercised with dignity but now we are very much afraid that the President of the Government wants to turn the occasion into a platform for his personal promotion in view of his possible landing in an international body when he has lost the next elections and this is something we cannot afford We cannot allow European milestones to be converted into an international launch ramp for Mr Sánchez or into a stage for the representation of his personal ideological obsessions about feminism climate fanaticism or democratic memory because in the departure for the European Presidency there is a specific section on the dissemination of the principles of democratic memory We are going to give memory lessons to our European partners Since we are talking about this the total budget for democratic memory policies rises from 11.8 million to 13.9 million euros i.e. almost 14 million invested in falsification of history in demonisation of the conservative Spanish media and in reopening of the wounds that were already closed Because indeed socialist gentlemen you are succeeding in rekindling hatred in the great grandchildren of the generation who lived the Civil War that your great grandparents and grandparents had buried many decades ago The story you want to record in the minds of young people is a Manichean fable and the proof is that you hide the crimes of which you consider your side In the fifty five pages of the endless Law on Democratic Memory there is not a single word nor a single sentence devoted to the approximately 60,000 people killed on the left between 1936 and 1939 By erasing them from memory you are killing them morally for the second time By the way these crimes took place under the authority of two presidents of the socialist government Francisco Largo Caballero and Juan Negrin The first of them retains his proud statue in New Ministries while you dig up Queipo de Llano and prepare to dig up José Antonio Primo de Rivera who was murdered by the left after a farce trial By the way many of these deaths took place under the symbol of the sickle and the hammer that the deputy of Podemos proudly displayed in this rostrum yesterday and again the deputy of Podemos has once again claimed the Communist Party a moment ago As among the activities generously financed by the law of memory is the monumentalization of what you call places of memory I will make you Minister some constructive proposals For example they declare a place of memory Paracellos del Jarama where 5,000 people were killed on the left The Model Prison was declared a memorial site where hundreds of political prisoners were killed including several ministers and deputies of the Republic They erected a monolith in the Pías de Barbastro Schools where the fifty one Claretian seminarians were locked up and then shot and erected a similar monument in Caspe where they ran the same ninety one people for the crime of being Catholic By the way these crimes were ordered by the Regional Defence Council of Aragon an anarchist body in which the famous assassin and assailant of international banks reigned Buenaventura Durruti whom Don Gabriel Rufián openly claimed yesterday on Twitter Dismantle the shameful monument to Durruti that exists in Leon They dismantle the numerous monuments to Lluís Companies whose Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias of Catalonia was responsible for some 8,000 executions in Catalonia of the Popular Front And they declare as a memorial the Cape Major of Santander that 40 metre high cliff from where the militiamen took so many victims But these budgets still surprise us it is a departure for and I quote textually the creation of a technical commission for the study of cases of human rights violations against people for their struggle for the consolidation of democracy fundamental rights and democratic values between the entry into force of the 1978 Constitution and 31 December 1983 Let us be clear we are talking about investigating alleged police abuses committed in the fight against ETA and GRAPO in those years of the Transition This means that the government seems to consider that the ETA and GRAPO were fighting for democracy and human rights and not for the secession of the Vasco Country and the establishment there of a communist dictatorship Such was the democratic zeal of the ETA that killed 383 people between 1976 and 1983 including socialist militant Germán González killed in 1979 in Villarreal de Urrechu"
By extending the period of application of the law of memory until 1983 you are buying the historical account of Podemos and Bildu according to which there was no real transition and therefore we do not yet have a true democracy True democracy presumably will come when we abolish the monarchy and replace it with a confederal republic of Iberian nations with the right of self determination Thank you
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Our position on this motion is going to be abstention and we think it is a good idea to encourage the settlement of civil servants in rural areas through the empowerment of teleworking This motion however leaves too many loose ends Telework also has its contraindications There has been talk of hermit syndrome that is the emotional and professional isolation of the worker The target of up to four days per week of teleworking seems unrealistic to us But let us be honest the main reason why this motion does not finish convincing us is that settling some officials in empty Spain is not going to be exactly the solution to our demographic disaster The recent study on the ageing of the staff of the General Administration of the State published in 2012 concludes that the average age of the Spanish official is fifty one years Bringing some officials over fifty years of age to finish their working lives in the villages of Soria or Teruel is not going to represent a great rejuvenation for those territories By the way provinces such as Teruel Zamora or Soria old unpopulated provinces offer us an early picture of what the future of Spain will be if we fail to revive our birth It is true that the demographic situation in those provinces is aggravated by the exodus to other areas for example it has been estimated that one in five young people in Castile and León leave their region in search of opportunities But the main reason that half of Spain is being emptied is not that the young people are leaving but that these young people did not even become born For example the province of Teruel has lost 19 per cent of its population since 1976 but if it had maintained the fertility rate of Spain as a whole in 1976 which was 2.7 children per woman the current population of Teruel despite the juvenile exodus would be 14 per cent higher than in 1976 The current fertility rate of Teruel is 1.3 children per woman in fact it is one tenth higher than the national average which is 1.2 children per woman This means that in Spain as a whole we are 45 below the generational replacement rate which is 2.1 children per woman that is we are having more than half of the children that would be needed to simply ensure the replacement of generations All of this means that in Spain we are on a path of demographic suicide as a nation We are the only political group that dares to speak of the sinking of birth as a serious national problem The other parties especially those of the coalition of government assume the synecdoch of reducing the so called demographic challenge to the rural exodus as if our only demographic problem and we do not deny that it is a problem is that the people of Soria or Teruel go to Madrid or Barcelona and not that not enough children are born For example the National Strategy against the Demographic Challenge approved by this Government in its dozens of pages does not use words once as a father mother children or family it is that the sinking of birth together with the progressive disappearance of marriage in Spain less and less people are married is one of the causes of the collapse of birth The weakening of family ties are taboo issues for progressive consensus parties The left has made its own two anti-natalist ideologies
One of them is feminism which conceives of motherhood as a woman 's biological servitude and if you do n't believe me you read Simone de Beauvoir The other is radical ecology which sees the human species as the cancer of the planet and would like a reduction of the world population to minimize the carbon footprint and human impact on the biosphere The case is that cases such as that in Hungary show that it is possible to revive a country 's birth if appropriate measures are taken These measures include the promotion of support for the rural environment serious family taxation tax breaks according to the number of children measures of reconciliation between motherhood and work the encouragement of marriage and the end of feminist indoctrination in schools as well as corrupt sex education in schools
It always corresponds to the one who comes from outside the effort to adapt to the morals and customs here and only deserve our Spanish nationality which is a high honor those who are willing to embrace the productive effort the culture the history and the Spanish language Thank you very much
"Lords of Citizens they have repeatedly told us that they do not want to be like us Certainly we do not want to be like you either and it seems that there are also many voters who want to be like you judging by the results of the last consultations You tell us that they are unconditionally pro-immigration and that they consider mass emigration to be one of the characteristics of contemporary society I believe that this shows that they put their moral narcissism forward that is their progressive self esteem how multicultural and tolerant I am to the sense of reality and politicians are obliged to attend above all to reality And the reality is that you cannot compare the time when yes certain liberal authors you always claim to be liberal even usurp and monopolize it or try to monopolize it considered immigration law as a fundamental right in the 19th century because the circumstances of the 19th century are not comparable to the current ones In the 19th century it was an intra-Western immigration of Poles who were going to the United States or of Italians who were going to France western populations and therefore there was no cultural shock the clash of civilizations that today occurs with immigrants from civilizations very different from Western ones in values such as for example respect for women The West is an island of respect for women in an ocean of misogynistic civilizations This should be taken into account And who says it and who is measuring the impact of this massive influx of men from Misogynistic countries into Europe is precisely Ayaan Hirsi Ali the author I referred to earlier who is of Somali origin and to whom I do not think they are going to call white supremacist You always boast of liberals for it was a great liberal Milton Friedman who celebrated that you cannot at the same time have a welfare state and open borders To a generous welfare state millions of immigrants will flow simply to receive subsidies not as in the 19th century when one went to the United States to work hard no now many people come with a different mentality I do not say that all much less come to receive subsidies The ease of communication is also not comparable Today it is very easy to move from one country to another even for people who do not have great economic means therefore the number of potential immigrants is simply inimitable Africa has a population of 12 billion twice the European population and it is estimated that by 2050 the African population will be four times the European population The median income of African countries is seventeen times lower than the median income of European countries Therefore we have a continent seventeen times poorer than another one separated by 14 kilometres of sea The situation is potentially explosive and certainly not manageable You who defend the right to immigration in the abstract are willing to receive the four hundred million Africans who according to a Gallup survey of 2018 would like to move to Europe They 're thinking about doing it and they 're saving up to try It 's getting cheaper and cheaper to jump to Europe In recent years the number of nationalizations of foreigners who acquired Spanish citizenship in particular 53 in the last year has grown steadily and in 2020 120 164 foreigners were naturalized I wanted to compare this figure and I finish with another one that seems dramatic to me in 2020 340 000 children were born in Spain It has been an absolute negative record for centuries for centuries there were not so few children born in Spain In addition only 244,000 of them are Spanish mothers The fertility of the Spanish women at this time is 1.25 children per woman This Government supported by progressive consensus has designed a national demographic challenge strategy in which the words family father mother or children do not appear once Then the lines are clear It seems that the elites both from Brussels and the progressive elites here have decided that the solution to our demographic problem is to open the borders to massive immigration from other continents and not to boost national birth Only a few Central European countries which by the way are constantly harassed by Brussels technocrats have made it clear that they have been betting not on immigration but on boosting birth"
of Hungarian and Polish nationals That is the model on which we want to be inspired without that implying that we are refractory to immigration Our demographic salvation will not come from immigration it must come from the fact that Spanish families will have enough children again and that will be what our policies will tend to be Thank you
Thank you Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The way this government is facing the energy crisis has consisted of a series of patches a series of self contradicting bandages The Government constantly contradicts itself How many times did the Minister of Finance tell us that it was impossible to lower VAT from electricity to 5 Finally they had to do it as on the other hand I had asked VOX many times Once again VOX was right and this government is only right when it listens to the opposition As for the famous 20 cent discount on fuels it has already been devoured by the dizzying rise in prices the litre of gasoline was at 1.81 euros on 1 April and is now at 2.14 euros But VOX is not limited to criticizing these bandages these erratic patches of the government because we believe that the shortcomings of this government 's energy policy are not only short term but structural It is the very conceptual framework of this energy policy that suffers from serious shortcomings It is a wrong framework based on climate obsession and the renunciation of energy sovereignty Therefore in this motion we do what we do is to present the master lines of which would be the energy alternative of VOX an alternative based on exactly opposite principles For example we bet on energy sovereignty Our energy dependence at the moment is 74 we import natural gas annually in the amount of 379 terawatts hour 57 million tonnes of oil and 4 million tonnes of coal for a total price of around EUR 19 billion per year By the way governments of both the People 's Party and the Socialist Party dismantled at the time our coal industry Other European countries at the moment are resorting again and again to open coal plants to deal with the emergency it is the case of Germany or also to compensate for the inadequacies of renewable energy in which by the way Germany is a leader The problem is that the climate change law passed a year ago and only VOX voted against it definitely sinks us into energy dependence especially under its articles 9 and 10 which no longer prohibit exploitation if any the investigation of possible hydrocarbon deposits in the Spanish subsoil it also prohibits uranium mining In history it had never been seen that a country gave up its own resources and they were resources that could be very important A study by the Conseil Superior de Colegios de Ingenieros de Minas has encrypted the probable reserves of natural gas in the Spanish subsoil at 1.3 billion with be cubic meters And a 2013 Gesal report referred to potential oil reserves of 2 billion barrels a reservation that yes would only be accessible through hydraulic fracture technology that technology that has allowed the United States to achieve energy self sufficiency The consultant Deloitte estimated that putting these possible hydrocarbon reserves into operation would create 260 000 jobs and increase Spanish GDP by 4.3 Therefore if VOX comes to the government that will do so it will be to repeal that delusional climate change law that prevents us from taking advantage of our own resources We will also take Spain out of the Paris Agreements the European Green Pact and any international agreements that force our economy to join that hysterical accelerated and ruinous decarbonisation process a process that is going to have it is already having an astronomical cost that Spanish companies and families simply cannot afford And I am not exaggerating it is the PNIEC itself our PNIEC which recognises the need for 240 billion decarbonising investments by 2030 when the European Green Pact talks about the need for 260 billion decarbonising investments per year to achieve the proposed targets of reducing European CO2 emissions by 55 compared to 1990 levels Speaking of CO2 there is something that very few people know and it is that the European Union is currently responsible for only 9 of global CO2 emissions and Spain is responsible for a negligible 0.7 Europe is going to get poorer and crush its economy Therefore if it were to achieve that 55 reduction we would be reducing global emissions by only 4 or 5 The planet would n't even give up In other words all this voluntary impoverishment of Europe will have an impact on global warming of only a few hundredths of a degree the warming of the planet in 2100 instead of being 1.81 oC will be 1.79 oC That 's what we 're gonna get with our sacrifice By the way this eventual warming of 1.8 or 2.3 oC in 2100 does not in any case pose an existential threat to humanity as the followers of the climate apocalyptic sect proclaim Warming is more of a problem than humanity has in the 21st century but to which our descendants will no doubt adapt without greater problems On the other hand it is also little known that Europe has already done its homework European emissions have been falling for twenty five years Spanish emissions reached their historical peak in 2005 and since then have been cut by 35 no less European emissions by 22 In the same time frame China 's emissions have doubled since 2005 and tripled since the 1990s Therefore while Europe takes a shot at its foot and lashes its economy with this useless sacrifice China sees the path to world economic supremacy expedited I 'm on my way Other principles of our energy alternative are that Spain insists within the European Union the abolition of the CO2 emission allowance market and above all that the useful life of the seven nuclear reactors that we have left be extended and that construction be studied
of new nuclear reactors taking advantage of European reconstruction funds The Socialist Party already inflicted tremendous damage on the Spanish economy in the 1980s by paralysing the construction of five nuclear reactors that were almost finished
Thank you very much The Spanish need to know why VOX considers it essential that there be a third power in Spain the Judicial Power free and independent of any interference of political parties We have talked many times about reasons that address constitutional issues political issues even issues of the efficiency of the administration of justice itself but it may be much easier to understand if we put on the table in this debate in our amendment to the whole three examples of why when justice is left alone it does justice no more or less When political parties let 's put two examples the Socialist Party and the PNV decide to agree to destroy a part of our historical architectural cultural environmental heritage when they agree to trample the law and common sense it is necessary to have an independent justice I am referring to the barracks of Loiola an alphonsian style military building in San Sebastián Gipuzkoa home of the glorious infantry regiment Tercio Viejo of Sicily n.o 67 In the enterprising pact between the Socialist Party and the PNV it was decided to proceed with the following plan one it will be excluded from the special urban protection within the special protection plan of the City of San Sebastián in Gipuzkoa two once excluded from protection are disaffected from the interest for national defense and therefore of the Armed Forces more specifically of the Army three once disaffected would proceed to the complete demolition of the barracks of Loiola they have heard well converting their facades their shields their courtyards their roofs their historical beams into a pile of rubble that went to the landfill and four putting on top a real estate operation of the City of San Sebastián Once again yes once again and although it weighs us we would have liked to be accompanied by other political parties for example the People 's Party But no it could n't have been this time either as it was not when we filed in solitary the complaints that sat on the bench to the coupts of Catalonia in 2017 or when we brought to the Constitutional Court among other resources also in solitary gentlemen of the People 's Party the fraudulent or unconstitutional states of alarm or when the freedom and control that this Parliament should exercise is sought Only VOX reacted in court Well on this occasion to which I refer VOX initiated a legal action with its corresponding cost with its expert reports of urbanism historical and legal in order to achieve as it has been a historical judgment that has been issued by the Superior Court of Justice of the Basque Country declaring the barracks of Loiola Good of Cultural Interest of special protection one of the maximum urbanistic protections To turn it into rubble to equivalence with the Palace of the Diputation or with the Kursaal Center itself VOX with this action has not only managed to prevent the demolition of a historic building of a singular building which although very important is less so VOX has managed to avoid with this legal action that becomes rubble what is nothing but a symbol of history a symbol of Spain a memory and a symbol of our Armed Forces And since VOX does not stop as VOX does not ask permission or forgiveness when it has to act I am already advancing them and I will not extend myself in this two more examples in which the action of VOX and the action of a justice without being conditioned by political parties will first succeed in sitting on the bench in Andalusia mayors of the Socialist Party the People 's Party and Podemos for the tremendous corruption issue that means Giahsa and second bringing the National High Court and the Supreme Court to the fugitive coupt Puigdemont as the European Court is already recognizing us Ladies and gentlemen these are three examples that show the Spaniards and we could be setting examples all day today and tomorrow that when justice is allowed politicians who trample on the law disregard the Constitution and violate fundamental rights and public freedoms are put in their place In this amendment to the whole of VOX that it has submitted with alternative text compared to the proposed law of the Socialist Parliamentary Group for the amendment of article 570 bis of the Organic Law of the Judiciary VOX recalls once again in this rostrum that article 117 of the Constitution gives the mandate to judges and magistrates who must act only subject to the rule of law and nothing more than the rule of law Article 122.3 therefore established in the Constitution that of the twenty members of the General Council of the Judiciary eight unfortunately would be elected by politicians by political parties four by Congress and four by the Senate Twenty members however decided the constituents and therefore the Spanish people that the majority twelve of its members would not have political origin would not have parliamentary origin and would therefore be elected by and from among the judges Although some would like to twist the Constitution only eight would have to come from the election of political parties Congress and the Senate the other twelve would have to come out of judges and magistrates Only the Judicial Power Act 1980 respected this constitutional mandate respected this constitutional spirit that the majority of the General Council of the Judiciary should be an independent body from the interferences interests and corruptions of political parties But the 1985 law came and it was the Socialist Party yes in the first place that repealed it to carry out the election of those twelve members also by the decision of political parties of Congress and the Senate And I say first of all because it was the Socialist Party but the People 's Party is no less responsible He had absolute majorities and only made makeup that did not change the essence of the problem The essence of the problem ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party is that you continue to decide together with the Socialist Party and its partners who sit on the General Council of the Judiciary which is as much as saying who sit on the Supreme Court on the high courts on the Constitutional Court on the Court of Auditors and on many other bodies that have already been mentioned here today In short since the 1985 law this perversion which has been the appropriation by the Legislature and the Executive of the third power of the State is unfortunately maintained And here is our proposal our amendment to the whole and also of course our proposal to the Spaniards in which we would like we say it loud and clear to have the support of other parties especially the People 's Party The VOX proposal is clear and is based on four principles first that according to the Constitution those twelve members of the General Council of the Judiciary who are to be elected by judges and magistrates are elected by them by all the categories of judges and magistrates who are active that it is through personal vote equal vote direct vote and secret vote that it is in a single constituency for the whole of Spain without any condition or endorsement as it has now been intended neither of a personal nature nor of associations of any political nature however much they all say that they are professional and lastly that the elected cannot in any way be those who are national or autonomous deputies or senators or councillors in active or have been in the previous legislation because of the direct link they have with political parties that in the last four years they have not been part of the electoral lists in political parties and that in the last four years they have not held or held high office in the Administration for the appointment of political power With this I would not win VOX with this I would not win any political party they would win freedom justice and independence The question we ask ourselves is why the rest of the political parties except for some exceptions with makeup did not want to raise this flag for the division of powers and for the independence of the judiciary At the beginning of my speech I gave three examples Unfortunately there are many more and new examples will come in which we will only be safe for the Spaniards if we can count on the guarantees of a judicial power that in no way in its choice or operation depends on the interference of any political party of any party and of course never of the Government of the nation Thank you very much
Mr Garzón do you still think that the Spanish meat we export is of poor quality Thank you very much
The truth is that it is a shame that you did not appear at the last control session to the Government just before the elections at the request of our group Someone told him to hide at home And it 's a shame because every time you talk about any matter the support in the street and in the ballot box is multiplied by thousands to our political group the only social and patriotic alternative to communism You were able to check it last Sunday where your communist group went from having two prosecutors to staying with one Lost 50 And one by the hair worth the redundancy Instead our political group went from one to three brave and gallant prosecutors Minister look it is a real crime that a minister of the Kingdom of Spain dares to attack a social and economic sector as strategic as livestock and food but to do so abroad is already an aggravating factor that makes it a crime of high treason or a crime against the homeland Look at you Minister it 's absolutely false what you said And as we were told by hundreds of farmers from all over Castile and León I will answer on your behalf when you say that Spanish meat is of poor quality here the only thing there is of poor quality is a minister like you and this ignorant government with the real problems of the rural world When you say that the Spanish industry pollutes here the only thing that pollutes are the false and sectarian messages that through their subsidized media transmission straps those that were once called journalists and that today are propagandists of the lie they play the game And when you Minister say that animals are abused in Spain here the only thing that is abused in Spain is the Spaniards with their harmful fiscal policy with their sectarianism and their political totalitarianism and what is equally serious with their corrupt policies Minister do not lie the economy of Spain is at stake and if you do not have the status of minister resign It 's that simple Thank you
"Thank you very much Mr President Madam Justice Minister in order to understand what is happening in justice in Spain and to understand whether these budgets are part of the solution or increase the problem it would be important for us to have four clear figures for all Spaniards and I will refer to them on the basis of the last report published by the General Council of the Judiciary which deals with the year 2021 3 144,000 outstanding cases 2,494,000 outstanding executions therefore resolutions that have already been firm that can be put into practice this adds up to approximately 5,600,000 outstanding cases to be resolved by all the jurisdictions and judicial bodies in Spain Our judicial bodies our judges our judges our lawyers in the administration of justice our judicial agents our prosecutors have made an impressive effort and we must thank them because they have resolved more than 6,300,000 cases This represents an increase in resolutions by no less than 21 over the previous year from 2020 to 2021 But it happens Minister that the litigation in Spain has increased and 6 273 000 new cases have entered That is to say that this fabulous work effort of our judicial bodies of more than 21 over the previous year has failed and will not succeed in avoiding that gigantic delay ball that the Justice Administration has We have the chill of an average of 1,000 cases a year per judge which means that every judge has to solve an average of three cases a day and we talk about 365 days and that 's assuming they did n't have a single weekend of rest or a vacation Let us imagine for a moment a magistrate having to settle three divorce cases three creditor competitions or three criminal cases involving serious crimes on the same day That is the unacceptable workload to which we are subjecting our judicial bodies And we should ask ourselves can we continue to demand even more work from our judicial bodies Do we have the right to demand that they solve the problem So where 's the problem Well look one way to find out is to look around and look at what other countries in our environment are doing Here is the last report of the Council of Europe of October 2022 last month which tells us judges and magistrates in Spain 11 judges and magistrates per 100,000 inhabitants when the average of the European Union is 17 almost 80 more prosecutors in Spain 5 prosecutors per 100,000 inhabitants average of the European Union 11 prosecutors per 100,000 inhabitants Let 's talk about money how many euros are spent in Spain for every inhabitant and year 87 euros Here one will be waiting for me now to give a much higher average of the European Union So here is the problem which turns out that in the European Union the average of euros spent per inhabitant per year is much lower 64 euros That is to say we have budgets of more than EUR 2197 million and those budgets which in addition to being ruinous are the budgets of inefficiency do not solve the problem and above all our judicial bodies have to see judgments such as that of the Constitutional Court on 10 October 2022 pointing out undue delays to a judicial body in Seville because it does not resolve sufficiently in time The key where is it Minister You know it well the General Council of the Judiciary this General Council of the Judiciary that you all always want to control among other things to gag and shut up in your report requested at least the creation of 176 new judicial units and you announced to us last year and this one to drum and platter that you are going to create 70 that you do not even cover the loss that there is for retirements and for casualties and therefore there is still more and more deficit of judicial organs You say not with your head but I remind you that you asked for 176 and you have granted them 70 of 176 70 then there are 106 missing Conclusions These budgets are nothing more than the justice that the People 's Party did when it ruled in this it does work perfectly Conclusions First conclusion all of you and the Spanish have already seen it in the data I have given it turns out that we spend more than the average of the European Union and we have fewer judicial bodies to resolve Secondly if we have fewer judicial bodies to resolve we have less capacity to reduce that terrible delay in the resolution and therefore increase the effective judicial guardianship deficit of the Spaniards Thirdly what happens is that it is very poorly spent because the budgets of justice go through the sinking of twelve autonomous communities with twelve competences of justice plus the five autonomous communities that depend on the Ministry of Justice plus the courses of indoctrination in gender ideology plus the judicial bureaucracy that you have created That is the reality of your budgets Minister which are going that way I 'm finishing up Mr. President Question Who are the great losers in these justice budgets The usual the justiciable the Spanish on foot the one who pays the taxes the one who has to endure a slow late justice a hasty justice"
Thank you very much Madam President Today several days of vodevil theatre and comedy are ending in which some want us to believe that we were faced with a debate on the general budgets of the State We all know it 's a lie everything was agreed and agreed in those dark offices of infamy and constant betrayal of Spain But now it 's time for the truth We 've seen it now it 's time to go through the box right gentlemen of the government It 's up to you to go through the box as you 've been before the florists handing over the Civil Guard to Navarra Now it is time to pass by the box before the coupsmen of Catalonia and the Basque Country But the traitors never pay for their infamy with their heritage with their interests or with their wealth they always do so with others giving them pieces of national sovereignty pieces of the wealth of the Spaniards pieces of the national territory And this is not as some repeat a blackmail of secessionism because there is a clear will to compromise there is connivance and complicity of the Government to receive in return the benefit of budgets It is a proposal for a law that is a clear fraud of law of book of article 6.4 of the Civil Code because we are presented as a proposal for a law of parliamentary groups which should undoubtedly be an organic bill of a government subject to the controls and reports of the General Council of the Judiciary the Council of State the Fiscal Council the State Advocate It is also clearly a diversion of power because by relying on the powers of parliamentary initiative of parliamentary groups the aim sought is clearly illegal a covert amnesty of the coupsmen and the evident usurpation of the powers of the judiciary in the Constitution And it also seeks to delegitimize delegitimize all those who face the coups those forces and security forces of the State who investigated and faced the violent that popular accusation of VOX who alone sat them on the bench that brave State Attorney General Mr. Maza who rested in peace those Supreme Court Prosecutors who did not kneel before the manipulation and pressure of the new State Attorney General and that Supreme Court Criminal Chamber which although shorter and more cowardly than we had wanted handed down a conviction On the contrary this action of the Government this initiative of its parties what it does is clearly legitimize the coups the violent and their accomplices And the objectives are very clear in application of the principle of retroactivity of the most favourable criminal law reduce the sentences of disqualification of the thugs of those who were convicted of serious crimes of sedition embezzlement and disobedience and also how not facilitate the return return of the escaped cowards from Puigdemont and his accomplices But VOX fulfills VOX said that he would sit you on the bench and sat you on the bench VOX now says that he will again approve in the Penal Code the crimes of sedition rebellion and embezzlement that all of you from the bench of treason to Spain are going to repeal and we will do so by strengthening the mechanisms of the State so that the coupsmen will have it more and more difficult That is why this very week we have recorded a proposal to strengthen precisely that authority that official that member of any government that incites insists collaborates or facilitates a coup d'état be condemned and moreover that loses the Spanish nationality if not of origin anyone that facilitates the rupture of the Spanish nation or that favors the outrages to Spain and its offenses This debate is a great opportunity to repeat
loud and clear to those who do not know it out of ignorance to those who have forgotten it out of cowardice and to those who hate it out of betrayal to Spain that Spain is not the goods owned by their lords that Spain is not for sale that national sovereignty does not belong to either the deputies the parties or the parliamentary groups of this House And it was the Constitution itself that made it very clear that national sovereignty yes national not as some of the most common left pretend to call it popular sovereignty resides in all the Spanish people and not in one part not in the Catalan people in the Basque people or in the Galician people And in that national sovereignty of the Spanish people reside all the powers such as the Legislature the Executive and the Judiciary And it was that same Constitution approved by the vast majority of Spaniards that made it clear that there is no Constitution without a nation and in its second article it made clear clearly that this Constitution that protects us is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards And because it is indissoluble Spain cannot be dissolved either in globalist world governments or in European federalisms And because it is indivisible the unity of Spain and its sovereignty cannot be divided term president into religions or provinces
That national sovereignty cannot be divided into religions provinces cities or peoples because whether many of their lordships like it or not the Spaniards are legitimate heirs of a historical legacy which in a way of national usufruct forces us to defend preserve and improve this nation that we have inherited from the generations that preceded us that fought that worked and that died
And we have an obligation ladies and gentlemen to give it to future generations That 's why VOX does n't stand idly by that 's why VOX summons the Spanish people this Sunday so that in front of the municipalities of all of Spain he mobilizes raises his voice and tells the whole of Spain that we want to be able to vote to cast
to the treacherous and complicit Government to this Government of ruin And we will because we believe in Spain and that 's why you have the complete assurance that Spain
that defends freedom and the nation will win Thank you
Thank you very much President I am speaking on behalf of the VOX Parliamentary Group which out of decency does not continue to sit in the seats before a plenary that is absolutely fraudulent and especially when we are faced with an unacceptable and disgusting climate of violence and threat by different deputies of the extreme left of the Sánchez Government against the judges of the Constitutional Court which is the same as against the judiciary as a whole saying and affirming that they would not tolerate any toga putting limits on the self government of the people or that the judges were coups with toga In short statements clearly contrary to the Constitution disregarding democracy the separation of powers and the freedom of the Spanish to be legitimately represented in this House and protected by judicial bodies This is nothing other than an assault or institutional coup perfectly planned by Sánchez his Government and the parties that support him which began on 14 November by admitting the Bureau of Government to the processing of this bill to which our group opposed clear regulatory fraud which continued shortly afterwards on 24 November with an extraordinary plenary called urgently for its consideration which was also received with our opposition a few days later on 1 December a new urgent extraordinary plenary to discuss the amendments to the whole as our group did A few days later the speaker was summoned to the Presentation of this law and had to listen with concern and great surprise to how the lawyers of these Courts warned and warned that with the admission of different amendments there was a clear lack of homogeneity absolute disconnection and material inconsistency with the amended text and especially with amendments 61 and 62 which attempt to reform the Organic Law of the Judiciary and the Constitutional Court We request on the same day 12 different written documents from the Bureau which have not yet been resolved calling for the non-admission of the processing of these amendments reports to the Constitutional Court the General Council of the Judiciary the State Advocate the Council of State and the lawyers themselves of this House A day later again in a hurry on 13 December we were called to a Commission of Justice where we again opposed and reiterated the necessary non-admission of this procedure And today today 15 December a new call for an urgent special plenary session for the final vote on the opinion Today we appealed to the Constitutional Court for amparo requesting the interim measure of suspension of the proceedings for obvious violations of fundamental rights constitutional rights And we have to listen after the speech of our spokesman to the only Spanish woman the president of this House who has not heard and who does not know the notoriety of these amparo resources This is in short the situation before us A procedure against which we oppose in substance and in form in law and in procedure a procedure that is a clear procedural fraud a fraud to the law and a very clear unconstitutionality The objectives are not hidden from any of your ladies and gentlemen but not from the Spanish First what the Government and its partners are looking for is a covert amnesty for all coupsmen abrogating the crime of sedition and encouraging them to re-incurrence in it reducing the penalties for corrupt people by reducing penalties for embezzlement of public funds The final political control of the General Council of the Judiciary reducing the necessary majority from three fifths to a simple majority breaking the necessary decision as a collegiate body and reducing the voting of only one of the candidates for the Constitutional Court 's judge for its members In short an assault on the Constitutional Court even abolishing without the slightest shame the procedure of suitability necessary to acquire the status of magistrate and violating the Constitution within the necessary time limits for its renewal rather than by thirds per sixth All this ladies and gentlemen has serious consequences and those who are going to vote in favour of this law are perfectly aware and aware of what they are doing that impunity to those who openly boast that they will again give a coup d'état to those who clearly support the corrupt within their parties and in their governments who clearly claim to be able to adopt clearly unconstitutional rules from now on as indeed were the states of alarm having an absolutely domesticated Constitutional Court and at the service of the Government to succeed in rejecting in this way all the remedies of unconstitutionality that are pending among others the more than forty remedies of unconstitutionality lodged by the VOX Parliamentary Group From today on it will cease to be called the Constitutional Court and turn its name into the governmental court of the Government of Pedro Sánchez By the way Sánchez had already credited his betrayal of Spain today moreover he believes his cowardice not being here when the Constitution and the rule of law are being trampled I 'm finishing up Madam President Today unfortunately it is what we could describe as the death or de facto disappearance of the division of powers of the rule of law democracy and the Constitution Some believe that coups of state are made with weapons and military uniform but those are more visible the most dangerous are the coups of state that are made from within the institutions themselves taking advantage of precisely
taking advantage precisely of the springs that the institutions allow them as we could already see in Catalonia from the Generality of Catalonia and with the support of the Catalan institutions Today in short is a sad day for Spain a very sad day for democracy a very sad day for this House but it is also a day of hope because the more you intend to twist the state the more you intend to trample the Constitution the more you despise and hate Spain the greater the response of the vast majority of Spaniards which will be to throw you off the street very soon or to sit a large part of you on the bench Thank you very much
Thank you very much Mr President This proposal for an organic law brought to us by the Socialist Group is a clear threat to the independence of justice the rule of law and legality That is why I would like my first words to pay tribute to a man Pedro Alfonso Casado lieutenant colonel of the Civil Guard of the Special Intervention Unit who died on 5 July in an act of service precisely defending legality the rule of law and justice Honor and glory to the Civil Guard and its heroes Now let 's go to what I do n't know if I qualify as a sanatorium a voodoo or a pantomime between the Socialist Party and the People 's Party so much riding riding so much they 're always the same doing the same If we go back to March last year we realize that the Socialist Group with its partner Podemos presented a proposal for an organic law to approve article 570 bis of the Organic Law of the Judiciary In his explanatory statement he told us I read literally From the above the need to limit the decisions taken by a outgoing General Council of the Judiciary i.e. in office to exclude from its powers the possibility of electing inter alia the judges of the Constitutional Court This is a year and a few months ago Well now in July 2022 the Socialist Group we have fallen from the proposal presents us with the reform of the reform Now that article 570 bis is no longer valid for them it no longer serves them and they seek for the single direct reading procedure and therefore trying as far as possible to ignore this very serious attack on justice and the independence of the judiciary that we adopt a proposal in which it now says otherwise To avoid this situation which they created in the March reform last year which can cause difficulties in the renewal of constitutional bodies it is proposed to reform this article so that the General Council of the Judiciary can now appoint at least the two judges of the Constitutional Court which is what they claim corresponding by election of the General Council of the Judiciary This has been reported by the courts I will refer to the complaint made to the Group of States against the Corruption of the Council of Europe GRECO by the Civic Platform for Judicial Independence They have clearly stated that it is solely in the interest of the Government to control the Constitutional Court They have said in their complaint that it is a formal violation because it avoids any process of hearing when presenting it as a proposal for an organic law and not as a draft law Moreover it falls into the background of an issue that clearly violates article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights because it violates or violates the principles of guarantee independence and impartiality of judicial bodies We could continue to make all kinds of legal assessments but I believe that the Spaniards need to speak to them in clear high and precise Spanish in this seat of national sovereignty to put aside the entire media circus and the politicians language to which the Socialist Party and the People 's Party so accustomed and to tell them and explain at least for that reason VOX has come what is behind many of these parliamentary initiatives I would like to underline the special gravity of this and I will do so in a graphic way with this drawing in which all Spaniards will be able to see the Congress of Deputies and all its lords above reforming the Organic Law of the Judiciary Well what do you want with it To appoint toe yes toe magistrates who are like them And place them where At the General Council of the Judiciary and hence directly at the Constitutional Court For what To continue to control the Constitutional Court politically And what do you want with that They claim that there will be no further rulings declaring the unconstitutionality of two states of alarm or for example the unconstitutionality of including Pablo Iglesias in the CNI 's supervisory commission or that the remedy for the kidnapping of this same House will be allowed or that resources such as those that our group has submitted against labour reform or against euthanasia so many resources that the Socialist Party fears may go wrong in a constitutional court that has not properly tied up That is the reality that is the sad reality before which we find ourselves a Socialist Party and a People 's Party that do not claim in any way even if they are filled with mouths saying otherwise that there is an independent justice We will speak tomorrow about VOX 's proposal that the General Council of the Judiciary be truly an independent body that the twelve judges under the Judiciary be elected by and from judges and magistrates that politicians through Congress and the Senate not be able to continue to put to their finger in the Supreme Court in the provincial hearings in the National High Court and in the Constitutional Court that they denounce before all of you and the Spanish the constant maneuvers they have made because they do not believe in the division of powers because they do not believe in the rule of law and because they believe much less in judges and magistrates who act exclusively to the dictate of the law and to the service of legality the rule of law and the Constitution The Socialist Party and the People 's Party or the People 's Party and the Socialist Party want puppets that they can handle but that sooner than later with VOX in government is going to end Thank you very much
Thank you very much Mr President Obviously we reject the proposal and reject the form of its processing a direct and urgent procedure which in essence violates the possibility of a hearing procedure that should have passed if it had been presented not as a proposal but as a draft law Hearing among others in the associations of judges and prosecutors in the so called European Commission for Democracy by Law or Commission of Venice and in the General Council of the Judiciary itself Therefore this urgency could be described as a very clear premeditation and lightening they lack the night although they will soon also achieve it Basically all you want is for this shame to pass quickly to democracy this shame to the state and this shame to judicial independence But the Spaniards will soon know that there are other ways of doing things respecting the powers of the State respecting the division of powers and respecting the judges and magistrates in the legitimate exercise of their power Thank you very much
Thank you very much Mr President Do n't worry today I did n't bring the iron bar and the chain with which the emigrants beat the police no need All I had to do was teach them the fork so that all of you would cry out Wow a weapon that has brought the VOX one Preliminary question Mr President Putin 's tyrant is applauded and supported by the Puebla Group to which several ministers of this Government and a Secretary of State belong Nothing more to add This motion as a result of the urgent inquiry we presented last week is a further consequence not the cause of the serious situation in Spain and Europe It is not necessary for us to retell the ten lies that we had to point out from this rostrum last week at least I will announce them so that they have no doubt One Ceuta and Melilla are not Morocco they have never been and never will be Two refugees are not peaceful refugees they are violent assailant young people from our borders Three Morocco does not help border control Morocco collaborates with these jumps Morocco blackmails in exchange for money to the Government of Spain Morocco causes an invasion by substitution in the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and in the Canary Islands Four the fence is not safe As has already been said here today the minister has been putting the appropriate means both in the fence itself with the so called inverted combs or as proposed by this group raising the fence to the necessary two meters and now hurry and run tells us that in three months he will solve it Five the agents of the state security forces and bodies the National Police the Civil Guard the local police of Ceuta and Melilla do not have the appropriate means and when they have them like the anti-disturbing means they are not allowed to use them Six pseudo NGOs are not humanitarian NGOs they are part of the plot of the human trafficking mafias who use human tragedy as a business Seven the Armed Forces can play a very important and very necessary role in the control of our borders they are trained and have the means for mass control you just have to give them the order Eight NATO the North Atlantic Treaty does not protect the borders of Europe the borders of Spain in Ceuta and Melilla because they are squares that are not covered as requested by this group by Article 6 and as my colleague Rocío de Meer reminded the People 's Party the solution is not to open the borders with the inclusion of Ceuta and Melilla in the Schengen agreement but in Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty Nine it is not true that the media inform about what is happening in our cities of Ceuta and Melilla but manipulate that information always demonizing the agents criminalizing them and making it seem like those who assault do it with roses and flowers rather than with forks and iron bars And finally illegal immigration is not good illegal immigration causes labor saturation of public services the other is good legal immigration The amendments of the People 's Party and the Citizens Party to our motion are clearly rejected The People 's Party turns its absurd position into a contradiction to the same motion we heard a few minutes ago It tells us in its amendment that we have to withdraw the paragraph in which we say that there must be collaboration involvement of the Armed Forces in border control and they have just said in the previous motion that what is needed is coordination with the Armed Forces Agree among the different sectors of your party Of course the participation of the Armed Forces is necessary Of course we will not accept that amendment And to Citizens what am I going to say Smoke The only thing that is correct is what he repeats in his motion and the rest incongruity Here what we are talking about and that is the important thing is respect for national sovereignty and security that which is lacking in Europe that sovereignty and that respect for the security of the borders that we are demanding for the Ukrainian people for the terrible genocidal invasion of the tyrant communist dictator of Putin For that freedom for the Ukrainian people that sovereignty and that respect for the borders that the ministers and government partners do not want to respect by supporting Putin from this group we say that we want a Europe with secure borders that we want a Europe where the sovereignty of nations is respected And to all the globalist progress of the extreme left of the left and of the cowardly right that buys the globalist discourse we tell you that Europe will only survive if it has strong nations that defend themselves from permanent threats And security is also talking today about security in the streets internal security in our nations That 's why we say No to the youth gangs that are causing violence on our streets not to the menas that are causing violence on our streets and not to the illegal illegal and violent immigrants who have assaulted our borders and who are causing insecurity on our streets And to talk about security of course is also to talk about energy security which is why this Saturday thousands of Spaniards millions of Spaniards are going to concentrate before all the municipalities We want energy security energy sovereignty so we do n't depend on any outside satraps that can cut our electricity gas or oil And we want food security so that our farmers and farmers can feed Spain and we do n't have the risk that foreign products will ruin them or that foreign political decisions will close our borders And finally we want legal certainty so that there are no coupsmen who give coups d'état and governments who indulgate that security and sovereignty ladies and gentlemen is what it is security at our borders
Thank you very much President Minister in this urgent inquiry by our VOX Parliamentary Group what we are asking you which is on behalf of the Government is what you intend to do to prevent those who want to destroy national unity by trampling on the Constitution and disregarding the national sovereignty of the Spaniards from achieving their goal It is terrible that we have to ask this question this urgent interpellation to a Government of a nation because it should be understood that its main reason is to prevent the enemies of the nation from achieving their objectives But you Minister have been fulfilling the road map marked by the separatists by the coups by the enemies of the nation and you have done so from the first minute step by step sitting to sitting This government was born of the great lie of the great electoral fraud that was that betrayal and transfer that they made to the enemies of the nation betraying their own voters their own voters when they promised the candidate for president in the elections Pedro Sánchez who has put you there who will never deal with those who have blood stained hands that he will never deal with those who had given a coup d'état with those who wanted to destroy Spain and that he will never and would never be able to sleep peacefully if he deals with those of the ration cards the communist totalitarians But he gave in He gave in to sit there on the blue bench and you can sit there The first major assignment Minister I could see it sitting on the benches of the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court when the State Attorney 's Office was instructed that what was a clear and clear accusation of crime against the Constitution of rebellion against the coups of magic not of assignment to the coups became at the stage of prosecution a charge of the State Attorney 's Office of crime against public order of sedition We are now beginning to understand this latest reform of the Criminal Code because they do not want the crime of sedition either And then Minister then what came Do you remember Then came judgments from the Second Chamber and since they could not avoid that condemnation came the wretched unworthy and unwarranted pardons contrary to the law for each and every one of the condemned Do you remember who the Minister of Justice was I 'll tell you Mr. Campos Does that ring a bell He is one of the candidates who now want to put in the Constitutional Court Minister are we still talking about divestitures Then came the assignments to the protera The ETA had to be whitewashed and the Democratic Memory Act created Well memory and democracy have nothing but assignment has a lot Assignment to the ETA to write the story yes the story because then the Transition is delegitimized the Crown is delegitimized and tributes to terrorists are favored of course scorning and trampling on the victims of terrorism Then came the assignment to the PNV minister remember Bildu and PNV Prison powers had to be transferred so that such health reports could be issued by the Basque Government itself For what But what do you think that we do n't realize Then came the next session Minister the approach of prisoners to Basque prisons as a step before health reports that allow them to go out to the street through a fraudulent third degree Minister then came the divestitures removing any presence from the state His majesty the king could not hand over the offices to the magistrates of the judicial career in Catalonia The head of State had to be hidden because he represented national sovereignty he represented national unity Therefore you do nothing for the withdrawal of national teachings and flags in so many public buildings in Catalonia the Basque Country Navarre etc Why Because the presence of the State annoys its separatist partners and therefore a new assignment Then came the assignment that old claim from the fucking terrorist gang ETA you know what it is do n't you That the Navarra Civil Guard had to be removed New assignment to proletarian separatism Then came new assignments How is it that the National Director of the CNI dares to investigate our coup partners No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no But where did this come from In what rule of law is information services allowed to investigate those who want to commit very serious crimes and make coups d'état No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no It was immediately ceased and in addition the CNI was instructed in no way to dare to investigate those who give coups d'état or those who prepare them or violent RCDs or groups declared by various courts as terrorist groups linked to separatism Information services are n't for that no According to you of course New assignments Absolute unprotectiveness to Spanish Of course that the judgment of the Supreme Court ratifies the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of Catalonia that protects that vast majority of Spaniards who want to educate their children in the mother tongue the common language minister the common language Spanish at least in that miserable 25 when their partners from the Generality approve that decree that prevents schooling in Spanish you do not resort to it you do absolutely nothing These assignments we see here every day Do you remember Minister The University law you 've got it on the agenda You have to turn off the Spanish Do you remember the Sports Act also dealt with in this House International competitions must be allowed to go to the national selections of the autonomous communities as if they were countries Do you remember the railway law also dealt with in this House It is that we could list all the laws because in all there is the tuff of the assignment to the enemies of Spain I told him that if he remembers Minister the railway law which also has it on the agenda because I know he has them all pointed out In the morning you tell them what to do and then you come here and do it Under the railway law infrastructure of general interest which has been attached to the national rail network of ADIF or Renfe for centuries can be decommissioned and delivered on a tray to the autonomous governments dismembering a basic national transport infrastructure And so we could follow law after law assignment after assignment minister Are we talking about the Court of Auditors Do you remember that assignment They called him on the phone and said Do n't forget we have opened a file a very serious case in the Court of Auditors for misappropriation of public funds the money fund of all Spaniards The coupts diverted money minister from all the Spaniards and there was an open case in the Court of Auditors And what did your government order in a new assignment That the State Advocate did not file in time and form the corresponding claim and it was filed New assignment to collapsing Are we still talking Are we still talking Minister We have seen it here a few days ago general state budgets to the dictate of the PNV of Bildu of Republican Squerra to the dictate By the way remember what Otegui said Well it 's worth supporting some budgets if this allows us to bring our killers closer to the Basque Country And those budgets plagued and plagued with departures of money to favor the coup makers those who hate Spain for example with the embassies abroad which are a new sign of contempt for that exclusive competence of the State that is foreign policy You allow them to discredit the state and to speak as if Catalonia or the Basque Country were nations Galicia also do not want to forget the Galician embassies Or when you use TV3 for example that machinery of hatred and propaganda at the service of Catalan separatists which you also water in budgets And so Minister cession after cession after cession in these general state budgets The last payment we all know has been political today the crime of sedition had to be repealed that general amnesty covered by the coup From rebellion which they did not like we went to sedition From sedition we go to crimes against public order The next thing Minister come on courage imagination is that instead of a crime we give you a subsidy for a coup d'état Minister laugh but it is the sad reality of what you are doing in Spain you can laugh and smile but to the Spaniards it does not make any grace what you are doing I say it absolutely with regret The embezzlement was also another of the divestitures Since many of its partners are accused or convicted of crimes of embezzlement penalties had to be reduced Moreover by way of an absolutely dantesque procedure with lightness premeditation nocturnality without presenting it as an organic bill to avoid reports and doing so as a bill of the parliamentary groups hurrying and running to see if we do not realize and change the Penal Code so for the bajini The last Mr Minister is the terrible attack on the rule of law on the judiciary through the reforms which have now been suspended I say for the time being by the General Council of the Judiciary and the Constitutional Court in order first of all to ensure that there is no remedy of unconstitutionality such as those of the states of alarm which have prospered thanks to VOX so that you can continue to pass the laws that will please you without a Constitutional Court stopping you and who knows Minister to see if I am imagining too much to favour a separatist referendum and that there is no Constitutional Court declaring you unconstitutional I 'm done Madam President Minister do not ask VOX ask the Spanish people and history will you do something to prevent the coupsmen the separatists those who hate Spain and want to destroy the nation national sovereignty and the Constitution from achieving their objectives Or are you going to keep scrubbing that road map that leads us to suicide It is a pity Minister that we are here to denounce it and soon in the ballot box the Spanish people to put a stop to it Thank you very much
Thank you very much Madam President Minister you have started your speech by saying that you believe in Parliament in parliamentarianism Really Why did they close this Parliament so that we could not control their fraudulent declared alarm states thanks to VOX in cons ti ti cio in the -em Why is your mouth filled by saying that you respect Parliament if you are then willing to hand it over to those who just do n't believe in anything that comes out of this Parliament because they want to set up their separatist sovereign parliaments You then said Minister that this Parliament represents Spain Man let me do a math represent the Legislative Power Spain is much more There is also a judicial power which is not in here and an executive to which this Parliament should control although unfortunately as you together with the People 's Party have devoted yourselves to carrying out any kind of division of powers this Parliament has no real capacity to control the different executives But Spain is much more Spain is his story Spain is millions of Spaniards who because of people like you do not feel represented in this House because you have created an absolute separation between fiction and real politics Spain which is in the fields in the markets in the workshops in the queues of unemployment that Spain the real Spain which is cold because of its negationisms and its policies of absolute climate fanaticism at the expense of foreign powers that Spain which is cold or cannot put air conditioning by its policies does not feel represented in this Parliament You say that we are committed to repeating over and over again that there is a very serious problem a very serious threat and a very serious risk of breaking up national unity But do you think there 's only one Spanish including you who does n't see it He says that this problem as you have defined it of separatism of Catalans of so called Catalan leaders has already been overcome You said It 's been overtaken But who told you that Otegi Ruffian Because they are achieving their goals through Moncloa through conditioning the Government of Spain Minister you say and you boast because we have heard it here many times and we have heard it from Sánchez who thanks to you was able to protect many workers in the pandemic How many It will be for those who did not stay on the road unfortunately because of their negligence for those who did not lose their lives because you were unable to put the sanitary means in time because you dedicated yourselves to denying reality and when we had it on it was late for many of them Are you referring to the thousands who lost their jobs by fraudulent states of alarm in which you forbade them from exercising their work Because you decided that only certain jobs were essential as if bringing bread home was not essential for every worker You have repeated Minister in the speeches preceding this inquiry and in your own reply to the inquiry between sixteen and eighteen times the word ultra-right Then you are those of the talent those of the tone the educated gentleman the minister I 'd be very easy to get up here and answer one by one to those seventeen times It would suffice me to say that speaking of ultras high treason is what you represent the ultra futility to solve the problems of Spain is what you represent the ultra cowardice to confront the enemies of Spain is what you represent In short they represent the ultra left very well But do you know what 's going on That what concerns us are the problems of Spain not what you are Thank you very much
"Thank you very much Madam President This proposed law submitted by the VOX Parliamentary Group and which I have the honour to defend seeks to amend the Organic Law 10/1995 of the Criminal Code adding a paragraph in article 20.4 in order to ensure full exemption from criminal responsibility when action is taken in self defence I think that as in so many things in life we could give long explanations but things are better understood better understood and especially in these cases better empathized if we bring some examples I have already told you that many of you will know them but it is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of those who have had to suffer these situations and moreover to be fair when it comes to assessing what we would have done if we had found ourselves in the same situation Here 's the thing The legislators are often told that we are far from reality that laws are obsolete or that they have never come to understand the reality they seek to regulate This is one of those cases in which dramatically many Spaniards have had to go through situations that were in themselves tragic but that the law has done doubly tragic But above all and let me draw your attention to this issue tomorrow or past any of you even those who are distracted looking at the mobile phone or thinking about other things your parents grandparents or loved ones might find themselves in this very situation Then they will ask how could it have happened to me How could I be abandoned by the rule of law This has little to do with political issues of parties it has to do with issues of common sense and if I am hastened of the simplest and most plain sense of justice and equity and equal could be in Spain than in any other country Let 's talk about Jacinto's case in a municipality in Tenerife an 80 year old man Two assailants violently entered his house and beat him and his wife with heaviness They carry sharp carpenter iron forms and a gun-yes a gun which was later shown to be a simulated weapon although I wonder which one of us stands in front of an assailant who carries a gun in his hand and says Excuse me is it true or false It was a gun that made this person see that his life depended on his reaction He was able to reach a closet pull out a gun for which he had a gun license give a warning shot to the floor that was not attended by the assailants and shoot at one of them by shooting down This man Jacinto was sentenced to two and a half years for murder and had to pay 20,000 euros in fine But look in the trial itself the other assailant said to questions from the prosecution For I would have done the same as Jacinto did and by the way would not have let any assailant escape if it had been my family that was at risk Second example Pepe seventy seven years old in the municipality of Ciudad Real An assailant about thirty years old carrying a chainsaw in his hand entered his home We 're not talking about the Texas Killing movie we 're talking about a reality a man who faced a stranger in his own house with a chainsaw in his hand He managed to reach of course prisoner of panic and fear a closet in which he had a licensed hunting shotgun and managed to shoot down the assailant thus saving his life He was charged with murder and went to prison Let 's talk about another case in the Balearics Pau aged eighty two had to be assaulted in his home by four assailants with an average age of twenty five who wanted to steal from him Likewise this man who lived in the countryside after the beating that had struck him and while they were checking the house to find money or some object to steal from him managed to catch his hunting shotgun and was able to shoot down one of the assailants This man Pau was sentenced to four years in prison for murder and had to compensate the families of the assaulted assailant with more than 100,000 euros And the last example I bring you is that of a person I could personally meet with his wife in Jaen He is called Remigio and is seventy years old she is seventy eight years old Two robbers entered his house and beat them to death for which they were hospitalized for more than ten days His knees were broken with an iron bar I assure you my tears fell when they introduced me to that poor old lady with all her arms all her legs and all her bruised back They wanted to rob them but as Remigio said If we have nothing The reality is that he had a shotgun but it was such a beating that he could n't even get to the room he was in He feared for his life and feared for his wife 's life and told us that he felt pain because he believed that before her he would be killed He could n't take that gun He did not shoot or shoot any of the assailants and was therefore not prosecuted or convicted But we have no doubt that if he had been able to exercise the right to self defence had he reached the closet had he taken the weapon and had shot and shot at any of the assailants he would have been prosecuted and would have been convicted We could continue to set many other examples but there are others that I did not want to bring because unfortunately the victims of these assaults could not tell them because they could not reach the closet because they could not take a gun because they could not take a knife from the kitchen because they could not take a vase or a lamp or a shovel from the garden or any element that would have allowed them to save their life These are the cases of those who suffered assaults on their home and who died murdered at the hands of the assailants They could not exercise the right to self defence We today ask you under article 17 of the Constitution which guarantees the right to liberty and security of all Spaniards and article 18.2 which guarantees the right to inviolability of our home to defend ourselves against those who endanger our lives or that of our relatives our physical integrity or our property through trespassing or the crime of usurpation And we ask them to amend and add to the Criminal Code a paragraph in article 20.4 to ensure that there is a security right and effective and a legal presumption that any means used for the self defence of your home your family or your life must be considered automatically and by design of the law as a rational proportionate and necessary means and that therefore the exemption from any liability takes place I will finish my speech with two sentences One I said in public when I met Remigio and promised four years ago that one day we will bring this initiative to this House to this Congress of Deputies I said to him When VOX can we guarantee the exercise of the right to self defence with the legally guaranteed exemption of anyone who makes a legitimate use of any instrument with which he can defend or at least attempt to defend his life or integrity And I said to him more When VOX is in the Government of Spain not only will they not have to go through the bench they will not only not be accused but we will impose a medal on civil merit for helping us fight crime and helping to restore the rule of law I want to end with a phrase that is not mine it 's from a nefarious communist with which we had the misfortune of having to coincide which I do n't say share in these seats That communist said repeatedly Fear is going to change sides For this initiative seeks that fear changes its side and that older people who are in their homes terrified that one day they may enter someone and put their life or that of their family at risk may have the peace of mind that if the police or the Civil Guard and they have the opportunity to defend themselves they will never be accused or seated on a bench And therefore those who start to be afraid will be the assailants who will twice think of entering a house in case they may find themselves stranded or with a brave hero who with a kitchen knife in his hand will face them and do the justice that perhaps the State at that time has not been able to do Thank you very much"
Of course The deputy of the Galician separatist bloc said 'Gunman Smith and I think it is intolerable
Thank you very much I support on behalf of Spain 's third political force for the moment an amendment to the whole with an alternative text an amendment incorporating point k of article 39 of the Criminal Code for something that should be logical in any legislation which is simply that anyone who attacks the nation if not a national of origin loses his nationality because Spanish nationality is a right and is a privilege and cannot be granted to those who attack that unity Last week several of the parties who openly defend in this House the permanent attack on national unity who advocate permanently for the breaking of the coexistence between the Spaniards the most absolute contempt for the Constitution applauded euphoric when I announced that proposal I 'm telling you you do n't need to be applauded Stop wasting your time You do n't have to spend as much effort on your longing independence as you call it It is very simple give up Spanish nationality take a plane and leave It 's very easy they have it very easy Mr. Rufián it 's very easy Have the courage to renounce Spanish nationality ask for nationality in North Korea Cuba or Venezuela Take a plane get out of here and leave us alone because if there 's something the Spaniards can't bear it 's the hard face and hypocrisy of those who are here paying a salary and are undermining and breaking national sovereignty from within the institutions to get subsidies money for their chiringuitos and continue advertising hate and separatist lies Give up Spanish nationality be brave If you hate Spain so much the Spaniards their history and their institutions you renounce Spanish nationality but yes you must leave without taking a single apex of what belongs to us all not one centimeter of our land and our soil not one of our rights not one of our institutions We also propose in this amendment to include in its entirety subparagraph c to article 432 of the Criminal Code in order to further strengthen the crime of embezzlement which some probably for their Andalusian interests are already trying to reform until they leave it in the water of drunkards Because in the end what do we say It is very simple and it is also very logical in any legislation that anyone who allocates funds or resources for purposes that are contrary to the Constitution itself in order to violate national unity and the rights of all Spaniards must be convicted of an offence of embezzlement and in addition that offence and penalties must be reinforced if they are public office The third issue that we add in this amendment to the whole a new article 484 bis so that in everything that is considered a crime against national unity when those who engage in it are officials authorities or part of any government of the nation or work closely as happened in 2017 with some foreign nations or with foreign organizations the penalty is increased to twenty years of imprisonment and twenty years of disqualification and of course that those who do not have nationality of origin lose Spanish nationality Similarly we propose the addition of points 2 and 3 in article 543 of the Criminal Code so that anyone who commits outrages and offenses against the Spanish nation with an obvious and clear objective of encouraging protecting or exalting terrorists or the purposes of terrorists violating the Constitution or carrying out coup movements against the unity of Spain are sentenced to up to two years imprisonment and disqualification Fifth With regard to the crime of sedition that this Government wishes to repeal Increase the penalties to a maximum of fifteen years because we all know and I repeated it in this very rostrum last week what is the reason why this crime is being repealed It is an absolutely well known reason for the vast majority of Spaniards It has a direct relationship first of all with the approval of the budgets and lastly with this pact against everything that Spain represents against all the constitutional or criminal defence mechanisms that Spain has In the end we said it is to encourage the fugitives to return the convicts to be able to see their disqualification penalty reduced and that in the end that effect called the effect called in this case the coup d'état is a reality because the less defence mechanisms the State has the easier it is for those who want to destroy I would like to appeal from this rostrum as some fellow Members of my group have already done to a fundamental right of all Spaniards but especially of those who have the status of representatives of national sovereignty I would like to appeal to the right to freedom of expression enshrined in article 20.1 of the Constitution the right to be able to express freely any thought idea or opinion in word or in writing It seems incredible that we have to raise our voice in this Parliament but it is better to do so now than to regret one day for turning us into the Cuban Venezuelan assembly We prefer to do so now that we are still in time for the Spaniards to react so that as soon as possible we leave the Moncloa to whom he has openly decided to hand over Spain on a tray to those who openly decide its destruction We have been called upon by the presidency of this House over and over again to respect the Rules of Procedure For we who are the first to respect the laws and the Constitution the first to demand their compliance before the courts in the media and in the streets say that in order to respect this regulation which we do every day we must be prepared to respect the rule on which the Rules of this House are based which is nothing other than the Constitution And if the Constitution is respected no one can be protected against the foundation of the Constitution which is according to article 2 the Spanish nation the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation the common and indivisible homeland of the Spaniards And because the nation is before and because historical institutions laws constitutions customs our territory our different forms of state throughout history are before this Constitution the Constitution has no value if its foundation which is the nation is despised or attacked And if we attack the nation we attack national sovereignty which belongs to all Spaniards Therefore from this rostrum in exercise of that fundamental right to freedom of expression in no respect for the Rules of Procedure of this House in no respect for the Constitution but above all in no respect for the nation on which it is based we say that whoever attacks the unity of Spain who despises the historical coexistence of the Spaniards and who does so from the institutions is a couplist Whoever defends defends or exalts the murderers of the terrorist gangs is either a flootera or a protera or if I 'm in a hurry a very long time ago And there will be those who are upset but they will not change the meaning of things even if some want to erase in their censorship the whole dictionary because freedom consists precisely in being able to say here in the House of National Sovereignty what millions of Spaniards think and say on the street that we want clean institutions of parties that openly by action or by omission are favoring and driving the destruction of the Spanish nation that we want free institutions of those who use public funds misappropriating them for the objectives of exalting terrorism or destroying the nation that we want loyal institutions with the Spanish loyal with the Constitution loyal with the rule of law and compliant with the law that we want in short institutions where the Spanish are defended where Spain is defended and where freedom is defended And until we do we will continue to fight in this House some like it or not in the courts in the streets in the media and where we are being fought because we have neither come to kneel before the separatists nor to be afraid of the florets let alone those who defend and tolerate them Thank you very much
Thank you very much Madam President In our group we have described this government on different occasions as an autocratic totalitarian despotic manipulative and illegitimate government and many are the reasons and many are the different issues We have said of him that he is a government that promotes unconstitutionality as demonstrated in the states of alarm It is also a government that promotes hatred against everyone who disagrees with it especially against members of VOX and a government that practices and promotes sectarianism for example with its laws of gender ideology and historical memorylessness and of course with climate fanaticism VOX was right when he described the government as such and VOX is right when he says that in policy of ceses also of high offices what is the norm of this government is arbitrariness whim partisan actions or decisions and of course act to the dictate of what his separatist partners tell him or feminist movements and lobbies or external chavista pressures Today we talk about the purges of Sanchez I said purges someone will have heard fleas and will get nervous and the purges of a government against two types of people The list would be endless We could first of all talk about those who are loyal to Spain those who have been purged and stopped for defending the rule of law and legality We will remember Colonel Sánchez Corbí head of the UCO of the Civil Guard with thirty five years of unspeakable struggle against ETA who denounced that there were not enough funds to carry out the operations and was overwhelmingly ceased in August 2018 We could talk about José Antonio Nieto head of the work prevention services of the National Police Corps who reported that there was a potentially deadly situation with the pandemic that was stalking Spain calling itself an alarmist and was shut down in March 2020 We could talk about Colonel Pérez de los Cobos a man who stood out for his fight against ETA and was one of the best coordinators of the state security forces and bodies against the coup d'état of October 1 2017 who did not want to give you the information that you wanted and that you asked for information that could only be given to the judge because he was investigating the 8 M and the consequences of those demonstrations on the spread of the COVID and was completely ceased in May 2020 Recently we could talk about Juan Rodríguez Poo president of the INE of the National Institute of Statistics who gave the data of the CPI and GDP which did not like the government and was completely ceased And why not let 's talk about the reason for this proposal about Paz Esteban director of the National Intelligence Center whose coup partners said it could n't be that she was investigating the coup players mobile phones by court order And now let 's talk about the purges of those who did the dirty work to Sánchez González Laya Minister of Foreign Affairs who once he did the dirty work of bringing the terrorist leader of the Frente Polisario into Spain was stopped José Luis Ábalos Minister of Transport who did the dirty work of the suitcases of Vice President Chavista Delcy Rodríguez and was completely stopped Juan Carlos Campo Minister of Justice who carried out the pardons of the coupts and after doing so was stopped and Ivan Redondo himself who maneuvered in all these ceses and tejemanes and orchestrated all these maneuvers against one and the other and was then completely stopped By the way the list goes on and we already know who 's on it Minister Marlaska after you charge and discredit the state security forces and bodies you will be the next to be purged We have tabled an amendment calling for the necessary legal reforms to be made so that it is always necessary to justify before the various committees or before the plenary any termination of a high office because that is true democracy true transparency and accountability all the rest are the totalitarian purges of a totalitarian government like that of Pedro Sánchez
"Thank you very much Madam President Minister this urgent inquiry could have been carried out a month ago six months ago eight months ago a year ago two years ago and sadly if you continue in the government it would be repeated in two six or eight months or one year and it would be worse and worse We have already talked about this we have already denounced this but I will only refer to what has happened and hence its urgency in the last week When Mr Sánchez taught us about the importance in defending the borders of Europe when he denounced the illegitimate invading aggression of the satrap Putin only Santiago Abascal president of the political party that is already Spain 's second political force in intent to vote denounced what was happening at the same time on the borders of Spain an assault of 2500 illegal immigrants 450 of whom managed to enter Meanwhile her representative the government delegate in Melilla was calmly gathered to teach the Civil Guard commanders gender ideology lessons What a big issue when they 're assaulting a border The next day the minister on Thursday last week had already bet 4,000 illegal immigrants on the mountains of Morocco on the Gurugu From that assault of 1200 they managed to enter about 400 And just yesterday Minister they assaulted another 200 of those who managed to enter 50 Result almost a thousand illegal immigrants have entered absolutely violently across the southern border of Spain the southern border of Europe in Melilla There are half a hundred wounded agents and about 5000 white weapons have been collected by the State Security Forces and Bodies iron forks bars chains boats with live lime Minister I would like to speak today not for you who knows it perfectly well but for the Spanish political and public opinion on behalf of our group to denounce the ten flagrant lies to which your Government the partners of your Government the progress consensus and the media on pay of all of you reiterate over and over again First great historical lie Ceuta and Melilla are not Morocco Ceuta and Melilla have never been Morocco and Ceuta and Melilla will never be Morocco because before Morocco existed specifically 541 years before Morocco existed Ceuta was already part of the sovereignty and national territory and 460 years before Morocco existed Melilla was already a Spanish city Second big lie It is not true that they are peaceful refugees they are violent young people They are not women they are not children they are not elderly they are young violent perfectly organized who assault with rusty and sharp iron claws with chains with iron bars with live lime They are not as we are unfortunately seeing poor Ukrainians who fled women children elderly and sick from the invasion of Putin 's communist satrap They are perfectly organized young men of military age Third big lie It is not true that Morocco cooperates That 's not true Morocco is preparing and organizing the assaults as it pleases it according to two clear objectives The first you know it well Minister is economic blackmail to Spain Every time he pressures Spain they run out of the government to offer new sums of money such as the 30 million euros paid to him last year 30 million euros when there was an assault of 10 000 illegal immigrants in Ceuta or the 26 million that they have just approved for off road vehicles for the Moroccan government after the last assaults at the border And the second objective is the demographic pressure they carry out on Spanish cities to achieve an invasion by substitution so that there will come a time when the number of Moroccans in those cities is higher than that of Spaniards and to claim as their own cities that are not The CNI has already told us in a report which you know so well Morocco does not cooperate it is a latent threat Fourth big lie It 's not true that we have a secure border Only 850 meters from the 12 kilometers of the border of Melilla have the height of 10 meters and the sufficient control systems that avoid the jumps Those famous inverted combs that were going to put as a mid-coastal in the rest of kilometers have been put only in one part and in all the places where they are missing is where they have jumped In addition you know that there is a budget of 32 million euros What are they waiting for to execute him With 32 million euros the Spanish border between Melilla and Ceuta would be almost entirely shielded I say 32 million when I just mentioned that almost 50 million have been given to the Moroccan satrap Fifth lie It is not true that our agents are sure as much as you run down to take the picture with them neither the Civil Guard nor the National Police nor even the local police They have insufficient human resources even if you send in timely reinforcements There is no permanent supply they do not have riot control material they do not have vehicles with a water launcher they do not have the appropriate vests or regulatory helmets not a 20 year old helmets that break as we could see at the first blow with a chain they do not have passive safety they do not have adequate vests or anti-corruption material That 's why there are fifty officers injured Friday It is not true that they are humanitarian NGOs They are part of the human trafficking mafia that mafia you know that in Africa collects huge amounts of money from immigrants before the jump and their families in debt for life And then there are the pseudo NGOs on the other side doing the effect called and charging for every emigrant they pick up at the border There 's a business on one side of the border and a business on the other side They are the same the same NGOs that I could see the other day in Melilla bet on a small mountain waiting for the place of the jump because they know it perfectly and photographing and filming the actions of the agents who then properly cut filtering to the media only the part that interests them that is when the agents defend themselves from the brutal aggression that they are suffering with forks They are the same Minister the same pseudo NGOs that pressure governments to empty Melilla 's CETI yes the one they emptied a little while ago Do you remember Two unprotected ships that left the port of Melilla and went to the port of Malaga opened the door and released them there without any police control Do you remember It was 1500 You 've emptied the CETI I was there and the workers told me as soon as they empty the CETI there will again be assaults That said and done at two weeks they were jumping That 's the business they have that 's the effect called Seventh lie It is not true that the Armed Forces cannot have a very necessary and very proportional participation The Armed Forces Minister you know it too I have been told by the military commanders the police commanders regularly receive mass control courses have anti-disturbing material and are perfectly prepared in the Navy Infantry in Regulars in the Legion Why do n't you give the order so there 's 1500 or 2,000 soldiers with anti-disturbing material helping in the jump Eight It is not true that Ceuta and Melilla are protected by our allies in the North Atlantic Treaty It 's not And when we have recently requested in the Senate that a petition be made for its inclusion under the umbrella of Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty they have voted against his Government and all the partners of his Government It is not true that the Armed Forces on just reciprocity with their NATO partners are fulfilling the commitments of the Cardiff Summit to maintain a 2 defence budget Do you know what Morocco is in Yes you do It already carries 3.2 of annual gross domestic product in defence expenditure Do you know where Spain is You know that too We do n't get to 1.02 a year Faced with this violation of our defence capacity the enemies of Spain are also exploited Nine great lie It is not true that the media neither the 1 nor the 2 nor the Fourth nor the Sixth nor any with the exception of many exceptions are telling the truth They manipulate the images they take out only the court that interests them they never take out when the agents are assaulted and wounded And I ask you here publicly Minister to give the order that always not only when the situation is overrun all the images of the fixed video towers on the borders of Ceuta and Melilla which take out the helicopters of Civil Guard and National Police and especially that it equips all the agents of individual GoPro cameras so that they can film all the performances Tenth lie Minister It is not true that illegal immigration is good for Spain That 's not true They do n't come to pay our pensions they cost us a fortune They do n't bring wealth They do n't pay taxes They destabilise the labour market But that 's what the mafias are interested in because that 's how they have cheap labor to work in the field to work in the industry They are the new slaves of the 21st century In addition Minister the public services of the Spaniards are saturated hospitals health centres are saturated public security services are saturated because these public security services are needed The issue of illegal immigration is being addressed and other issues such as insecurity on the streets are being neglected In addition they generate insecurity And finally social services are also saturated Do you know what is true Minister Do you know what a fine truth is that neither your media nor your political propaganda will ever be able to shut up That you are doing a so called brutal effect that is calling on the whole of Africa to storm the border that you are unprotecting the borders of Spain and that you have therefore unprotected the Spaniards Thank you very much"
Thank you very much President For a moment I thought I was listening to the Australian Home Secretary talking about border security that there are no massive assaults that our agents are protected that there is nothing to fear You really can't have any more nerve when you come up to a rostrum But I will tell you once again Minister you suffer from deep political deafness But how dare you after I have manifested it twice here our president four and every spokesman who has intervened in any matter how dare you again bring out the stupidity the stupidity and the palmery lie that we applaud the invasion of Ukraine by Putin 's communist satrap But how dare you To be told is to the communist ministers of his Government who are trying to protect Putin To be told is to the Secretary of State of his 2030 Agenda which ruins farmers meets with Maduro and supports satraps dictators like Putin So stop making it up But you have a handheld which takes you there and it does n't matter what we talk about Take page one and start because the far right You 've said it five times Look if we are the far right you know well that we are not you are the ultra stupidity the high treason the ultra lie the ultra cynicism and of course several of your group and who support you the ultra communism and the ultra left Minister do you know what 's going on That there has been a time when that far right has applauded you when you have said the only truth in your whole speech copying us that the only legal immigration is the only good immigration the one that comes to the house knocking on the door the one that meets the legal requirements the one that does not hit the agents the one that does not assault the border the one that does not pull lime alive the one that has not been imposing its criterion by force That that legal immigration of course that 's the one we applaud the one that comes to generate wealth And by the way the only one who as a sovereign nation has the right to say when how many and who enter not the outside mafias who will tell us what immigration has to enter how much it has to enter and when it has to enter That is the difference between those who believe in the sovereign nation and the rule of law and those who are on their knees before the dictates of the globalists You have repeated to the satiety that you will not tolerate Look I 'd like to hear from you now when I come up that you publicly assume this commitment I 'm not going to tolerate Morocco any more collaboration with the assaults He wo n't get a euro or a million more if he allows the assaults again Secondly I am not going to tolerate another day without the entire Melilla fence having the 10 meters which is only 850 linear meters and I am going to build that useful necessary and waterproof fence Thirdly I will not tolerate another day when my National Police and Civil Guard officers are unprotected I 'm gonna give you the best stuff on the market in helmets vests vehicles I will not tolerate again that they are forbidden to use the anti-disturbing material they will be able to use tear gas they will be able to use rubber balls they will be able to use trucks throw water all the anti-disturbing material that is used around the world to contain the massive assaults I will not tolerate say it if you dare say it that not a single illegal immigrant who violently assaulted the border can stay in Spanish territory we speed up all legal procedures for him to be returned to his country of origin That 's what we want to hear from the Spaniards that 's what we want to hear from the agents and professionals who fight against the traffic mafias and the assaults But Minister if you do n't care what I can tell you you do n't care what I can explain to you Let 's see if you explain to the Spaniards whether carrying these sharp tipped iron forks that clave into our agents can be considered a legal and peaceful immigration Three thousand of these hooks have entered Spain
Thank you and I finish Madam President Look when I announced to my colleagues I 'm going to show you an image so that all the Spaniards can see it I said to them You 'll see how they 're going to give us the truth Thank you Socialist Members for saying how did you enter the Chamber with a weapon I mean they 're weapons I mean they 're astounding Thank you very much
Thank you very much Madam President The facts that we were able to see both in Melilla and through the explanations of the lieutenant colonel of the Civil Guard and from the vision of the different videos are as follows on 24 June there is a violent assault on the border of Spain the southern border of Europe perfectly coordinated massive and disproportionate to the number of our agents and provided in their response First an assault is not a legal entry it is not an entry allowed by a border crossing enabled for this purpose Therefore those who stress the need for attention to possible asylum applications are once again carrying out an obvious so called effect which says that any border can be assaulted by any point violently and that this gives them all kinds of rights Second it was a violent assault It was noted that once again and it is not the first Minister I myself in this rostrum presented to your ladies and gentlemen the forks before whom Members of your own party exclaimed how you are allowed to enter this Chamber with weapons axes electric radials forks sticks with sharp tips of iron and clubs all kinds of blunt material were used And he was violent also in the result fifty five officers wounded with bruises with breaks and one of them was unconscious Third it was a perfectly coordinated violent assault The image we have seen on other occasions It gives the impression that they had been instructed by military units Perfectly coordinated the advance changing successively the place of attack or assault some directing the assault others harassing the agents throwing stones throwing sticks on other occasions living lime others proceeding to the opening of the holes with radials and while some covered the front others working at the entrance and others proceeding to the massive entrance to the assault with the aim of reaching our territory In addition to coordinating the assault was absolutely massive It 's not random It is no coincidence that 2500 assailants decide to come one day at the same time and at the same point It is therefore an assault with a numerical superiority which they know perfectly well and which gives them a clear advantage over the security forces and bodies of the State which have the duty obligation and responsibility to ensure the security of all Spaniards and therefore to ensure our borders And fifth it was an absolutely disproportionate attack on the number because as I say compared to the 2500 assailants on the other side at the best of times adding to the Civil Guard the National Police and the local police there were 120 officers There were moments when we could appreciate in particular when they were breaking one of the doors as on one side on the side of Morocco there were about 1500 assailants and on the Spanish side only twelve brave agents of the Civil Guard And we defend the response of our agents once again as we have already had to defend in this very rostrum by referring to other assaults on our border and therefore assaults on our national sovereignty as we also had to defend from this rostrum their response to other assaults and attacks on our national sovereignty as was the coup d'état in Catalonia in 2017 where our agents also had to suffer that violence and that disproportionate number Mr Minister what you cannot say as Minister of the Interior is what you have just said that there were more than 120 agents and boasting about it I say there were only 120 agents in front of a brutal avalanche of 2500 violent assailants What you can't say as you just said was that there was an important deployment because there were drones a helicopter that had to leave the service to go refuel because there was no other one to support it and only 120 agents at best One of the great lies that you have given to those who hate Spain the separatists the thugs the friends of the terrorists is that they can go on saying that they had died in our territory I 'm going to tell you something that no one in this House has told you and that they probably wo n't tell you What if there were them what Is it that those of us who suffer an assault are responsible for themselves in that assault who die violent people whether our agents for saving their lives make legitimate use of force In this case there were no dead but believe me minister if there were no dead it was a miracle It was a miracle because in the face of a totally brutal avalanche they could have been killed in Spanish territory But here the dead those who appeared dead in this case yes were very alive and we could see in the images I will tell your lordships that they did not have the opportunity to see and all the Spaniards how some of those dead resurrected They had violently jumped the border and our agents tried to remove them from the accumulation of assailants By passing out they were placed on one side of the road so that the health services could come and oh surprise we all saw in the cameras how the slightest carelessness of our agents got up and ran out to CETI Those are the dead we had in our territory To all those who have accused our state security forces and forces I would like to hear them claim dead demand and denounce police violence and negligence against Morocco not our Civil Guard or our National Police The result Minister is that abandonment which you have been subjected to at the border with Spain because you tell me that there were 120 agents when as we have seen on the Moroccan side there should probably be between 500 and 600 agents Minister in an assault of 2500 illegal immigrants our forces and state security forces can say very loudly that they managed to get only six hundred to jump into Spanish territory and managed to return reject to 470 Thus of the 2500 only 130 managed to enter the territory and creanos if the Government were not theirs and ours of those 130 there was not one left right now in Spanish territory Minister I would like to end with two questions The first one of justice congratulating the forces and security forces of the State the Civil Guard the National Police and the local police of Melilla for their professionalism for their loyalty to Spain for their courage And I want to say to you Minister that you are not worthy of the magnificent agents we have in Spain That 's why you must resign And you must resign because you have abandoned them not because of the slanders that the coup groups terrorists and flounders pour against you and your Government but because you have abandoned our agents on the border with Spain Thank you very much
Minister once again in this House the seat of national sovereignty we are again witnessing the spectacle of the hypocrisy of progressive consensus which has been written on the agendas by the left the extreme left and the compounded right Always the same Agents who have been and have been assaulted are allowed to be alerted rather than to be held responsible for violent assailants Countries that have at least a seemingly democratic and free environment are pointed out and demanded responsibilities but countries that are dictatorships of corrupt people that have ruined and persecuted their people are never pointed out and are often caught up in the tragedy of fleeing from their own nations It is pointed out or forgotten with the 'something they will have done that they were victims of terrorism instead of pointing out to those parties that have protected financed or promoted terrorists or benefited from them It is pointed out demanded and claimed in the streets and in the stands in countries where there is equality at least formal before the law and non-discrimination on the grounds of political opinion sexual orientation or religious belief and it is never pointed out to countries that trample and despise women homosexuals or political dissidents or protest against them Always always the hypocrisy of progressive consensus What we point out in this rostrum and will repeat how many times it takes is that those responsible for what we are talking about here today are precisely those who facilitate favour and encourage the so called effect those who intend to enter are given the impression that they will receive financial aid free health care and social housing and that they will also be given nationality They are rights that many millions of Spaniards do not even have guaranteed It is responsible for those in the Government of Spain or the autonomous communities who give in to the blackmail of those countries Morocco Algeria or Mauritania who in exchange for not continuing to launch avalanches at our borders or jumping demand money under the excuse that it is to better combat those avalanches when we know that in the end they end up strengthening their armed forces with which moreover they threaten our sovereignty The aim of all of them responsible for this situation is nothing other than to try to achieve by the de facto or one day by law that the borders disappear and that there are open borders so that millions of people can move with complete freedom without any control thus destabilizing social and economic many countries among others Spain through what has already been denounced as active and passive as a genuine invasion by substitution and in addition achieving small profits through a cheap labour force Let it be clear that when VOX comes to the government we will pass an alien law in which those who enter Spain illegally lose all hope that they can stay that they will be regularised or that they will be given Spanish nationality We will truly strengthen the State 's security forces and bodies with more human material and greater instructions so that they can act in defence of our borders And our foreign policy will never reward the countries that drive such illegal immigration and those that really try to control it Thank you very much
Thank you very much Minister of the Interior Minister of the Interior who has viciously killed Judge Marlaska Why have you hidden that the Ministry of the Interior is in constant contact with representatives of ETA prisoners in order to meet their demands
They killed threatened and kidnapped everyone Minister of the Interior everyone But look denying reality as it strives to do does not hide the truth of that reality You have lied to this House denying that there were such contacts and now a report from the Civil Guard no matter how much you try to distort it shows that for three years now you have been in permanent contact with proeteran intermediaries directed no more or less than by the killer Kubati that multiple criminal who in his time demanded his attacks on the civilian guard barracks he said to achieve white coffins that is massacred children And with that gentleness you are exchanging messages messages visits assignments and requests for concealment by your ministry requests for concealment A wretched shawl wrapped in a treacherous secretism to the victims democracy and Spain And already the peak of defachability is that you before yesterday to try to justify yourself said that such contacts are normal institutional relations institutional relations he said of your ministry Look there is no greater shame or contempt for the intelligence of the Spaniards So Minister if you keep a minimum of decorum from what was Judge Marlaska do not have the indecency to repeat that there is no negotiation and that everything is being done in accordance with the law and in a transparent manner And of course then avoid this usual hysterical soflama trying to seek the applause of his own because neither his screams nor his noises can cover up the evidence that his unworthy immoral servile and tracer behavior has turned the Ministry of the Interior into the great cloaca of sanchism Thank you very much
Thank you very much Madam President Minister last week I gave you the opportunity to apologize to the victims of terrorism from here for insulting them by accusing them of lying and you preferred to get involved in a fallacious and ridiculous speech to avoid the issue as you have done again right now in addition to being a completely useless speech Minister Because I told you once and I repeat the difference between you and me is that I continue to defend the same principles that I have defended all my life and you who had passed them through the lining to remain a minister In addition Minister stop being a hero remembering that you were once threatened like everyone else because you yourself have recognized in many media that when you were no longer able to resist the pressure you put dirt through it and came to Madrid Here the only heroes the real heroes have been and are the victims and their families those to whom you have insulted for saying how they feel And Minister the victims have said literally that they feel deceived betrayed despised and abandoned by you and have said literally that it is unbearable for them to see how ETA 's criminal history is whitened That is why they have announced that they will never meet again with you again and that is why they will go out next Saturday to the street to tell this Government that everything is not right and to demand respect and justice for them By the way will you also accuse him of being troubled by the extreme right as they have done with farmers transporters and so many others Minister insulting the victims credit the total misappropriation of a minister of the interior politically
I wish Minister However reality says that you have deceived the victims of terrorism by negotiating with intermediaries the situation of ETA prisoners and a report from the Civil Guard has revealed it The bottom line is above and above the Ministry of the Interior insults them First the Secretary General of Prison Institutions who told the victims that this discovery of treatment with the representatives of prisoners is the same treatment that the ministry has with the victims institutional relations And when the victims expressed their indignation rightly so for such an answer that you try to equate yourself with the murderers you publicly insult them using them to lie Minister there is no greater vileness a miserable infamy and no Minister of the Interior had ever dared to commit such indecency But Minister the victims do not lie the victims do not lie when they report that this government has betrayed them because it has made an accomplice of a story that it does not want to distinguish between victims and executioners a dirty story and imposed by Otegi to try to whiten the criminal history of ETA However Minister in spite of your lies your insults and your disillusionment millions of Spaniards are not going to allow it Memory dignity and justice is the tribute of permanent gratitude that the victims deserve for their moral greatness and for their civic example This parliamentary group VOX has been and will be with the victims without reservations under any circumstances in the clear yesterday tomorrow and always and I recommend you Minister of the Interior that you now take the opportunity from your seat to publicly apologize to the victims for insulting them publicly by using them to lie Do it do it Minister of the Interior It is imperative that you assume that responsibility if you still retain it that I doubt it a minimum of decorum dignity and
Thank you Madam President Minister will there be a separatist referendum in Catalonia
Thank you Madam President Do n't you Well look I 'll answer him yes because it turns out that last week Junqueras explicitly announced that there would be that referendum and moreover he did it by walking around recalling all the promises that Sánchez had made and that he has not fulfilled in relation to pardons embezzlement and sedition And any consequence Minister that Sanchez has agreed with convicted criminals to impunity for the crimes committed and for those for which they may commit in the future because among other things in this very House they have announced that they will do so again So get out of the way and let 's get things in place You know that this separatist referendum is a key part of the coup that Sánchez and the separatists are giving against the Constitution and its ultimate foundation which is the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation and a coup that is also being fought against the separation of powers and the rule of law sponsored and promoted by the Government and its partners exerting unprecedented verbal violence against political opposition and judges Insults threats and lies to the left of the media Fortunately before yesterday the Constitutional Court resisted the instigation in defense of the law and fundamental law of parliamentarians and therefore today you announce a new assault again in law fraud and forcing the procedure because you know that submitting to the Constitutional Court is fundamental to Sánchez for many things and among other things to be able to convene the separatist referendum in Catalonia that Junqueras demands and announces So Minister ladies and gentlemen the blow continues Faced with this VOX will continue to fight to prevent Sánchez from stealing from the Spaniards the homeland coexistence democracy and freedom and also for him to have to answer to the courts for his faults Friday first chapter Spain will win
Thank you very much Madam President What we feared we did not know whether the Government was satisfied or not But to resume your expression look at you live Directly this government is a cancer and a scam Sanchez has no scruples or principles Your covenant that to which you refer with communists separatists and florets is humiliating and immoral It represents the miserable surrender to the continuous blackmail of those who call themselves enemies of Spain Threats deplanting demands that the Government swallow so as to maintain itself For example silenced by Otegi 's infamous decision to turn David Pla the last head of ETA into the leading leader of Sortu Bildu Is the Government satisfied with this contribution which expands the payroll of its interlocutors Minister it is an insult to the victims and a step forward in that dirty strategy of whitening the murderers with which the government compromises There is no greater indignity and shame That is why despite their demagogies their insidiousness and their lies there are more and more millions of Spaniards supporting that patriotic and social alternative that VOX represents with the will to prevent you and your partners from liquidating the unity and being of the nation and you will not achieve it Here without fear of anything or anyone to the clear live we will avoid it conscious of our responsibility and at this moment of our special duty with Spain because it is already more obvious than ever that today only remains firm strong and standing VOX to prevent it Take note
Thank you Madam President Minister without evasive only yes or no Is it the intention of the Government to agree with its separatist partners to hold a referendum in Catalonia
Minister your inability to give a clear answer increases suspicion Look we 're going to be clear on our part Amnesty and referendum are the two main demands of separatism None of them fit into the Spanish Constitution but of course that 's what Sánchez and this government care very little about Following the granting of pardons it is now proposed to grant a covert amnesty through the reform of the sedition crime reducing penalties in order to ensure that separatists awaiting trial do not go to prison that Junqueras and other pardons who will be able to resume office immediately and that fugitives abroad who may return to Spain without having to go to prison as Mr Puigdemont says which is what a government envoy has offered him Yesterday the Minister spokeswoman said that the reform of the sedition was a personal commitment of the President of the Government Hey is it also that agreed referendum that has again publicly demanded Pere Aragonese Is it part of that referendum of those secret agreements to which Mr Rufián referred a few days ago saying that it is already time to implement them Does this whole matter have to do with the Government 's haste to assault the majority in the Constitutional Court Look I remind you that the referendum agreed was until very recently the official position of the Catalan Socialists and that it remains today the official position of Podemos which is part of the government Fortunately there is very little time left for you to carry out that attack on the Constitution and national unity Within a year VOX will be ruling and then the law will be enforced and there will be no scoundrels with the separatists Meanwhile as long as that moment comes VOX has it very clear with Sánchez infinite distance frontal opposition zero dialogue Let 's see if others are beginning to understand the same thing for the best interests of Spain to avoid being cut off as in the last few days and not to have to make a fool of themselves
Thank you Madam President Minister why are you and this government unable to defend the Spanish borders
Thank you Madam President Minister we knew you were a bad minister but you have shown us today that as a diviner it is even worse The facts are the facts Inadequate material and human means temporary patching of troops when circumstances tighten as now inability to adequately defend our police and civilian guards because you forbid them from using anti-disturbing material and a systematic erratic policy turned into fact called are the causes of the events occurring at the southern border And the bottom line is that above all some of you allow yourselves to doubt the proven professionalism of our bodies and security forces It is intolerable that the Communist faction of the Government following the wake of certain NGOs serving the interests of the mafias demand resignation and investigation for what happened in Melilla It is absolutely intolerable it is inconceivable that you make certain statements simply trying to disguise reality to protect yourself It is inconceivable that the director general of the Civil Guard should stand in Melilla and recommend tranquillity because she says that according to her all the mechanisms of the State have worked perfectly when in just two days almost a thousand sub-Saharans have entered or that you dare to literally describe the policy with Morocco as perfect and adequate when the facts prove otherwise the police unions deny it and it is also known that in Morocco no one enters or leaves if Morocco does not want to Today there is an emergency situation on the southern border You know that it will be accentuated in the coming months and VOX already demands the deployment of our Armed Forces in defense of the southern border a policy of firmness with Morocco and the demand to NATO of the guarantee of defense of our cities of Ceuta and Melilla if that is the case That is essential as much as throwing this erratic and useless government away
Thank you very much Madam President We are talking today about Spanish Radio Television because it is a real scandal and it is a real scandal because this government is a real scandal because of its contempt for the laws and regulations of this House for its contempt for what this House represents for its contempt for the constitutional duty to submit to the control of representatives of national sovereignty Yesterday afternoon the Secretariat of State for Relations with the Courts sent a letter saying that it had the honour to request under Rule 188.4 of the Rules of Procedure of the Congress of Deputies the postponement of the question that we had put to the Minister of the Presidency today The Secretary of State for Relations with the Courts invokes the
The question Madam President is to denounce a trapide of this government such as those it is committing on Spanish Radio Television You have to motivate the cause as required by 188.4 for which the postponement is requested and you could not motivate it because you knew that the Minister of the Presidency would be you are present and that the Minister of Territorial Administration would be you are present to which you could have referred the question Look you guys
Thank you very much Madam President Look I am not going to fall into one of your provocations because a speech as miserable as yours believes that this government has nothing to say and lacks respect in an insulting way for this House which represents national sovereignty That is why with speeches like yours Minister it is understood that more and more Spanish households can no longer reach half a month and that the electricity bill the shopping basket and the price of fuel and very soon the rise of mortgages are dynamising the domestic economy of the middle and working classes in the meantime the government is dedicated to the absurd ridiculous pathetic and caricature insult as you have just done this morning and also to invent a parallel reality It has been seen again these days Minister with the measures adopted measures which are pure patchwork which do not respond to the structural reforms required by Spanish society and which are accompanied by an assault on institutions an assault on companies and more propaganda That is why Minister it is understood that the social climate is increasingly rejecting your management your futility your inability the scam you have made for millions and millions of Spaniards and of course speeches as absurd as pathetic and as ridiculous as the one you have just spoken No Minister here they still do not do a drastic tax reform to lower them to the benefit of those who have less and here they continue however to keep the continuous waste the rumor in occurrences and nonsense Therefore Minister as much as you do n't like it VOX will continue to defend your ideals clearly firmly with humility without scarecrows by standing by people 's problems and building a future in harmony in justice
in social progress and in freedom to which all Spaniards belong not like this government which for it only exists those who vote for it
Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Mr. Marlaska look at my flap Do you recognize this shield I suppose so though seen with your unworthy like you prison politics is a lot to assume I tell you this is the emblem with the coat of arms of Prison Institutions Do you know who it belongs to My father Do you know what it means what it represents Honesty something you lack to the point of satiety And you know why you took him today To portray from this rostrum the body of Prison Institutions in the face of its disastrous denigrating and sinister prison policy administration You have the medal to the bad merit of degrading an institution as noble and as sacrificial as it is that carried out by all professionals within prisons What an infamy his and that of his secretary general Ángel Luis Ortiz who have been able to sell themselves to the devil Let 's put a record on it It is well known that since his arrival in the Ministry of the Interior concessions have been made in relation to the approach of senior prisoners to Basque prisons and the granting of discharges without the mandatory technical reports of the professionals who according to the law must carry them out We also knew that ETA 's heirs in this Chamber are their partners to count on in decisive votes and it is that to you the acts in tribute to the members of ETA do not come or go to them when those tributes to ages is the murder to the memory and recognition of the victims of terrorism and it is the murder to the memory of those who cost them their lives the unity of Spain It was a cry to voices as I say imprisoned for political support it was a cry to voices imprisoned for budgets it was and is a cry to voices that who marked and marks the times is ETA And at the height of the senselessness in the last few days your department is the object of information that does not give rise to misunderstanding that you are the creator of the greatest betrayal of Spain the victims of terrorism and penitentiary institutions when it comes to the light that a report from the Civil Guard four hundred pages no more or less shame should give you that the armed institute for which you are responsible will bring to light your betrayals of Spain It is a report where the Benemerita accesses the messages between the environment of the incarcerated ages and the government even before its constitution and that it be her secretary general who before dating you prepared the meetings with the Kubati age As has been known the procedure includes the existence of a channel of communication between ETA and posts of the General Secretariat of Penitentiary Institutions to request a prison centre and progressions of degree were the petitions addressed by senior prisoners and in view of this you can no longer deny that your agenda that the agenda of the prison policy the agenda of your ministry and the agenda of the Government is managed by a chief representing extortion blackmail threat kidnapping and death There 's no doubt anymore Mr. Marlaska your boss is ETA Moreover his is unfortunately a policy that tramples on the pain of the victims of terrorism despises their suffering and incarnates the wounds that never heal from the car bomb from the shot in the back of the neck or from that bomb pack that came home And do you know why my father stopped putting this shield on his lapel even though he never did it in his heart Because ETA threatened him for years until he was sent a bomb package thirty years ago after he was transferred from the Rosales prison in Ceuta to the Salto del Negro prison in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria Mr Marlaska here is the key question do you know why ETA was chasing you For doing just the opposite of what you are doing for enforcing within prisons the Penal Code the Prison Law and the Prison Regulations for not giving a single privilege or special treatment to criminal gang killers Of course to comply with the law one must be honest and honest and to be honest and honest had its consequences Look I bring you here some examples of what those consequences were For example this circular was moving in prisons between prisoners of age Decade of the Nineties Esteban Nieto again resorts to the hunger strike as an extreme and last means in the face of pressure from a group of officials and the head of services García de Vinuesa for the continuous changes of cell caches and integral nudes Or this other information from the Diario de Las Palmas in reference to the blackmailers hunger strikes of ETA killer prisoners The Amnesty Coordinator sends a statement and the Diario de las Palmas echoes and says The policy of sanctions and caches is a new attack by the well known torturer and head of services García de Vinuesa Or this other information this other news from the newspaper Egin in reference to a statement that is called the Association of Relatives of Basque Political Prisoners The irregular provocations and actions that the prisoners suffer are directed by a chief of services named García de Vinuesa And look I 'm going to teach you this last one although if you like I later taught you a lot more a telegram of threats a common medium then saying We demand respect for human rights Basque prisoners or charge against your conscience State guilt You will know I imagine again that security measures i.e. prison population counts records searches searches controls cell changes are regulated in Article 65 of the Prison Rules and that they are internal security measures in prisons Paragraph 2 of the resolution states that the intensity of these measures will be in line with the potential perils of the inmates to be applied particularly in the case of inmates belonging to terrorist groups organized crime or extreme danger and that of course all those threats were nothing more or less to point out to the next one to include in the long list of Spaniards to be killed by law enforcement against benefits and favors sought by criminals as are now done by those same criminals and their heirs who want to break what is the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation That 's what you have to defend the law and order Mr. Marlaska from that you should know a little bit but you 've been able to rule the business with death a business that leaves the following figures since September 2018 There were then 232 inmates of ETA in Spanish prisons 227 of whom were sentenced and 5 prisoners and about 90 of whom were classified as first degree or closed regime In three years his negotiations with the protera world leave a current record that speaks of the 180 prisoners of ETA in first degree or closed regime no one is already serving their sentence under that regime Tell me Mr. Marlaska who are you with those who die or those who kill Where is the dignity left Mr Marlaska where is the decency of a minister when he is able to negotiate his chair and that of his president with statures and proteras to improve the situation of the murderers in prisons to give them benefits that they do not deserve in the form of release or rapprochement and you leave the law in the drawers of memory Although it is not the only thing that has been left on the road you too have left honor and dignity in the carpet corridors and have exalted even more what we all knew that proteras and murderers are the appendix that marks the course of a government with little scruple and no conscience Because you know I was a little girl when I saw my father lying on the floor to look under our car when I had to give every six months a phone number other than my friends and also when our car had a different license plate every certain time and I did n't understand anything a day when an artifact broke out in prison I saw the explosion from the prison staff pavilion where we lived at 40 meters the explosive charge went up to the sky Over the years I knew that with the threat we traveled from Ceuta to the Lucky in the hope of living without bullets in the back but from them we returned with the unnegotiable package of ETA which sought a price to pay that was too high do n't you think Mr Marlaska It was life And you and your government are able to agree on prison policy in relation to the prisoners of the terrorist organization ETA with the inherited formations of those bloody criminals in exchange for violating the memory of nearly 900 murdered including the brother and nieces of my dear colleague José Alcaraz and the son of Antonio Salvá Diego But also the memory of members of their ranks Have you forgotten the balance sheet of murder victims Have you forgotten the 80 kidnappings Because 532 days had José Antonio Ortega Lara kidnapped By the way do you know what I saw when I walked in and out of the prison where we lived I 'm going to tell you a cartel demanding the release of prison officer Ortega Lara I do not forget the minutes of silence of his companions at the prison gates asking for their freedom minute of silence week after week for almost two years A little bit of crime has its partners behind their backs This Government has now implemented a pro-terrorist prison policy against what has historically been carried out by the various governments when they were implementing an anti-terrorist prison policy Your duty in politics if you were a decent minister you who have lived threatened also many years what makes you even more unworthy if it fits is not to close your agreements with ETA Because those agreements are being closed by a traitor you yourself a minister of the interior and what you should do as I say as far as prison policy is concerned is to comply with the law So what measures are you going to take to prevent ETA from ceasing to decide on Spain 's prison policy Because I remind you Mr. Marlaska that forgiving terrorists is God 's business
Minister I have to tell you what a cowardly way to defend your prison policy His speech today is the betrayal of Spain You have wanted to justify the unjustifiable and the worst is that you know it even being a judge and knowing it and even though the National Court has revoked against the decision of the Interior the release of the Íñigo Gutiérrez era a decision of you against the unanimous vote of the professionals of the prison of Aranjuez who in your report pick up the risk of the medium high incidence and who as I say voted to keep it in second degree and even though last week the Central Court of Prison Surveillance of the National Court also revoked the third degree that the General Secretariat of Prison Institutions granted to the Crespo era because the National Court concludes that the Interior you granted him semi- freedom without the prisoner meeting the requirements And they are not the only ones since the National Court revoked a few months ago also a progression of degree to a terrorist granted by the Ministry of the Interior Do you remember To Unai Fano because the National Court considered that the granting of the third degree was premature and impropriety And above all you are not able to be a decent minister a whole person and leave because you have ascended to this rostrum defending the indefensible Denying evidence makes it even more unworthy Reiterating his lies makes him even more tracer Because it is traceable laclandestinity of its policy and its ambush to Prison Institutions and its professionals in addition to handling you do the pain of the victims of terrorism and that is what you have done in your intervention I deeply regret that I have no respect for all those who lost their lives by wearing a uniform to work with by being the children of those who carried it and all those victims who were not respected by their sacred right to live Today as at the time it is very expensive to defend our homeland and the law because in the face of the third degrees granted so far and which are being revoked by the National Court thanks to the resources of the Public Prosecutor 's Office what will your State Attorney General do in March in the election of the new Chief Public Prosecutor of the National Court Will this government again yield to pressure and blackmail by not renewing the current chief prosecutor and his prison coordinator prosecutor Are they going to take reprisals against them as ETA 's heirs are already demanding them to pave the way for the release of ETA prisoners Justify this The abertzale left mobilizes against the prosecutor who stops the release of ETA prisoners Justify it But Mr Marlaska in this bis a bis between you and me one thing has become clear that you do not respect so much blood spilled in the name of Spain that you only know how to cover up your shames as a minister with miserable speeches like the one you just offered us speeches that leave you in evidence leave you in evidence your lack of humanity St. Augustine of Hippo has already said where there is no charity there can be no justice Your intervention here today at the headquarters of the national government has been the intervention of a fugitive because you have defended here today your prison policy by favoring the hands they pointed out the bloodstained hands of the bloodthirsty terrorists of ETA and you have done so by saying that you have no escape that you do not get rid of the condemnation of being the greatest traitor to the victims of terrorism to their memory to the truth and to justice I will allow myself today to finish my inquiry as I began honoring the noble body of Prison Institutions so that the Virgin of the Merced her patroness will always take care of them and protect them especially while you are at the head of the Interior and honoring the hearts of the victims of terrorism honoring the dignity of their families because they know what they are wounded that they do not age and that of course today they cannot believe that destiny was to be this to claim to the Minister of the Interior of the Government of Spain justice and dignity in the face of treason and conspiracy Thank you very much
Thank you President Spanish this government has sold the soul of Spain to the enemy Good afternoon Mr. Marlaska how evil you are leaving everything in your pact with those who have no homeland no flag no values How bad they 're leaving everything in their pact with the disloyals to Spain This is a government that has given everything above and beyond the interests of the Spaniards above and beyond the unity of Spain to carry out its accounts The last act of extreme disloyalty surrender to eliminate the crime of sedition by camouflageing pardons to thugs And this after even trampling the memory in their rows of ETA assassins to stay in power You 've got to be too treacherous to betray even your own Your stand here today is the stand of the villains because you are recidivists in high treason to the state for now favoring coupsmen who threaten to rise again One cannot expect anything else from those who do not know loyalty to a flag the only one that welcomes all Spaniards and by which so many Spaniards have given their lives They do not know the nobility of the earth that they tread they do not know what attachment to the roots is They do not know what loyalty and loyalty to belong to a great nation Spain Because you get up here but you do n't tell the reality of your accounts to the Spaniards They talk about the welfare state when they refer only to their own they talk about great energy transformations but they prevent them from warming their homes They are put in blood Agenda 2030 and historical memory the one that wants to rewrite ETA without dissolving or condemning its hundreds of murders They do not tell you the real reason why you now repeal the decision of our Penal Code when it is the price that Esquerra assigns to your budgets to pardon your thugs right Minister of the Interior And the reality is that since you took over the interior reins the Basque Country has already transferred the powers to prisons The reality is that Interior has approached more than 360 floors In Basque prisons it has granted about thirty third degrees and the Basque Government has also granted thirty third degrees to mass murderers Because the reality is that the goal is to grant them semi-freedom and amnesty Say it do n't be a coward Mr Marlaska tell the Spaniards that that was the contract that was and is the transaction for a few more days in your chair And we are in the debate on Volume VI Section 16 Ministry of the Interior State question security of Spain and the Spanish It increased by 11 Is that Mr Marlaska your great commitment to the defence of our borders your great commitment to the fight against terrorism to the fight against drug trafficking to the fight against crime to strengthening with personnel and material means our State security forces and bodies on all these issues an 11 increase What a shame That 's right this government exponentially increases its share of immigration by 750 million euros increases the share to what they call equality by more than 570 million euros but Interior It has an increase of 11 basically intended for the energy transition of the General Administration of the State to which you have devoted most of your speech Therefore the question is as follows Our borders are being attacked not by hundreds but by thousands of immigrants since you arrived in the government and what have you done to protect the Spaniards from this invasion For the Minister of the Interior has dedicated himself to changing concertinas for inverted penalties and leaves some areas of the fence of Ceuta and Melilla without any kind of protection neither one thing nor the other It has not increased the staff of the Civil Guard or the National Police on either of the two borders of Spain of Europe with Morocco they have not reinforced them in protective material or in material means they have vehicles for scrap and barracks and police stations that fall to pieces in many places of Spain but you continue to suck from Agenda 2030 until we talk about security in our streets They have neighborhoods in Catalonia as is the case with La Florida in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat or areas that are already ghetto some neighborhoods of Santa Coloma de Gramanet that are very close to being fully controlled by the most radicalized Islam And in Ceuta there is El Príncipe and in Melilla La Cañada for example which are no zones in power where a State has been established within the State where Muslim immigrants have installed their customs their norms their culture where the police cannot enter minister Barrios where the police and the Civil Guard are stoned because the goal is to install Islamic law Shariah And you meanwhile your government you continue to suck Agenda 2030 open door policies and multiculturalism And if we 're talking about prison institutions there 's nothing about increasing investment to give their officials more material nothing new in their security And meanwhile they keep waiting for you to be able to push him that you promised them to make them agents of authority And here in addition to the fall of Agenda 2030 fall of political criteria in the granting of third degrees and transfers of terrorists to the Basque Country In short we are faced with budgets that are the budgets of the high treason of the Government the budgets of ideological corruption of the submission to blackmail and of political concessions in a question of unquestionable relevance such as public security where gender ideology climate phobia the promotion of mass immigration uncontrolled and that only causes chaos have more weight than the security of the Spaniards when what the Spaniards need is more equality yes among the Spaniards who see for example how depending on where they live they have more or less quality in education or health or who may or may not speak in Spanish which is the official language of the State What the Spaniards need is more security and defense yes on our streets and our borders What the Spaniards need are not pacts with separatist phylotterrorists and couplists but more unity of Spain minister and less Agenda 2030 less murderous and poisonous snakes less multiculturalism and more identity
And more Spain more Agenda Spain For Spain and for the Spaniards
Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Do you know what a father who is a prison officer does before he goes to his job in prison to do his shift He kisses his kids thinking he might be the last Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Group how mediocre you have always been and continue to be with prison officials They refuse in the Senate to consider our bill to have their own statute and today they offer them as if they were doing them a favor when it comes to justice to be recognized as agents of authority By the way this was the first bill that the VOX Parliamentary Group registered in Congress in the XIII Legislature And these officials by the way today I see some of them up there in the guest gallery what an honor your presence have always been so abandoned so orphaned and neglected that today they conform to the fact that this proposal is a step towards obtaining their legitimate and just demands to get out of the bars to which they have always been subjected from the perpetual imprisonment of being released for dealing with such a hard job in which they have to endure sticks guarding detainees prisoners and prisoners hating the crime but pitying the offender for achieving the re-education and social reintegration of these criminals And all this without you complying with the General Prison Organic Law article 80 of which you are amending today because in the face of ills the lack of personnel does not allow the opening and coverage of all units and modules with the mandatory security and organizational measures and therefore they leave prison officials in the bad weather when only one official without means has to take charge on many occasions of units or modules with hundreds of prisoners and when those officials precisely belong to the collective of the General Administration of the State that suffers the most aggressions With a bit of luck that father will return home alone with some wounds or with a scaly arm after signing in the service book to give relief that there has been a new altercation with mutiny cone that there has been aggression against him or some of his companions that there has been an attempt to rape a female officer that one intern has tried to commit suicide but that there has been luck and they have managed to save him that another has burned a mattress to make it burn or that another intern has had to be transferred to the isolation module due to manifest aggressiveness That is the day to day in any prison in Spain under leaders who carry a catastrophic prison management You and when you ruled the People 's Party have dedicated themselves to building macro prisons with all kinds of luxuries for inmates while prison officials have no means do not have enough staff and therefore some of their macro prisons are 50 of their opening and do not have security The Ministry of the Interior has normalized this so much that being a civil servant is very expensive Hey being a prison officer is paid with assaults The Ministry of the Interior has normalized this situation so much that being an official already agonizes in prison institutions because they cannot continue to hide for longer the ill treatment they have been subjected to prison officials after decades because they have been in the most absolute silence and exile Humiliation of these professionals is usual because you have not avoided it on the contrary you have motivated the prison officials to have been accused discredited intimidated denigrated and denounced thanks for example to the order of internal service in which the presumption of veracity was given to the simple word of the prisoners who denounced torture when the attacks within the Talagos in prison jargon are not the exception but are the norm Now yes you have thought of throwing a half cable at them in the rattaneries of your bad consciences because explain to me if not why you do not want them to have a regime as you have explicitly acknowledged It is done by the teaching staff the research staff the health care staff the local authorities the foreign service however the officials of the penitentiary institutions no they put their efforts and their dedication to the commendable work of custody and reintegration of inmates at the expense of their physical security What do we call this I 'm telling you discrimination But Socialists the problem is not going to end with the amendment of Article 80 of the General Prison Organic Law they propose no matter how much smoke they try to sell To make them agents of authority is justice but of course it is insufficient Look I 'm not shutting things up much less when in my veins there 's the blood of a prison officer when you 've dedicated yourself to bringing terrorists closer to Basque prisons to excusing them to granting third degrees against the criteria and agreements of the treatment boards when you 've transferred to the Basque Country the powers in prison matters to finish fulfilling the objective agreed with the heirs of those assassins who are your partners in this House as a culmination of their betrayal of Spain and the victims of terrorism and when they allow tributes to those assassins of ETA For all this perhaps I should treat you today because your lack of respect for those who were killed kidnapped threatened or injured by the criminal gang ETA does not make you deserve to sit where you are nor of course the treatment of lords neither you nor your government partners nor even the heirs of ETA because you have shown no scruples nor piety nor honor and of course no loyalty to your homeland Thank you very much
Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen In case there 's any doubt the facts Today we are going to rat out unravel and unravel Mr. Grande Marlaska 's lies from this rostrum last week He repeated to us twice that third degree progressions granted by penal institutions to different ages were based on legality judicial control and that even third degree progressions had been made by judicial decision against the criterion of penal institutions He referred specifically to terrorists José Pedro Pikabea Ugalde Juan Carlos Herrador Pouso and Antonio Troitiño He lied to the Minister of the Interior in a deceivable and deliberate manner at the parliamentary seat because indeed José Pedro Pikabea was progressed third degree in February 2019 when the central judge of Prison Surveillance estimated his appeal for reform against two resolutions of the General Secretariat of Prison Institutions but what he forgot to tell the Minister in a crooked manner is that those resolutions of the General Secretariat denying the progression to the third degree of this age were January and March 2018 that is when he ruled the People 's Party and were neither he nor his interlocutor with the representatives of the prisoners of the age Mr Angel Luis Ortiz But if the defachation with which he lied did not seem enough he came to give us another example that of the age Juan Carlos Herrador Pouso who following his road map with the heirs of ETA has moved on two occasions within a little more than a year from the prison of Ocaña I to the prison of El Dueso in Cantabria and from El Dueso to Bilbao Grand Marlaska said that it had been progressed in August 2020 by the Central Prison Surveillance Judge contrary to the general secretariat 's approach And here comes the height of indecency and its indignity because this age is not that it has not been advanced to the third degree by the central judge against the criterion of Prison Institutions but that until today it remains in second degree Thus once we have found that for the Minister of the Interior the gifts that come from justice and truth are not superior to those that originate in the conspiracy fact that we could also verify in his intervention among other calumnies Grande Marlaska said that ETA does not direct the prison policy because ETA no longer exists tell me ladies and gentlemen what does that statement have when I look at the front from here and see five ETA heirs sitting at the seat of national sovereignty which confirms what we have been saying for all time that ETA is in the institutions and that it is the government of Pedro Sánchez with his Minister of the Interior at the head that whitewashes assassins and protera to remain on the throne of indecency Look where in the end it turns out that a minister of the Interior who must ensure the legality and full compliance with the sentences imposed on the prisoners of the terrorist gang ETA is dedicated to treating with undeserved courtesy terrorist prisoners bloody criminals from the General Secretariat of Prison Institutions and it is that according to us in response to our inquiry second degree approaches and progressions occur in law enforcement and judicial control a perverse statement because both approaches and second degree progressions occur without respect for the technical reports of the treatment boards In addition the minister had to cite the impossibility of appeal by the prosecutor 's office since these are progressions which are subject to the central judge of prison supervision only by means of appeal of the prisoner and of course in the face of a progression of degree no prisoner will appeal The same applies to the transfer of prison facilities which are not judicialized without the will and appeal of the prisoner because there is no appeal by the prosecutor 's office Therefore here comes as a ring to the finger that accomplice and murderer go in the same way In the hangover of immorality in which Mr. Grande Marlaska lives permanently he rejoices in deception and also denies that there is a underground channel of communication between the Ministry of the Interior through its general secretariat and representatives of the terrorist organization ETA and its political arms as reflected in the report of the Civil Guard by all known In the same misdemeanour the same day that from this rostrum denies any preferential treatment to ETA prisoners the Public Prosecutor 's Office of the National Court resorted to the third degree progression granted by Prison Institutions to three other ETA prisoners after it revoked three third grades for improper premature or contrary to the criteria of the treatment boards He did not count the unworthy Minister of the Interior with so much stone on his way to the last end that of the release of ETA terrorists the last end of his coronation as the greatest traitor to Spain and the victims of terrorism It is clear that Mr Marlaska will not stop lying until he has completed his collection the collection of third degrees and approaches promised in exchange for the heat of phylotterrorists in the whole valley so as to finish the most desolating legislature in all history But to the dirty rags of its failure out of disloyal prison policy granting third degrees and benefits to terrorists along with the degradation to the professionals of penal institutions to which by inertia it had already abandoned combined with the permissiveness shown in the face of the celebration of acts of tribute to those condemned for terrorism and betraying the victims we must unite its inability to placate the crisis of citizen insecurity throughout Spain its disastrous management in one of the biggest migratory crises that are remembered on the Spanish coasts and also the invasion of Ceuta in May 2021 And more Mr. Marlaska 's dirty rags Among them the destabilization of our State Security Forces and Corpses and their contribution to their expulsion from the Basque Country and Navarre Anybody got any more Because I will not be denied that there are grounds for public reprobation and the immediate dismissal of Mr Grande Marlaska as Minister of the Interior which is what we urge in this motion to the Government Because it is more than well founded that the chains of slavery must be removed from Spain with terrorists before arbitrary decisions and with criteria exclusively for political support And because a minister
"Thank you President Thank you President for appearing once again in this House although the truth is that you do not rent your winnings because it does n't matter what you come to talk about and what you come to propose because you always get the same from the right a rosary of disqualifications and not a single proposal In fact this very morning he said he was also listening to the insults of this bench No wonder because one is the only thing he does because it 's the only thing he knows how to do insult disqualify and scream Anti-politics That 's right all very moderate all very constructive High level high altitude policy for times of difficulty The more unity is needed the more efforts are needed the more important the political cohesion of our country in order to face a crisis the worse it is not that the right is not is that it is not even expected I know that they are having a hard time because it is very hard to assume that the policies the answers that are being given to the crisis in the European Union and in Spain in essence are an amendment to the whole of everything that they imposed on us in the previous crisis The president has started speaking for Europe Let 's talk about Europe In the previous crisis politics in Europe was dictated by black men who imposed on us all the commandments of neoliberal catechism that you so much applaud It came to be called austereicide And the invisible hands of Adam Smith who have names and surnames played with the lives of millions of people and left entire countries especially the countries of southern Europe to their fate Fortunately we have moved from neoliberal catechism to the social democratic exit And I can proudly say even with pride of country that virtually all the policies that the European Union is defending in order to deal with the crisis have been put on the table by our President Pedro Sánchez Because if more than EUR 700 billion is allocated in Europe today so that member countries can help their citizens and transform their economies it is because Pedro Sánchez has been calling for a new European Marshall Plan from the minute on The PP went to Brussels to boycott and ask that the funds not reach Spain It was Pedro Sánchez who proposed to take the gas price on the electric bill and got the Iberian exception And that is what Europe wants to do today everywhere except the People 's Party which says that if they rule in Spain they would take it away Pedro Sánchez was the one who talked about intervening in the energy market and that is what is being studied at the moment but to Mr Feijóo this seems to be a Stalinist measure It was the President who proposed a temporary tax on big fortunes and big companies and that is what the European Central Bank and just yesterday the International Monetary Fund said Dangerous Communists But this the leader of the opposition seems to him to be killing his rich friends Even when the contingency plan was proposed to save energy that today corrected and increased is the one that exists in all European countries you said that of Madrid does not go out in a statement of your solidarity with the whole of Spain and Europe That 's what they do with everything In short policies in the European Union today are defined by the leadership of Pedro Sánchez The People 's Party has been left alone in Europe today and has simply done the ridiculous thing which is just what is not to be done in politics as Tarradellas said But here in Spain there is more of the same Let 's compare In the 2008 crisis the PP Government cut welfare public services and 8 billion more in social policies by 27.3 billion When unemployment increased benefits and unemployment benefits were cut by more than 15 leaving those who had lost everything helpless He made a labor reform that reduced dismissal and of course he got fired and that with garbage contracts with wages of misery he got seven million working women and poor workers in Spain Pensions rose by 0.25 and while the pensioners lost purchasing power one year yes and another year more than €60 billion was emptied that left the evil government of Zapatero in the Social Security hut He cut scholarships in research in investments But that however much they repeat the opposite now and again has raised all taxes all of them especially VAT which is the one that most affects the middle classes and the working classes He even set a sun tax and in addition increased public debt in Spain by more than EUR 500 billion In other words it cut the welfare state and public services to pieces it emptied the pension hut it lowered the wages of public employees it cut dependency social benefits until it left them in the bones it abandoned the productive economy it raised all taxes and still increased the public debt by 30 Do n't tell me you do n't have to have a special skill for this This is indeed the economic miracle of the People 's Party In the previous crisis the People 's Party cut everything it could and then gave it to the banks That 's the Spanish right save the capital and abandon everyone else What a difference and pride for progressives to have a government that radically does the opposite that implements radically different measures and policies The latest measures are contained in budgets that allocate more than EUR 275 billion to social investment to strengthen the welfare state and public services to protect citizens and to combat inequality Never in history has so much money been spent to help people in Spain But there are also more than 30 billion for the change of productive model 16,300 in R D+i 12 000 in real investments Mr Esteban I am also not going to talk about budgets because they will have their time and debate but it is clear that the big numbers tell us that these are the accounts that Spain needs by 2023 because they protect citizens middle and working classes weave the largest solidarity network ever seen for the most vulnerable help the productive economy to continue creating wealth and employment in Spain and transform the country to make it greener more digital more competitive and more self sufficient First of all what has it occurred to you to say to the right You put an alternative on the table Have you made any proposals What 's going on They have said that they are electoral budgets and that they are made to buy votes But is that really a great contribution to what Spanish society needs in times of crisis How far does your great solvency your good faith go Is that how you want to be an alternative As the Secretary General of Workers Commissions said Unai Sordo but who do you believe to consider that pensioners public employees fellows dependents the unemployed all those who benefit from these budgets are like lambs who have their vote for sale and are offered to the highest bidder But what country do they live in Maybe they 're too used to buying wills with envelopes and that 's how it goes By the way I have to repeat something that the President of the Government has already said and that they are not going to like anything all this is going to be financed with European funds and taxes Yes with taxes with progressive taxation that constitutional concept that you like so little and that just means the more you have to contribute And since you do n't like it you despite the blah blah blah blah where you rule have done just the opposite you have used the taxes so that those who have more have more While giving gifts to those already privileged they cut off the welfare state and public services which are the guarantee that everyone else can face a minimum of certainty and dignity in the career of life Because without public health without public education without a public pension system without social benefits there is no equal opportunity Social democracy always understood that a person cannot be free or equal if he is a slave to necessity From there emerged the welfare state after the Second World War to provide to meet the basic needs of a defeated citizenship Because yes Mr Abascal it was the social democracy that set up the welfare state and all you want to do is destroy it In addition middle classes exist because there is a welfare state because it is public resources that bear large social costs and enable middle classes to save and prosper I 'm just going to give you a piece of information so you can understand this A family in which parents have completed a career at the public university and their two children involves an investment by the State in education and health over their entire life of more or less EUR 1 300 000 Could you pay it with your taxes in your pocket For that is the real middle class financed by the solidarity taxes of all if not it would not exist That 's the middle and working class you do n't defend because you 're demolishing the welfare state that makes it possible and you do it because your bet is another your model is private insurance private schools private pension plans everything for your friends to do private business with public needs A very clear example is Madrid the community where less public money is invested in health and education but where more is spent on private health Fortunately the progressive government is the great advocate of the public and uses taxation to fight inequality redistributes resources so that it has more people who need it most and distributes the burdens so that it provides more people who have it most Tax justice to achieve social justice Because we are not going to allow the progress of a few to walk on the misery of many which is what you seek permanently And if not we see it Andalusia where they have forgiven the wealth tax to the great fortunes is on the line in health investment and the new school year has started with almost 1200 fewer classes in the educational centers and half of the places to strengthen teachers In Madrid Ayuso 's tax haven there are 37 emergency primary care services that have been closed for two years have fired more than 6000 health care workers and the course has started with 1000 places of secondary school teachers less In Galicia in Feijóo where they want to improve the 7,500 people who have a wealth of more than 6 million to pay half of what they pay now they have closed almost 150 schools cut 900 hospital beds and more than 1100 health personnel I could go on but this is the cruelty of the truth their joyful tax cuts to those who have the most are cutting off the dignity of everyone else 's lives And the question is why do you think it 's okay for them to always lose the same ones Why do sacrifices always have to fall on the same backs The answer is very simple because they are not yours Do not come to me with empty words or empty speeches the facts are there to prove what I say ERTE against labour reform against rise in the interprofessional minimum wage against increase in scholarships aids to transport and transporters bonus for rent cultural bonus against minimum living income against rise in pensions with the CPI against By the way do n't be fooled anymore by this matter because your leader Mr. Feijóo uses peripheral phrases to escape when asked about pensions But in my village it is said white and bottled You do not want to raise pensions you want to lower pensions with the excuse that they are not sustainable but say it at once They have protested against everything that has helped the citizens of this country that is they have not defended workers they have not defended pensioners young people women and families And I am not going to say that they have not defended anyone because they have defended someone they have defended the usual the privileged the powerful But the reality without laughing is here When they push the button and say temporary tax on energy and financial companies they vote against temporary tax on big fortunes against Iberian exception which has saved 10 billion consumers against sometime will bill more against the fact that corporation tax is approaching the nominal against the fact that taxation is not based exclusively on labour income It does n't matter what they count The facts show that even though they say they represent their millions of voters they do not represent and defend more than 0.2 of the country 's citizens Fortunately the Government is concerned and concerned about all others There is not a single person in Spain who has not been benefited by any measure of this Government except the friends of Mr Espinosa de los Monteros as he told us the other day The rest all of them Ladies and gentlemen this is the people 's government a government to protect and transform and a government that despite its shrieks has the backing of the social majority of this country and will continue to do so"
"Thank you President I 'll tell you in a lower tone so Mr. Abascal does n't get infected I wish I had been because I was going to give him the reason but you can tell him I totally agree infinite distance We 're in the antepods at all You defend dictatorships and dictators we defend democracy and freedom Point I have nothing more to add Mrs. Gamarra I 've been listening to you attentively throughout the day and you seem to me to be inside a dystopic series in which everything has turned around and we are in the world backwards You have begun with a sofa and with all your stands intoxicated representatives of the only party condemned as a criminal plot organized by the delinquent And I do n't say it the sentence says it Would n't they be a little quiet Then he came with the typical cheap demagogy it is that the president has raised his salary Yeah You know what the president 's paying for do n't you Can you tell us what Mr. Feijoo is paid to compare because they have hidden it from everyone I mean live transparency and live the difference He then said that one thing was to take care of the institutions and another was to assault them as the Government did Can you tell me what it 's like to be four years out of line with the Constitution to continue controlling the judiciary Can you tell me what it is to try that what the citizens have not given you in the ballot box will be given to you by the close ones in the sentences because that will not be to assault the institutions but it looks a lot like occupying them anti-democraticly He later said that this Government had raised taxes and the President had already replied Look you say you 've received 27 billion more at the cost of inflation Already but more than 35,000 have been earmarked to help the citizens of this country By the way the debt this year in the budgets seems to be going to fall by 3 You tell me when you went up all the taxes cut all the benefits and increased the debt to what do you allocate the resources because you did not appear anywhere I told you before they cut and cut and everything was given to the banks And then the pensions Beyond the chatter in the only interview in which Feijóo has not gone in the peripheral phrases he said textually that he was against raising pensions with the CPI Point That 's right as it was hard to swallow then they wrapped this up by confronting the pensioners with the young people and saying it was n't sustainable But of course the solution for the right is always the same to cut pensions instead of looking at how to make the system sustainable the same as in the labour market where the only thing they do is to reduce layoffs and lower wages This is his recipe always to attack the most humble to sustain the wealth of a few And one thing to finish and this worries me very much that I will also say in a low tone You have said again here and they say it in every control session that this government cannot go out on the street What is he trying to say that a democratic government because you do n't like it ca n't go free on the street No no I 'll finish the reflection"
What are you doing Inciting some citizens to multiply what you do here What are they trying to feed those ultra groups that first scream and then attack Nothing fancy nothing 's free You can't go up here into this rostrum and say what you want because everything has consequences It is very dangerous and very worrying this patrimonial drift from the right which wants to remain with the symbols with the homeland with the Constitution with democracy That is why every time you show your lack of sense of state going through Europe to speak ill of Spain and this government every time you show your lack of democratic culture saying that this government is little less than an okupa every time you show your patriotism as a reddish bracelet thinking that if everything goes wrong you will be well we will be in front in front because unlike you we work for Spain to go well because this will be good for all of us And it is that the socialists I finish because I do not have time if we have to endure we endure if we have to resist we resist But I want to make it clear to you we were neither born to endure nor to resist we were born to change things we were born to transform unjust realities and as Ramón Rubial taught us to make revolution in the State Official Gazette which is what this government is doing for the pride of all socialists
Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon Here we are again the government electing Barabbas There are 379 unsolved ETA attacks This is about 50 of the murders of the bloodthirsty Etraras among them the one that cost the civilian guards Diego Salvá the son of my colleague Antonio Salvá and Carlos Sáenz de Tejada in Mallorca in 2009 Unsolved crimes That does deserve a commission of inquiry Until a few years ago they were gunshots to the back of the head car bombs kidnappings and extortion Today extortion remains part of his modus operandi The method of extortion is recorded by the comrades of these assassins on fire in this House because Bildu here in the seat of national sovereignty together with independenceists separatists and coupsmen uses a perfect machine of extortion consented to the Government that arrives to this day with this new proposal with this new initiative and brings it among other forms a screen of hatred to Spain the party whose spokesman was sentenced to prison for the exaltation of terrorism when she was editor of the protera newspaper Eguin But Bildu is not the only party that makes this request for the creation of a Commission of Inquiry This initiative also brings her Republican Left with several of her leaders condemned by the Supreme Court and therefore imprisoned for a coup d'état in the illegal referendum of October 1 2017 the party that governs a coalition executive with Junts presiding over a government in Catalonia that is a government in rebellion refusing to abide by court sentences And this initiative is also signed by Esquerra 's partners in the Catalan government the party of Laura Borrás accused of prevarication fraud misappropriation of public revenues and documentary falsity Frankly this would be enough to put an end to this debate and to announce that we refuse to support this proposal because of the lack of moral legitimacy of its proponents That 's why and because this is another one of his letters of his Machiavellian game of stone throw and disarm the State and attack and discredit the forces and security forces of the State using the institutions But since the misconceptions are numerous and act as an aggravating factor we will continue to derail more folly to support our refusal ETA has not said the places where they hide hundreds of weapons and with a lot of explosives That does deserve a commission of inquiry Cases of abuse of the girl wards in Baleares Valencia and Las Palmas abused under the institutional guardianship of the Socialist Party Podemos and Compromís This is juvenile corruption That does deserve a commission of inquiry The network is spying on children in Catalan school recesses to find out what language they speak That does deserve a commission of inquiry And you know what a commission of inquiry deserves The heinous strategy of the Minister of the Interior to bring terrorist prisoners closer to Basque prisons authorizing in these years up to 345 transfers in favor of two hundred years that killed almost three hundred people As I say that does deserve a commission of inquiry And when the government gave up prisoners for budgets when the government is able to discredit the National Intelligence Corps we the VOX Parliamentary Group would like to know in exchange what the support of the Socialist Group which through an amendment is already positioned to support this Commission of Inquiry because we already know that this government is only being blackmailed by terrorists independenceists separatists and coups Today with this request from the Commission of Inquiry and its defence for those parties that embody hatred of everything that sounds Spanish we are witnessing a real deterioration of politics and institutional destabilization that we have come to repair in VOX To finish two messages Mr President ladies and gentlemen you should seriously consider whether the best thing you can do is get out of the way Their lack of legitimacy and their own dirty rags have left them at zero in their own request for the Commission of Inquiry Overcome failure you have devoured yourselves And ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Group stop arming those who want to destroy our homeland stop turning themselves in to the enemies of Spain stop being the necessary co-operators of terrorists and coups to break Spain stop choosing Barabbas Thank you very much
Thank you President I will start with something that may be surprising because it has little to do with budgets or yes but that really worries me and I think that we should also worry everyone except some You see the consideration of sesoso politics always has on a fragile balance and needs a permanent exercise of prudence and wisdom which sometimes is difficult to maintain but which is essential especially if we want the social pedagogy aspect that always has to hold politics to be aimed at extending tolerance protecting our diversity and plurality strengthening the coexistence of those we are different from but we want to pursue a shared path Therefore we must move away from the flames that point to enemies and seek only confrontation and social fracture Cohabitation policy or confrontation policy That is why ladies and gentlemen of the PP of the few who are because you usually come here let go of it and then leave if you share this which is basic in politics the conclusion can only be one Mr García Gallardo cannot remain a minute longer as vice president of Castile and León Mr García Gallardono can have no public institutional representation for the sake of politics and our country And it 's in his hands only in his hands Be up to what the moment we live in requires for once Now yes now yes good morning minister In these days of budgetary debate we have been able to see clearly the two ways of understanding politics in this House On the one hand it is those who understand that politics is the tool
that allows you to respond to the problems the ones that make arguments and on the other hand there are those who scream yes On the one hand we are the ones who understand that politics is the tool that allows us to respond to the problems that citizens have There are groups which when times of difficulty are experienced open up to dialogue and negotiation in order to find the best solutions to our country 's socio-economic problems The first thing I want to do therefore is to thank those groups that make up what has been called the investment block because their gesture of not submitting amendments in full opens up that space and that time necessary to seek agreement on the budgets that are at the heart of the proposal for economic transformation and social protection that the progressive government has set aside and contains the measures that together with these groups we have been adopting here in plenary after plenary Therefore we have the hand to look for that agreement that will allow us to finally achieve the budgets that will make those policies that we have already adopted here a reality On the other hand there are the advertisers of the apocalypse negators of everything and contributors of nothing That 's the reality I 'm not insulting Denialists of everything and contributors of nothing You see these budgets allocate EUR 275 billion to unprecedented social investment in our country EUR 275 billion is dedicated on the one hand to strengthening public services and social protection policies that make sense to our welfare state and on the other to making more of the solidarity network that we have in order to prevent anyone from being abandoned to their fate That is why there are the resources so that our pensions go up with the CPI and our older ones do not lose purchasing power there are the resources for young people to have help to rent a flat and have more scholarships and higher ones to relieve their families and they can continue and complete their training the resources that allow workers to have free transport to their workplace the aids for families without resources to have a minimum living income measures to keep them out of the light the attention that the dependents do not die in the limbo of waiting without the help they deserve by law and the unprecedented investment in primary care and education As I say it is an unprecedented social investment in the history of this country But in addition the budgets contain the resources that will enable Spain to be modernised and begin to update our productive model more than 16 billion in R D+i in real investment 12 000 the great commitment to ecological and digital transformation the destination of European funds aid to self employed people and SMEs It could be what 's left of tomorrow but the minister has already done it these two days with much better precision than I have By the way I have to thank the minister for the effort of budgetary pedagogy which has led to her almost losing her voice Thank you Minister because this saves me from derailing one game after another games that show that this Government is moving forward with a firm step in its three objectives protecting Spanish citizens and not abandoning anyone transforming the country to achieve a greener more digital more competitive strategically autonomous Spain and at the forefront of what is happening today in the world and fairly and equitably distributing public resources and also the costs and burdens of the crisis three objectives protecting transforming and distributing in a fair way which we should all share But no this is where the apocalypse advertisers appear Therefore the first horseman of the Apocalypse they seek to frighten people by constantly repeating that this government is generating an unorbited public debt that will have to be paid by the next generations and the next ones Okay Can you tell me who will pay the 500 billion euros I repeat 500 billion euros of debt generated by Mr Rajoy 's time Are you going to pay for it by cleavage or are we already paying for it this generation and the next Because if you 're going to pay it I 'm quiet but if we 're paying it now and we 're going to keep paying it it 's you who have to shut up Some data to clarify your brilliant management From 2011 to 2018 public debt in Spain increased by 43.63 four times more than in the rest of Europe increased debt its most beloved leader Mr Rajoy However from 2018 to 2021 with Pedro Sánchez the debt in Spain has increased by 17.83 2 more than the European average ConRajoy 43 With Pedro Sánchez 2 But this year moreover the debt is going to fall and next year even more By the way it would be good if we were ever told why your Government so indebted to the Spaniards Because the progressive government with its debt has long supported ERTs that have saved millions of jobs helped families bought vaccines increased social benefits rebuilt public services and helped the productive economy However you cut salaries cut benefits cut services cut investments cut everything that moved raised all taxes and owed us As I said the other day yours is a minor economic miracle There 's nowhere to catch him and they come here bragging about his great contribution to this country So ladies and gentlemen of the PP let us not boast and do not come to the tale that Pedro Sanchezabra the gates of hell of debt because hell is you Second horseman of the Apocalypse Look modern democracies I tell you because they are often forgotten have been built on a social contract based on a reasonable division of capital and labour The benefits ownership and freedom of the market were respected and in return a shared solidarity was required with which to maintain public services and with them a welfare state that guaranteed citizens that they were free from the tyranny of necessity And all this through progressive taxation both for income from work and for capital By the way tomorrow forty years of the great socialist victory that launched the Government that began to build in Spain the welfare state Because although the governments of VOX which are already beginning to make scares and look to the sky and some others believe that Franco did so it was the governments of Felipe González who set up the public health system beyond what was the attention of Social Security making millions of people who were not entitled to enter the system and have the right to health in this country those who put compulsory education up to the age of sixteen and by their hand public education in a country with too much illiteracy inheritance of Francoism and a public pension system that included millions of people especially women who had not been able to contribute because they had exploited them Yes this was done by the governments of Felipe González Franco did what he did was imprison banish and shoot those who later made it possible That was Franco and you your heirs But I return to the social contract because it was unilaterally broken by the neoliberal tide that began in the 1980s with Thatcher and Reagan but which had its maximum expression in the previous crisis when they imposed all of our recipes applied the law of the strongest and abandoned millions of people who ended up in the midst of marginalization and poverty But I have bad news for you ladies and gentlemen of the right your neoliberal project failed and today it is the social democratic project that is rebuilding the social contract and yes once again through taxation of progressive taxation You even though you now hide a lot are adamant enemies of taxation They have said that it is the theft of the state that the government is supplying itself with them that money is better in the pocket of the citizens But this whole verb is nothing but a trap You use citizens but what you really think is that money where it is best in your pockets in yours in those of those who already have them full Because for more than 90 of the population taxes are not a theft they are the health of their family the education of their children the pensions of their elderly the care of dependents the safety of their streets the roads on which they travel the trains on which they travel For more than 90 of Spanish and Spanish people taxes are the guarantee of their freedom and the guarantee of equal opportunity for life Yes because taxes for many are their own life because the vast majority know that they could never pay the 200 000 euros that your child 's education costs from the start to the end of a career they know that they could never pay out of their pocket for the operations or care that a disease can provide for them Ladies and gentlemen of the right the vast majority of Spaniards and Spaniards know that their best investment and the best way to secure their future and cope with the adverse moments of their lives is to pay taxes And you are making an absolutely demagogic speech tremendously anti-pedagogic of the real and profound meaning of taxation as a tool to fight against inequality and country builder and moreover demolishing for the system we have built among all I know you do n't care but the vast majority do n't Stop lying The left is not imposing expropriation taxes The fiscal pressure in Spain and you know it is far less than that of the countries in our environment We are far behind those countries that we then want to look like Stop saying that you defend the popular classes when in Andalusia you have forgiven the wealth tax to the great fortunes with one hand and with the other you ask 1 billion others to solve their problems Stop saying that they defend the popular classes when they are against the big companies who yesterday told us that they had increased their profits by 25 or 29 because of the rise of lashipothecas because of the price of energy that is to say because of the crisis and they bring some of those benefits to those who are having a hard time with the crisis when they use as Moreno Bonilla has already announced the tax on the great fortunes because it bothers them that whoever else has to pay more or when he announces a great fall in taxes in the Community of Madrid which dazzles the world he reduces 80 euros to the incomes that earn 20 000 but 580 euros to the people who earn 90 000 in a range of progressiveness By the way it forgets those who earn less than 20 000 to whom the government of Pedro Sánchez does help with the minimum living income with the electric bonds with the law against evictions with unemployment benefits but that from their governments on the right they receive nothing at all I mean as always you help the poor by lowering taxes on the rich That 's what they do But yes when they govern they raise all taxes especially VAT which is the one that most affects the middle and working classes So ladies and gentlemen of the PP do n't say that Pedro Sánchez opens the doors to fiscal hell because the infernofiscal and above all vital are you Third horseman of the Apocalypse Pensions Pensions are not sustainable they must be lowered You 're always looking for a problem instead of ever providing a solution They always go with the discourse of fear of hopelessness of the broken future for the elderly Updating pensions so that they do not lose purchasing power seems an abomination to them and they do not hesitate to confront grandchildren with grandparents which is the exercise of greater irresponsibility never seen in this country But look Spanish Social Security is the best equity tool we have It is the system that guarantees a dignified life in old age and the truly equal system for all Spanish and Spanish wherever they are live where they live and have worked where they have worked Everyone benefits applying the same rules to everyone and we can proudly say that public pensions are the greatest expression of equality and solidarity of all and of all Spaniards of whom they were of whom they are and of whom they will be And this Government is making a huge effort to make them sustainable to clarify and differentiate the expenses and revenues of those who are not He has announced that in two or three years we will achieve the neutrality of the system that is that expenses and revenues have zero deficits and these budgets for the first time in three years put in the Social Security hut EUR 3 billion to go and fill it that hut from which you took the 60 billion that the evil Zapatero had left you That is with progressive governments there will be public pensions that will be revalued with the CPI and with you there will be private pension plans because this will feed the business of one of your own Ask the pensioners of this country who is hell whether Pedro Sánchez who is committed to the sustainability of the public pension system or Mr Feijóo who is neither expected nor expected And fourth rider The economy The Spanish economy is sinking and inflation is going to devour us But does it hurt them so much to recognize that GDP is growing and inflation is falling in Spain as in no other country in Europe Does it bother you so much that Spain is doing well So deep rooted have you that the worse for Spain the better for me We do not ask them to join fervently in the policies that this Government is implementing and that are working We simply ask you since you are so disgusted to display yourself in that condition a little patriotic sensitivity that you do not go out there and say that Spain is a disaster that you do not go to Brussels and ask that you do not give us European funds that if you are going to take a photo do not make it look bad because they do not give you the reason I know that it must be very hard to come up to this rostrum as Mrs Gamarra said yesterday to make a catastrophic speech about the mismanagement that this government is making of European funds and only a few hours later to see how Brussels tells the European PP to stop plotting that Brussels is disbursing money from the funds to Spain because the objectives are being met They do n't give one And I know ladies and gentlemen of the PP that you have it wrong that you have a big problem because you wanted to see in Liz Truss your salvation your great white conservative hope tax cuts no energy savings no energy price controls no Iberian exceptions Finally yours what you have been telling us for so long brought to practice So of course they quickly launched to tell us that to see if we learned that this was to have the feet on the ground and know what was going on Forty five days later the British economy sinks and the risk premium goes off the debt becomes unsustainable the country makes water everywhere and the fifth conservative leader appears on the stage Yeah I know they 're turning her down now It 's like Barcenas that gentleman passing by Liz Truss is that lady who walked into 10 Downing Street Us Liz Truss who is he Mr. Feijoo has never said that there is a need for drastic reductions Now
Our electoral program does not speak of widespread tax cuts Ayuso has never said that Madrid does not turn off and that saving energy is a thread the spokesmen of the PP have never spoken of the timoibérico Now you fucking hemerotheque I do n't think anyone has ever tried to do a stork in such a short time in such a short space and with such little credibility Do n't worry Liz Truss Pablo Married in his day your current leader Mr. Feijóo you yourselves are the anecdote the category is the failure of your recipe Yes ladies and gentlemen of the right your neoliberal catechism has failed because it has been shown that it is unable to sustain economic growth orderly and sustainable without leaving millions of people out of progress and without generating unbearable inequalities When inequality reaches obscene levels and becomes unbearable it breaks societies breaks countries and breaks political systems You far from fighting inequality fed it and continue to feed it They 've failed and now they 're naked They have no choice He 's dropped his model They have no ideas or proposals and as a knockout boxer repeat the mantra of this government 's social communist hell And when they have no choice but to say something their great contribution and their great proposal is to vote against everything that helps people to withdraw everything that budgets are withdrawn the law of abortion and repeal everything we will repeal the law of euthanasia the lawtrans the law of itself is yes and we will resort to the courts everything else I mean his proposals are nothing his alternative is nothing his ideas are nothing nothing that allows us to move forward nothing that allows us to build I 'm done In life and also in politics there are two great mobilizing emotions fear and hope Fear produces resquemor and resquemor hate and hatred seeks guilty and enemies to end sooner or later confrontation and social fracture On the contrary hope encourages collective commitment extends solidarity strengthens coexistence and seeks a shared future I 'm sorry to tell you that you lords of the right as horsemen of the Revelation with your permanent search for enemies are sowers of hatred We prefer to extend and represent hope Eskerrik asko
"Thank you President Lord Great Marlaska do n't be frightened you 've seen me go up to the rostrum and put a scared fugitive face that you do n't know where to run Do n't worry calm down please although I understand that it 's not easy for you as it's the lockdown of Morocco a country for you partner and friend that promises to contain illegal immigration in exchange for a few bizums of millionaire amounts to then leave you totally unprotected and even guilty when the misfortune produces in the area bordering the sea with the Moroccan village of Beni Ensar In other words the tragedy occurs in the fence yes which Morocco has installed by reusing the concertinas that you removed from the fences of Ceuta and Melilla to put its feathers inverted some feathers inverted that by the way so much headache are giving it The area that is close to the so called Chinese neighborhood in Melilla is also an area where there are still no inverted combs its great failure Anyway to what I was going what a small move the Alawite king has made It is what you have to rely on in a country with little scruple and much arrogance which you are not able to stop Because those two thousand immigrants traveled a hundred kilometers to reach first Mount Gurugu and set up their camps there until they waited for the moment of the assault and then headed for the Beni Enzar area adjacent to Melilla And when is the performance of the Moroccan gendarmes taking place to stop that avalanche All these immigrants leave organized at six in the morning from the skirt of Mount Gurugú and from there to the vicinity of the Beni Enzar border there are more than 5 kilometers Could n't the Moroccan Police act there Did you have to wait until they got to Beni Enzar to see dawn on the way at six in the morning In short Morocco is taking the plunge plundering the pocket of Spain and Europe by making the paripé on foot pretending to be a police officer of legal immigration and you are there justifying your policy and your friendship with the Alawite Kingdom Mr Marlaska Spain cannot leave immigration control and the protection of its sovereignty in the hands of a third country let alone a country which has already shown that it is not reliable As much as you and your official statistics regarding immigration flows continue to conceal the actual number of immigrants who entered Ceuta between 17 and 18 May 2021 the reality is that it is and more than twelve thousand illegals entered Ceuta in less than forty eight hours and it was the Moroccan gendarmes who pushed Moroccan subjects to cross Ceuta And at the height of absurdity you leave Morocco control of immigration By the way none of your subsidized media has helped much in this scheme They all published that the tragedy was in the Melilla fence And the NGOs who also profit from public money have not helped him either In fact for example in 2022 the Spanish Refugee Aid Commission received a subsidy from the Ministry of Inclusion Social Security and Migration of € 23750,000 But it is one of those non-governmental organizations that accuses you of using violence to defend our borders In the face of this pressure I imagine that you will have already planned to increase the subsidy a little further in the State General Budgets by 2023 a little wo n't you Mr Marlaska And for your sake those who have sat you on the bench of defendants today to explain are your other partners these partners who are the life insurance of this government to stay in power coups separatists and heirs of ETA You 're surrounded by the best of every house Mr. Marlaska Of course Mr Marlaska that in the VOX Parliamentary Group we regret each and every one of the deaths that occurred on the Moroccan border on 24 June and anyone that occurs in the Mediterranean but Minister it will not be VOX that excuses you because it is your portfolio and this government that implements open door immigration policies that only cause the arrival of massive and disorderly illegal immigration that sows chaos and produces a so called ferocious effect a so called effect that could be observed that same 24 June when all all except your president who did so with delayed effect despite having a caterva of eight hundred advisers of whom four hundred are Presidency we saw the images so lamentable so terrible and so inhumane of the two thousand illegal immigrants who tried to jump the border fence of Beni Ensar with Melilla with more than thirty dead and so many injured But you and I both know that a few days before this avalanche there was a transfer of immigrants from the Melilla CETI to the peninsula and that in these cases it is precisely the NGOs that warn of the low occupation of the CETI making appeals to the mafias and putting into effect what is being translated into tragedy days later You have come to make massive transfers out of the CETI of Melilla up to one hundred and twenty immigrants a day and this only a few months ago in March of this year Wow Mr. Marlaska March just when two attempted assaults on Melilla 's fence also took place in one day Not one but two in March 2022 after you pulled one hundred and twenty immigrants out of CETI They want to give the image that none of the CETI in the cities of Melilla and Ceuta are collapsed producing that so called effect which goes away from their hands with dramas like the one that made him appear today On my last visit to the temporary immigration centre in Ceuta where I asked for information on various aspects concerning the departure of immigrants to the peninsula they assured us that the departures were between ten and twenty illegal per week always keeping the same number of residents In other words every week the same number of illegal immigrants enter the city from CETI in Ceuta to the peninsula I encourage you in your reply if you are going to use it to tell me the exact number of immigrants who have moved from the CETI of Melilla and Ceuta to the peninsula in these years to the head of the Ministry of the Interior it is certainly a very interesting figure And while I wait for your answer here I show a headline El Faro de Melilla March 3 2022 The CETI welcomes 150 migrants after the transfer to the peninsula of 600 in months Congratulations Mr Marlaska you will pass on to history as the minister who never had to the temporary residence centers of saturated immigrants thus contenting NGOs who rarely fulfil the laudable purpose they claim to be defending and who are necessary co-operators of this illegal trafficking in persons thereby enriching the mafias who traffic in human lives both by land and by sea And that Mr. Marlaska I do n't say To a parliamentary question from the VOX Parliamentary Group the Executive provides us with data reflecting a gradual increase year after year in criminal organizations engaged in illegal immigration If we have fourteen criminal organizations dedicated to the trafficking of immigrants accounted for in 2016 we have increased to sixteen in 2017 twenty six in 2018 and thirty in 2020 and we do not have the data of the current number since the statistics have remained in the year of pandemic To date therefore the number of such organizations has doubled as a result of the data they have offered us Congratulations Mr Marlaska congratulations again with you in the Ministry of the Interior the criminal organizations are rubbing their hands literally And congratulations Mr Marlaska you will also pass to history as the Minister of the Interior who produced the effect called voracious and lamentable causing more deaths on both sides of the fence And once I 've congratulated you on being covered in glory in this legislature I 'm going with another aspect We have already said that the deaths occurred on the Moroccan border Therefore the possible violation of human rights denounced by these NGOs and those formations that claim to defend human rights one of which represents in this House ETA 's heirs who took away life the main human right almost a thousand people small is the legitimacy of their denunciation was not on the part of our forces and security forces of the State so they can not be asked for any responsibility That first of all and secondly that 24 June you have acknowledged the facts were perfectly organized and violent Listen our National Police and our Civil Guard in defense of our borders and our sovereignty are in a much smaller number than the assailants They sell anti-disturbing means you leave them in many cases without that material in the vans without effective protective equipment and find themselves with the assault of thousands of armed migrants armed with hooks with hooks with sticks with hooks with shears to cut the wire with bottles full of excrement and even with live lime"
I 'm done Madam President You speak of proportionality The image that their subsidized dicasteries take out is that of the immigrant with bloody cuts never that of an injured agent who in defense of his homeland without the support of his ministry and his Government faces immigrants thousands and each with an arsenal of white weapons Mr. Grande Marlaska allow our civilian guards to defend themselves from these attacks on our homeland with all possible resources material and human resources
Reinforcements so that they can fully protect our borders together with the corresponding legal protection It does not leave them helpless who are protecting from the attack on our homeland Thank you
Thank you very much Mr. Great Marlaska you 've shown that you 're keeping the guy as good as you can with justifications for one another and with lies for another Cheer up you 've got less to run away from But really the only thing I had to tell you about what ministry CETI manages when I told you about immigrant transfers from CETI to the peninsula Do you also want to drain the bulk of those transfers Entering your exhibition I do not know if you have yet to know that we are talking about a matter of defense in the face of the attack of thousands of immigrants to Spain And in the face of those attacks you your Government do not react Well yes by inaction in many cases or by action against in many others I say inaction because it did not give me time in my previous speech to teach you how you defend the border of Melilla in the two assaults that took place in March this year in twenty four hours Onda Tuit Zero Melilla March 3 ten and two minutes in the morning Advance Dozens of sub-Saharan immigrants have managed to access Melilla this morning through the area between the Chinese neighborhood and the Muslim cemetery First tweet from Wave Zero Second tweet by Onda Zero Melilla March 3 ten and twelve minutes in the morning ten minutes apart Nine days of equality begin in the Civil Guard Command Ten minutes difference between one tweet and another will you explain it to me Because this is because in the face of the organized and violent attempt of hundreds of immigrants in March at the Melilla fence you force the Benemerita agents to be on a course on equality while the rest of the troops play their lives on foot without material and without reinforcements Very enlightening of the protection that this Government is doing from our southern border As enlightening as it is that you lie when you talk about reinforcements and the truth ratifies you Mr. Marlaska Interior leaves the squares of 114 civilian guards unreplaced in the fences of Ceuta and Melilla Who do you want to fool Minister Let 's see that entering Spain illegally with violence cannot be a right and the Executive far from admitting the error and implementing a firm immigration policy that seriously protects our borders what it does is allocate public money to feed mafias and NGOs eating that monster from the trade of people fed by the deaths in the ditch and by the sea Human trade will continue as long as this Government does not act firmly As long as they continue to allow the subsidized proliferation of NGOs they will continue to defeat the mafias and as long as that happens they will continue to obtain barbarism Minister with those deaths of immigrants who come to Spain invited by their executive deceived under the promise of a better life and you will continue to obtain barbarism too in those neighborhoods In short chaos everywhere Mr. Marlaska And when he continues to leave our civilian guards on the border and when the Ministry of the Interior has published the vacancies at the national level and we see and see the agents that to top it off he does not take out a single vacancy for the protection and surveillance units of the border perimeter and therefore again acts out of inaction because you bet not to increase the staff of the Benemerita to defend our homeland from violent attacks Faced with this we can only come to a conclusion you this government are an accomplice to the mafia of human trafficking and you can now put all the anti-trepa meshes you want and all the inverted feathers you want that the problem is not the design or shape of the fence because the immigrant who wants to enter illegally is going to make the weapon necessary to stand up and jump Therefore the problem is your open door policy the problem is the so called effect induced by those policies the problem is the subsidies to NGOs increasingly numerous and in increasing quantity for such unhumane purposes as you have shown here today you trying to justify the unjustifiable The problem is their lack of readiness to strengthen our state security forces and bodies at the southern border The problem Mr. Marlaska is you The problem Mr Marlaska is your Government which so wretchedly protects our homeland from the invasions that are being suffered by land and sea
I 'm done Mr. President Mr Marlaska take care of what the Spaniards want and expect me to make a Government of Spain to ensure our territorial integrity and national sovereignty
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The citizen parliamentary group brings us with it a motion for the Government to define as a matter of urgency a plan for the rebalancing of public accounts that will put an end to the structural deficit and thus achieve the objectives of budgetary stability The truth is that we must praise the citizen parliamentary group for the opportunity of the measure but not for the indolence of this House okay not for the indolence of this House because it seems that this issue of budgetary balance only concerns those who are more focused on prose than on poetry Among those who are very focused on prose we have the Governor of the Banco de España who since the beginning of this parliamentary term in all his appearances in the Committee on Economic Affairs and in the Committee on Budgets has asked us for this pact or this intervention to lead us to a fiscal consolidation agreement In the same sense the AIReF has also urged us Do n't say it 's not the time now Is n't now the time What the governor told us is that it is time to do so regardless of whether the effects can be deployed at a later time Or are you going to make the plan when the house is falling on us In any case I have appointed the Banco de España and the AIReF which are two independent bodies whose independence this House should respect I 'll talk to you about the numbers Look at you let 's take perspective From December 2007 to September 2021 almost fourteen years the gross domestic product has grown only by 100 billion euros alone It 's grown by 9.2 Public debt has grown by 1 billion 47 billion ten times more in absolute terms But I will also say this in relative terms GDP has grown in these fourteen years by 9 public debt has grown by 272 And this is only the Socialist Party 's fault because in those fourteen years we have the Rajoy sexenium included which produced 40 of that 1 billion 47 billion public debt You guys talk about the guys You guys are so lost the guys are already up The rates at the close of 2020 closed by 0.016 if I take the 10 year bond as reference closed by 2021 by 0.395 the last auction was closed by 0.753 this morning it quoted 1.30 as 10 years The whole curve was in 2020 up to ten years in negative rates We 've been with positive guys since we were two years old Okay I mean the low end policy is over But what will this generate They still do not believe that interest expenditure growth has not been noticed The growth in interest expenditure over these fourteen years has doubled we have gone from paying 16 billion to paying 32 billion and if the rates we have today remain fixed in less than eight years we will pay 50 billion Look this waste of interest on account of debt policies has caused us to increase from 16 000 to 32 billion Yesterday The Economist said Think what you want in the short term you will climb something more than you are thinking and in the long less If this were to be maintained we would be leaving at 50 billion in a very short time Look the defence of the welfare state and the defence of the state require balanced public accounts The State in order to fulfil its basic functions security defence justice requires balanced accounts The welfare state in order to deploy quality public services requires balanced accounts This lack of budgetary stability to what leads us or has already led us to the failure of the State to fulfil its basic functions and to a low quality of the public services it provides We have told you many times we have come to save the State and the State from the welfare of you from your tax voraciousness and from your waste I hope that Mr Edmundo Bal does n't give him much of a shame that we 're going to vote with Citizens because really since he 's joined the exalted centrism he needs a rebalancing or at least a parallel it's you Thank you so much
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen We come back here with the issue of taxing banking and energy for extraordinary profits now adorned with the tax on big fortunes It is interesting what Mr Bel has told you check where there have been more benefits than in banking and energy He did not want to give them ideas but Mr. Mazon did give them one the pharmaceuticals and I will give them another the funeral homes Funeral homes have made a lot of money during the crisis Mr Baldoví if you want to be Basque and Navarro it is easier make yourself Spanish a nation of equal people regardless of the territory You 'll have it a lot more solved and so you do n't have to go around so much Mr. Regó the 60 billion did n't go to the bank they went to the boxes Mr Margall indeed the cuts were in 2010 but it is that Mr Rajoy did not win the elections until November 20 2011 and entered the government on December 21 2011 and still Mr Rajoy 's powers were not retroactive And then for those who define the poor as the two lowest income deciles and complain there have been those who complained here that it is always 20 of course 2 for 10 always gives 20 If you define the poor as the two lowest deciles it will always be 20 whatever this government does and whoever comes It 's not worth much but I 'm going to stop at the three big groups of problems that this rule has The first the procedures We are called on 10 November to the Bureau and the Board of Spokesmen for the 15th meeting to allow the text to proceed On the 11th day the next day we are also quoted not anymore to the Bureau and the Board of Spokespersons but to the Board of Spokespersons so that half an hour after the Bureau and the Board of Spokespersons we constitute the Board of Spokespersons It is approved that the Commission will meet in 48 hours but we will not be given the text In forty eight hours the vetoes of the Government are accepted which the next day the Government raises what it wants me to say and on the 17th everything is approved and today we are already discussing it So these were the rushes and the urgent procedure has turned you into express This was a first group Second group then there are constitutional problems as you know It does not seem reasonable to introduce this tax on big fortunes as an amendment to the first tax text or to assume that the new figure of the tax on big fortunes is not redundant with the property tax or to turn the tax or rather the tax it is actually a tax although you have called it a tax to energy and banking on income and not on profits as we have told you I have told him and some of those who have preceded me in speaking have told him Thirdly there are the economic problems in the text Without being exhaustive first you seek to tax the extraordinary profits but you tax the revenues and the financial margin and you do not allow deducting the expenses necessary to obtain them and second you are penalizing the investment in Spain both banking and energy They do not take into account the timing of the economic cycle as the European Central Bank has warned them They do not take into account cost translation problems If you 're blinding one route of cost translation maybe we 'll find another I have already warned in this plenary when Citizens tabled an amendment to the whole and this may happen to move to the workers That is true I think you are bringing an amendment to raise the minimum level of the tax on big fortunes from 3 to 3.7 million I imagine because there is someone in the Council of Ministers who is on that stage But none of this nothing nothing none of this is important absolutely nothing the important is something else It gives you absolutely the same thing whether these taxes can be applied or not it gives you absolutely the same thing given the legal inconsistencies and indeterminateness of which the text is plagued It gives you the same thing that this tax can become unconstitutional It gives you absolutely the same thing to have to return the amounts previously entered with your corresponding interest of delay You are given absolutely the same economic consequences of the tax because of course to say that we take 3 billion to these pretendedly rich and left to the state which must be another purportedly poor that we give them to the state look you do not evaluate that taxes are not only that taxes have a series of economic consequences and you may be destroying more wealth than that which you transfer from the pocket of those taxed to the state They have n't considered it either If you want to end poverty the best way to end it is to create wealth By distributing doing misery which is what you are in you do not live better In any case what 's true is that you spend less envy that 's how it is And now I will tell you what is important that it is not the three groups of problems that I have told you the constitutionals the procedurals the economics no no the important thing is that you want to say tomorrow we put a tax on big capital and the rich and the opposition did not support it That 's what you want to say tomorrow and it gives you the same thing as the courts will take him down in a few years If they kill him what will they say that judges are macho Or if for example those same judges kill him but while you are in the opposition will you say that the government is fascist And you have n't done it wrong I do n't know if you 're betting or just in a hurry and what you 're looking for is having a complaint by tomorrow because you love having complaints The totalitarian governments are characterized because they never admit the error it is always a matter of others of international capitalism of the Jews the economic elites the judges the masonry the masters who smoke pure the stage of Real Madrid the heteropatriarchy elneoliberalism centralism the Church There are so many enemies lurking under his bed Look at you the enemy is in his head Thank you very much
Thank you very much President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Madam First Vice President of the Government and Minister for Economic Affairs We will discuss the Business Creation and Growth Bill The truth is that you who are so fond of propaganda in the end you have appropriated it in the expression Create and Growing Law that the same applies to what concerns us at this time as to a law of birth promotion A law with which I imagine you will try if approved to transmit to the population that practically from tomorrow Spain is Silicon Valley and nothing is further from reality The law they propose is a collage of reforms You in a text amend eleven laws and a real legislative decree and what you do in the background is change fifty eight rules between articles and provisions and by the way create a couple of observatories which never come wrong for friends In order to promote the business climate Minister legal and economic security is important and its latest actions in Indra through SEPI and its lack of respect for the goodness of statistical information do not go in that direction We 'll see if this affects us among investors Then there 's the language You always use corrupt language They talk about entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship because they find it difficult to use the word enterprise and entrepreneur It is not the same as an entrepreneur as an entrepreneur because what we need is not people with initiatives only that that is an entrepreneur we need an entrepreneur that is an entrepreneur who also risks his assets As I have told you it is practically a law of cuts where you update corporate commercial financial and register aspects In the end which has been the most important they have made a constitutional fit of the problem that we had with the law of market unity and that is why they will get the support of the independence groups They present as a star measure the possibility of creating a company with 1 euro and they miss what is important The minimum social capital in an economic non-legal sense is not 3000 euros or raise them it is the minimum investment that the entrepreneur needs to make It is true that the law requires it to be 3000 if it wants the form of society The entrepreneur could already perfectly make that minimum investment below 3000 what happens is that then he could not have the corporate form And why did he take the corporate form For two reasons that we totally forget One to delineate his patrimonial responsibility that is so that his personal and family heritage would not be affected by society This could have been achieved by allowing individual entrepreneurs a delimitation of their professional assets that was the limit of what they could lose if they failed And the second reason why you were doing it you know was because of a tax problem because there is a strong tax arbitration between declaring income tax when you have an economic activity by natural persons that by corporations Basically what you do n't solve is a problem that Bertrand de Jouvenel warned us about in The Ethics of Redistribution in 1951 You are asking the individual entrepreneur when it would not be necessary to do so it would be much better if you allowed the individual entrepreneur to be an individual entrepreneur On the other hand you say that you eliminate the 3000 euro requirement but it is not true because you put an implicit endorsement in the members rule to society The other issue is lateness Morosity is not solved by creating observatories I understand that someone will put you there but no Neither with sanctions nor putting problems to public procurement for those who have some outstanding obligation really it is solved with incentives and we have proposed many incentives during this legislature The universal application of the cash criterion for the settlement of income company and VAT taxes It only pays taxes what is charged and only deducts what is paid Public morals do n't even treat it He 's been told several times and even his partners have put it in his face Public lateness seems to exist but you might well if the state of the art permits create a single taxpayer account for which we could charge against any debtor balance of an Administration the obligations we had regardless of which adversary was That would indeed be a country project for the Reconstruction Transformation and Resilience Plan yes sir to create a system of multilateral compensation for all taxpayers against all public institutions For the umpteenth time they promote the unique windows Well what are we going to tell you but let 's hope the e-government works Minister because it 's not working Market unity requires value to believe in Spain as a project You have a very large part in this House that does not believe in the unity of Spain as a project and therefore it is impossible for that to work Business financing requires less mistrust of those who ask for money and then there is the bureaucracy The bureaucracy which you some have told you have failed to solve reduces the productivity of our companies lowers wages and generates part of the inflation differential that Spain has Some of the inflation is of monetary origin the fault of the European Central Bank and another we are not going to deny it is due to external events but another part is purely of this government and of the previous governments because of the many obstacles that Spanish companies have to operate You are the last you lose everything and you are also the last in employment which was the only thing you lacked unlike Nadal you are really your reverse and as you are demonstrating with your last maneuvers you have very wrong to lose What Spain needs I conclude president is that the government respects the law and interferes less in the activities that requires less taxes and social burdens that liquidates the taxes according to the current of charges and payments that eliminates tax arbitration between natural and legal persons and limits the property responsibility of individual entrepreneurs
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I would also like to say good afternoon to the Minister because I believe that in the debate on a bill of this importance it should be We have come to debate and probably to approve because you have seen the good climate in the Committee on the Economy always and with this rule there has been in a very special way the draft of a new law on the securities market which would be the third in the history of Spain The first of 1988 has provided very good services to society to the nation and has arrived here in some way because as you know it is part of the current one which is a consolidated text the Royal Legislative Decree 4/2015 The text we are proposing now as Mr Capdevila has reminded us involves the transposition into Spanish law of five directives from the European Parliament and the Council The last in fact was approved on the 14th so we have not only been up to date with the delays that we were having but we have moved forward I do not know if from the right to the European Union In addition as stated in the explanatory statement of the project which is now being put to the vote a number of subjects have been identified that required updating and modernisation with the aim of improving the competitiveness and attractiveness of Spanish securities markets enhancing their entrepreneurial financing capacity always with the maximum guarantees for the investor This means moreover that the law will no longer be the Securities Market Act to receive a new name it will be the law of the securities market and investment services I do n't intend to bore you with the content The law is very prolific has ten titles 367 articles and 27 provisions of various kinds However I would like to draw your attention to the fundamental mission of a financial system because this law together with the Law on the Ordination Supervision and Solvency of Credit Entities 10/2014 and the Law on the Ordination Supervision and Solvency of Insurance Entities 20/2015 constitute the basic regulation of a financial system The fundamental mission of a financial system is to capture the surplus of so called surplus economic units usually mature families to apply it in favour of deficit economic units usually young families and businesses and for a few decades the Administration This process of fund raising and implementation requires intensive work by financial intermediaries and has two purposes One on the one hand is to adapt the risk and term preferences of the savers to the investor 's financing demands because they are often opposed preferences which is known as the process of financial transformation and on the other hand to increase as much as possible the flow of savings aimed at productive investment which is called the process of financial maximization and all this to achieve the greatest and most efficient allocation of resources available to an economy in this case the Spanish one In this sense the draft law that we are debating today together with the regulation that I spoke about before the banking and insurance institutions constitutes a very good regulation of the Spanish financial system I dare say However I wanted to warn you of the risks that exist so that good regulation does not achieve the desired objectives which are two First legal uncertainty and then the application of savings to consumptive expenditure Ladies and gentlemen the legal uncertainty in Spain does not derive so much from the actions of our courts they work reasonably well not even from the excessive regulation and intervention of many authorities that interfere in business decision making processes Nor do I talk to them about the legal uncertainty of changing regulations I speak to you of the lack of respect for the law with capital letters and of the legal uncertainty generated by a State in a situation of constant questioning as if a teenager in vocational crisis were being treated although after the forty it is difficult to understand this type of behavior The application of savings to the financing merely of the expenditure that others cannot meet today does not lay the basis for any growth or I am afraid that of the recovery of the borrowed capital at least in terms of the capacity of the purchasing power i.e. discounted inflation It makes no sense gentlemen for savers to give up current consumption if they are not assured within what is insurable when we talk about the future of a real increase in their future consumption And it cannot ensure such a real increase if capital is not largely devoted to productive investment i.e. if an efficient allocation of resources is not made And public debt is not much less a productive investment except in some very small cases In the last five years the financing capacity of families and in part of businesses has been in spite of everything frankly high The Spanish have saved almost 200,000 million euros which have not been enough to finance the nearly 300,000 that public administrations have needed That is why we have needed another 200,000 from the European Central Bank to meet that deficit of financing for public debt and to reduce our international financial position This is a good law for regulating securities markets and investment services which together with the laws on the management supervision and solvency of credit institutions and insurers assure us a good financial system However ladies and gentlemen you have to be careful because high end vehicles do not work well in the desert they serve no purpose Arrived here I wish you happy holidays at which we celebrate Christmas the birth of the Redeemer the only one who can redeem us I wish you the best in the year 2023 in all respects except the election and thank you very much"
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I was already surprised that we are not basically dedicated to lying which is what the left has dedicated itself to What did you say That he rescued himself at the bank But listen all that Sareb bought were seven savings fruit boxes from the merger in turn of savings boxes a subsidiary bank of a savings bank and a very small Galician bank nothing more Not a single asset was purchased from an anonymous partnership like depository only from those that had the form of foundation savings banks run by all of you Mrs. Garrido it 's not la FROB it 's the Sareb but it 's the FROB Neither is Luis Guindos but is Luis de Guindos And I 've been surprised by some things For example Mr Matute has told us One day we will have to make the hard heads of some understand that public intervention in the economy is necessary Mr Matute I see you are not in the room I do not know how you intend to make my hard headed understanding that public intervention in the economy I see that you are sorry is necessary I do n't know how you intend to do it I hope it 's not with the methods we 're used to That being said we do not dispute that the Sareb is public we have always said so I said in December 2012 that the Sareb was public regardless of the financial engineering operation that Mr. De Guindos had designed so that it would not compute as public debt and deficit In the end the European Union ended up giving reason to the treaty makers that we maintained that position That is why Mr Martínez Oblanca although I fully agree with you in what you have said to this bench which forgets the disaster in which you left the numbers to this other one what is true is that Mr De Guindos tried to deceive the Spaniards with a financial engineering operation so that he will not compute as public debt all the indebtedness of the Sareb On the other hand there seems to be something completely unnoticed here that you Mrs Garrido have put in your explanatory statement which is that the Sareb bought the assets at an overprice of EUR 18 billion He paid 18 billion euros more and so it was impossible for the accounts to fit that great manager who is Mr. De Guindos How are you going to get a 15 return by paying 18 billion more than the assets are worth That 's completely impossible You have n't said anything but I think there 's a lot to investigate Let 's keep going Our position is that we do not share the political control to which they want to subject the assets of the Sareb because in the background it is to affect more of the same As I have told you many times before the Sareb is but a century that served to sustain the prices so that the bank that is would not be dragged away by a fall in its assets Here the bank was not saved as you have said the Deposit Guarantee Fund was basically saved which had collected deposit insurance premiums and had no money to deal with the commitment it had as a public institution vis -à vis depositors We believe in the principle of subsidiarity We do not believe at all that the state has to provide us with everything We understand that the State is the guarantor but not the provider For example in food and clothing sectors to which you attack a great deal we are phenomenally crowded without the intervention of the State Do you understand The same applies to telephone and consumer electronics and it could be with many more things if they abandoned their ideological mantras By the way the principle of subsidiarity is not a fad it is in the Maastricht Treaty Of course they already understand that we are going to oppose this because indeed Mr Matute we do not have so much interventionism in our heads Look at the disaster that Sareb has brought us By the way if I had bought at the prices I had to buy according to the European Union it would have benefits right now That is much of the guilt comes from the design of the operation that was originally made The extension of the functions of the State beyond those of their own leads us only to economic collapse and of the entire productive system You continue to insist that we are going phenomenal but we spend our lives boasting of increased care spending
The expansion of the welfare state is but a sign of the impoverishment and alienation of the population to which you therefore lead interventionism Thank you very much
"Thank you so much Good morning ladies and gentlemen Good morning Madam First Vice President of the Government and Minister of Economy We came to discuss the validation of Royal Decree 1/2022 which by its title should simply reform some aspects of Sareb and FROB In fact it is the only thing the minister has told us about which has forgotten that not only Law 9/2012 Law 11/2015 and Royal Decree 1559 2012 are being amended but also the Royal Decree Law 32/2021 which we were validating this morning and Law 1/2004 are being amended It is to say apart from the reforms on the Sareb and the FROB a series of minor reforms are made in this usual technique to which we are accustomed by the Government the commercial hours of the areas of great tourist influx the Statute of the Workers and the regime of the workers in the service of the public sector are touched This legislative technique with the House and the citizenry generates a kind of tragala like that to which we attended before yesterday if you vote against the obligation to use masks you are voting against the updating of pensions by correction of the deviation So we might as well sing minister as in Mary Poppins that of With a little sugar that pill they give you the pill they give you it will go better if there is a little You who already know her can continue her But I am going to focus on the two main points which are the reform of the FROB and the Sareb apart from the doubts that generate us the definition that make of the participations of the FROB as outside the heritage of the public administrations This does not concern the left that the participations of the FROB are outside the heritage of the public administrations it is true that it is when it is done within a process of resolution but we are concerned we are especially concerned because the participation of the FROB in La Caixa through BCA has not been acquired in a process of resolution but by exchange What are we worried about We are concerned about the two major points I am going to deal with which are the taking of share ownership over 50 which as you know was banned to date and the transfer of real estate assets to non-profit making entities I 'm not going to insist on the figures The minister explained them to us very well What did he tell us Eurostat told us that this counted as deficit as debt debt was increased according to the excessive deficit protocol by 34 billion but it also told us something more The financial engineering operation designed by Mr De Guindos at the end of 2012 it is true that he had just taken the disaster that you the Socialist Party gentlemen left behind a disaster all he was trying to do was avoid the computability of Sareb 's public debt and what Eurostat has told him is that this is public debt And this could not be known Did n't you know Well look this took me by surprise You will forgive the immodestness that is self citing In December 2012 the newspaper El Economista gave me a column to talk about this issue in December 2012 and I said that an analysis beyond the formal aspects of the operation showed that it was public debt In the end it 's what it 's turned out to be Eurostat 's decision does not force the majority of share capital to be taken it does not force regardless of the commercial problems generated by a company with a capital deficit which many have long been solved in the regulation of the Sareb What the government has done from my point of view in this case with good judgment has been once it has lifted the veil of falsehood in which we have lived all this time Minister to make an offer to 54.1 of the capital at least less than 200 euros last week About the price we 're not gonna say anything The Sareb is broken and nothing 's good It has a capital deficit of 9200 million and it has to be assumed by the State but it does not have to be assumed by the State because we are talking about a private sector as you say but because it endorsed the bonds The bonds issued by the Sareb were what the Sareb handed over to the seven savings banks to a subsidiary bank of a savings bank plus a very small private bank as a counterpart to the assets that were handed over to it and endorsed it at the same time I mean we can't now get our hands on our heads Mrs. Calviño In this case it is not because of ignorance but because of lack of intellectual honesty You can't say you 're saving the private sector because this was public from the beginning If it was known that after the 48 billion of capital was consumed everything that was lost had to be put by the state because it was a guarantor a guarantor since December 2012 It has cost us with data on 30 June 2021 14,092 million of which 11,495 are absorbed by the public sector because it loses all its participation and loses 9200 million of the capital deficit while private shareholders lose 2597 Was this predictable I already told you This was nothing more than a silo a silo where assets bought from the beginning over their reasonable value on the one hand to prevent the rescued entities which were basically savings banks these seven come from mergers in turn from savings banks from recording more losses than they had already published and on the other hand to sustain the prices of the real estate sector with that long term sales policy It is not reasonable that having received 51 billion assets and sold only 20 000 in the first eight and a half years data as at 30 June 2021 14 billion losses have been reaped and that with the high market since the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014 which shows that this is not a problem of mismanagement but of operation forgive me the expression Minister misguided misguided I would n't have liked to have been given this responsibility This rather than a silo has been a sine qua non to hide the painful management of PP and PSOE with the help of United Left unions and business associations of savings banks entities with more social perspective than the exclusive digitalism that you are promoting And now they complain that there is part of the population that does not have access to basic financial services I will conclude Madam President We are also concerned I said at the beginning about the transfer of real estate to non-profit entities because it seems that you pretend that every chiringuito"
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen We have come to discuss a proposal by Citizens to correct the harmful effects of the progressive tax in combination with inflation on workers disposable income It is indeed the progressiveness of the tax that generates this harmful effect If the tax were proportional to income the loss of purchasing power entailed by inflation would be the same for the taxpayer as for the public finance However because of this progressiveness the taxpayer 's loss of disposable income is greater than that of the Treasury Rather what is happening because of this progressiveness is that tax revenues increase more than proportionally to inflation while taxpayers tax free revenues increase less As economists say inflation is a tax and an undercover tax In the VOX Parliamentary Group we have always been very concerned about the disposable income of workers and therefore we have tabled an amendment proposing the reduction of social contributions both the bad calls of the employer and those of the worker We say the employer 's bad calls because all of them are actually paid by the worker and by a non-transparent mechanism we avoid the worker knowing that 30 of his effort before paying IRPF VAT special taxes IBI and any other tax that may occur to you has already blown him off the payroll Furthermore we believe that this reduction in social contributions which would at first generate a reduction in public income would be more than offset by the lower need for assistance to the population since there would be an increase in employment But let 's talk about the government executioner because until a few weeks ago the discussion was whether inflation was temporary or permanent but the war that Russia has generated in Ukraine supported by its Bolivian Nicaraguan Venezuelan and Cuban collaborators is generating that the government is putting the blindfold before the wound and is trying to convince us that the bad economic executioner we are accustomed to is always because of external causes In the case of COVID 19 in which you have insisted a lot it has not been so You have a worse economic execution than the rest of the countries In particular you have 267,000 infected per million compared to 57 000 which is the world average you have 2147 dead per million compared to 773 what is the world average and you have the worst economic executioner in the European Union In fact before the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine it was warned that this was the only nation of the 27 that are part of the EU that by the end of 2022 would not have recovered the GDP of 2019 Therefore and remembering what the newspaper El Mundo told us yesterday I textually read to you the headline of the article War is no pretext for incompetence and COVID 19 has been I add Inflation before the outbreak of the Russian war against Ukraine was already 1.7 percentage points higher than the EU average Yesterday the Institute for Economic Studies stated that Spain I quote you textually could reduce its public spending by 14 and continue to offer the same level of public services if it could improve its efficiency to levels similar to those of the OECD average In other words this would save resources of around EUR 60 billion See if we could help the ELA the Francisco Luzón Foundation which has contributed so much to the visibility of this problem if we could reduce that 60 billion In April 2019 in our economic program we proposed a cut of 24 billion in superfluous public spending and you did nothing but throw improvisations at us Now it seems the cut is 60,000 I do not think we were short rather I think that waste has increased over the past three years and as you are the true liberals of this House in the sense that gives you the primary meaning of the dictionary of the Royal Academy you have done nothing but increase spending The latest events have caught us again in the most absolute foresight Three weeks ago we discussed the possibility of starting structural reforms You said he did n't come to the story because it 's never the time for him to live in improvisation and occurrence No gentlemen the worst relative situation in Spain the last of the countries of the European Union in the economic execution and the worst in health matters can only be due to the Spanish differential fact a radical left government supported by the enemies of its unity because there is no good wind for those who do not know where it is going Thank you very much"
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen This is the third year that I come here to discuss title V and section 6 with which this is almost becoming for me on the day of the marmot really I am telling you this because I do not think there have been any Members in this House who have been more aware of the risks of public debt to the House and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs The debt has not stopped growing in absolute terms at the end of September we were at EUR 1.5 billion since December 2020 it has grown by EUR 160 billion at September this year we were at EUR 77 billion when 66 billion had been budgeted for this year and for next year you have budgeted a growth of EUR 67.5 billion You are shielded for example from the fact that GDP has fallen slightly in recent months but you will also prevent us from increasing GDP in nominal terms because of inflation In any case what you are obviating is that the relevant thing is the growth of the interest expense item which had not grown for ten years and that this year 2023 is going to grow for the first time Why has there been ten years without increasing the interest rate in spite of growing volumes of public debt For basically because the rates have been falling but this has come to an end we have already warned this two years ago and since the minimums of March this year the average rate of outstanding debt has done nothing but grow and this year 2023 we are going to pay at last more than the previous year in particular 31 billion 11 billion more which means that each family will have to devote 2000 euros of its income to the payment of interest on the part of the debt that is attributable to it which is 90,000 euros per family But do you know the worst The worst is that as the policy of low rates has ended as we warned you two years ago and as all debt issued at high rates has practically expired in the year 2022 there is a little bit left which will win at the beginning of 2023 from 2024 all debt renewals will be carried out at higher rates than the types to which it was issued What does this mean That we 're going to get into a spiral of rising financial expenditures that 's going to make public accounts unbearable You guys did n't give a shit about the volume They said What gives me half a billion at 2 more than a billion at 1 Sure it 's the same thing at first How long Until the guys start going up because when the guys start going up double duty costs twice as much and that 's what 's going to happen to us And the rates have risen a lot they have risen by 1.5 in the very short stretch by 2.5 in the short stretch and by 3 which is the most relevant in the long term Indeed it is surprising to hear Mrs Muñoz of Podemos remind us of something that is true that of the 1 100 billion increase in public debt that has occurred in the last eighteen years 450 billion are due to the People 's Party which in its seven years proved to be the government that was in debt more quickly That is true but you have the reversed roles because in 2010 the government that cut the salaries of public employees froze the pensions and had a general strike was the socialist government Look the growth in interest expenditure in the coming years if the current rates are maintained is going to lead us to an annual financial expenditure of the order of 40,000 to 45 billion when right now we are paying 31 billion Imagine what a growth of between 10,000 and 15,000 million is dedicated only to interests and which will have to be drawn from other items That is it will be impossible to maintain policies You see low interest monetary policy has turned you into genuine public deficit junkies Why are they going to control him Why are they going to make structural reforms which are always laborious and unpopular in the short term At the beginning of this legislature the governor of the Banco de España not the president the Banco de España has no president has a governor told us about the five year lost by not carrying out structural reforms We have n't lost a quinquennium gentlemen we 've lost four I repeat four quinquenniums we 've lost In the last eighteen years public debt has grown by 285 of nominal GDP nominal GDP per capita has increased by 33 and accumulated inflation by 35 In other words Spanish people in the last 20 years have lost a 2 per capita income That is the success of the policies that the two parties have led You have no interest none in solving the problem All they ask of the European Central Bank is to lower interest rates using as shields the Spanish to those who have led to this situation You will begin to feel in the public accounts the same way that the Spaniards are feeling in their private accounts the increase in the financial burden will make you unbearable to sustain the welfare state The present austerity is the best guarantee of the future of the welfare state And do n't tell me that there was austerity in the governments of the People 's Party when you yourselves gentlemen of the United Left have recognised 450 billion in debt in seven years of which only 60 000 have dedicated themselves to the bailout cajarioja You will continue in your mistakes the mistakes that have impoverished Spain and make it poorer in the future Thank you very much"
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen We live in the times of euphemism We call voluntary termination of pregnancy to abortion or sex reassignment surgery to body mutilation It could therefore not be that we were different in the tax field Thus for example the text for which Citizens present today an amendment to the whole and which presents the two groups defending the Government tells us about a non-taxary public property benefit that is a tax It is a tax for banking and energy companies which are two economic activities as you know very unpopular for two reasons one because they are necessary and no one complains about the price of the unnecessary complains about the price of the necessary and two for the strong mating they have with political power That is why they are so unpopular but in sin these two activities carry penance for their continued support of the 2030 Agenda without respect neither its shareholders nor its customers
But we are better at the text of the proposal than that of the amendment which is correct in many cases This is about extraordinary benefits You see that the simple increase in income is going to generate in these two sectors logically a higher tax share that is the growth of profits is already taxed But let 's go further By the very structure of the profit and loss accounts where fixed costs are deductible the increase in income or the financial margin in the bank will generate a more than proportional increase in results So it 's already recorded In any case all of this as the Lady of Citizens has rightly said I bring here looking at my notes is a real tax dip The situation can be given that in the years 2023 and 2024 the results of the sectors concerned fell however they would pay for the new tax because the new tax does not turn on the results it turns on the revenues I 'm telling Mrs. Vehi to confuse profits with income No no no On the other hand they seem to be very low taxes They say 1.2 or 4.8 Hey one case income and one case financial margin This is equivalent to increasing the tax rate by 12 percentage points In other words a 20 increase in the profits of banking and energy institutions would be fully absorbed by the new tax You talk about extraordinary benefits but no one has bothered to define it In any case Citizens gives us a chance The extraordinary benefit in ordinary activities does not exist if you do not review the international financial reporting standards which do not speak of extraordinary benefit In any case there are non-recurring results due to disinvestment but that is not what they charge They 're talking about the temporality of the tax We were afraid of him Mr Rego and Mr Margall have asked that it be more years that it be permanent We already have experience it was told to our spokesman a few days ago with the income tax that the Americans put in the late 19th or ourselves which we carry with the property tax which is extraordinary also since the beginning of the transition But you only tax the financial margins of the bank and the increase in revenues of activities in Spain What do you expect me to generate this Logically it will generate a lack of investment in Spain since the activities in Spain become much less interesting for the investor Lack of investment in energy can be of concern They are that the increase in costs does not move to the companies I do n't know how they intend to do it First it is to put in the National Securities Market Commission and the Bank of Spain some functions that are inappropriate to them especially in a system of price freedom but it is that you make it obvious that any increase in costs is transferred through the vericouetos of the price system to you do not know who Therefore if you say that you cannot transfer it to the customers you better transfer it to the workers you leave them in a worse situation in your collective bargaining Do you intend to set all the ad hoc prices that banks and electrics purchase in all their inputs I do n't recommend it It would be the solution Since they can't transfer it to the customers and they wo n't want it to be transferred to the workers they 'll have to fix everything This is nothing more than an interventionist measure that will create more problems than the ones it seeks to solve At five and ten o'clock this afternoon we received the report from the European Central Bank which you the Socialist Party wanted it not to arrive The European Central Bank report says some very interesting things about this tax First it does not take into account the whole economic cycle that is it does not take into account that the increase in rates will lead to an increase in late payment On the other hand it says that it is not proportional to the entity 's profitability Which I explained to you before that the first 20 growth points you eat enteritos It does not reflect the costs discussed today as required by the European Banking Authority 's guidelines Finally there is much doubt on the part of the European Central Bank as to what the Bank of Spain is doing about price control The Governor of the Banco de España in the Committee on Budgets has already told us In fact rate increases have cost you at the close of the first half of this year EUR 5 billion to the bank because you are dedicated to looking at the profit and loss account but you never monitor the state of changes in the net worth In any case you know that we have not come here to discuss this whether or not we need to require some taxpayers to make an additional effort at this time of economic crisis caused by the European Union 's energy and monetary policies aggravated in the Spanish case by the inefficiency of this government You 've come to something else You have come to have a seclusion of the opposition as many times dividing the nation Today you have touched two friends of yours banking and electrics and you will dictate that it is the enemy of the people who support you after having supported you so many times and so much on them
As the great Nicholas Gómez Dávila said sponsoring the poor has always been the safest way to get rich in politics Thank you very much
Thank you President Does Castilla wait sleep or dream The poet wonders Castile and Leon have awakened Since last Sunday the Castilanoleonese are bearers of a new hope Thanks to all those who voted for us you are brave ones we are not going to disappoint These days we talked with Mario who gets up every morning at five o'clock to milk his goats and make an exquisite artisan cheese with Libi who tells that thirty years ago there were three teachers in his village that now there is no school and that the two remaining children have to go to a village that is 20 kilometers away taken by their parents because there is no school transport either We have also spoken to farmers farmers traders workers from the few remaining factories who remain as they can and who see how their descendants do not continue what they have built with so much effort for a lifetime They and so many others are the ones who mark the change of course that we want to implement in politics and that can be valued in the motion that we are presenting today We are congratulated because the ballot boxes have shown that beyond political calculations sterile chatter and media violence a new course for Spain is possible This crystallizes in the motion that we present today a battery of measures that must be applied simultaneously with professionalism decision and creativity First in order to succeed in the fight against depopulation and to meet the demographic emergency situation that we live in we have half of the children we need for generational replacement we must renounce the postulates of the 2030 Agenda radically incompatible with the promotion of the family and the defence of the true interests of the Spaniards and their sovereignty and that indoctrines our children by confronting men and women parents against children intoxicating and incapacitating for a healthy family life This is evidenced by the fact that in all the documentation on the demographic challenge that the Government has produced there are no words such as father mother family or birth anywhere How then is a country repopulated Will he be with parents with mothers with family betting on birth and promoting the family the great absentee of his expensive twenty two ministries Ladies and gentlemen Spanish women want to have children The INE gives us a bloody figure more than 70 of Spanish women want to have more than two children and the national average is 1.2 children Why does the Government not address this very serious issue which affects something inherent in the status of women which is the illusion of being a mother It is that the People 's Party and the PSOE which have alternated in the government in recent decades instead of addressing the problem of root depopulation have managed to make rural abandonment in Spain more serious and destructive than in the countries of the environment It is that not only have they abandoned the family and the birth policies but to remain in power they have privileged some regions against others encouraging the separatism and disintegration of our nation They have failed to pursue the economic and social advancement of the regions most in need while in power Demographic growth is economic growth so we propose policies of direct and indirect support for motherhood and work reconciliation involving all administrations progressive direct support by number of children facilities for access to housing and basic supplies and tax subsidies and deductions for those with children In general the aim is to create a strong system of support for the family which brings together institutional tributory social labour bioethics and social awareness measures which places the family at the centre of public policy and also incorporates the family perspective in the drafting of laws and provisions To help show the beauty of the family to allow young people to understand that strong families make strong societies that having children is wonderful that they are a gift that they are our greatest legacy and that ultimately there is nothing comparable to the bonds that are created in a family At the same time we are also proposing taxation in favour of anyone who wants to establish himself in rural areas with very concrete measures It is also essential to promote administrative and bureaucratic simplification processes to facilitate the establishment of self employed and enterprises Do you think it is normal that not one or two but a multitude of entrepreneurs in my province have had to put their head office in Madrid because in Ávila everything is slower more difficult more expensive and with a poorly focused hypercontrol that discourages the creation of new companies And so on For young people it is necessary to promote the generation of academic professional and vital opportunities in areas at risk of depopulation as well as access to housing by providing the necessary services to promote a strong industry and in particular to protect the vertebrating role of the agri -food industry in rural areas and to strengthen the financing and provision of education facilities in rural areas in accordance with their special characteristics We also propose an increase in the quality and quantity of public services provided in rural areas particularly in the area of health and transport in particular to meet the needs of our elderly because many are dependent and need a dedication that they are not receiving there are no pediatricians or radiation therapy units and everything has always been promised Finally the current duplication excesses and inefficiencies of administrations in the fight against depopulation must be avoided For so many good Spaniards which we cannot mention today the VOX seeders will fight to return their lives to abandoned Spain with our presence with our tireless management and thus end the punishment of banishment to which so many young people are condemned because they have the right to a job a home and to create a family in the land in which they were born and not be forced to give up their roots and their family
I 'm finishing up Thank you They have the right to accompany friends to be with their parents and not to condemn our elders to an abandonment and loneliness capable of icing any heart Ladies and gentlemen there are signs of hope dawn in Castile and León and soon the sun will shine throughout Spain Thank you very much
Thank you Mr. President Madam Minister ladies and gentlemen stop talking about equity because there is no equity in the Spanish education system as we have repeated many times The transfer of education competence to the autonomous communities means that we are currently talking only about about 6 of all that is invested in education in Spain The Ministry of Education is perhaps one of the most representative entities in terms of educational management and as the years progress inequality increases It is unjustifiable that the investment is up to 60 higher in some autonomous communities or that at the beginning of the most expensive course for inflation triggered which also affects books school materials and uniforms textbooks are still funded in some communities yes and others not when with half of the budget of the Ministry of Equality all this expenditure in primary school could be covered But these budgets also deepen the inequality of knowledge as they do not allocate a single resource to ensure something as elementary as schooling in Spanish throughout the national territory because with the competence of transferred education the Government disagrees and does not even act when it has a small margin Because why does it not activate compensation mechanisms through cohesion funds to correct the inequalities generated by the autonomous system Actually minister it does n't matter what we talk about because you also in the educational sector are focused on resilience skills gender climate green transformation and mudOS of the 2030 Agenda because for you ensuring that everyone knows our common language and history access to university is fair for everyone or the freedom of parents to educate their children according to your convictions are minor issues on which you do not consider investing resources In fact the only thing his Government assures is indoctrination for all Moreover with these budgets once again the most vulnerable and least resourced remain abandoned by his Government Their mouths are filled and they are used for inclusive education when in VOX we do not stop meeting with families with children with special educational needs absolutely underserved and victims of legislation that are made without thinking about their beneficiaries and their families So please do not say as they say that budgets have the focus on people and attention to the well being of education Because when you talk about the well being of education you are distorting the reality of our students and young people by selling them the idea that their well being passes by living comfortably and effortlessly and to be able subsidized Let the children go happy to school something legitimate that we all want for our children has nothing to do with what you are converting it and where the budget headings go a kind of theme park that forgets that the essentials of the school is the transmission and acquisition of knowledge Minister you have forgotten that it is in that process in that of the transmission of knowledge when the formation of the person comes into play and with it many variables emotional is one but it is not the only one that contribute to forging character formation that should aim at a successful life Education any good teacher knows is a balance between knowledge effort motivation emotion frustration overcoming joy the acquisition of habits and virtues The problem of this Government of this legislation of these budgets is that they turn peripheral issues into central issues relying on competitive learning that vague and diffuse concept that they use for everything and that nobody really knows what it is that jargon that even the RAE academics do not accept as they recently indicated in an information note on the new selectivity And he quoted the RAE the ministerial text reiterated in several sections the importance of teaching and evaluating in a competitive way but it does not clarify exactly what competencies are supposed to be essential nor does it explain why their acquisition should be opposed to the knowledge of the contents that have so far been considered essential And there 's nothing you can do right They initiate a reform of selectivity and instead of going to the essentials which is a unique selectivity for all Spaniards what they do are experiments and turn for example the Castilian Language test into something similar to a self school test Finally with regard to the quality of education the great novelty that they bring us in these budgets you say is to bet heavily on the digital support of the system which in fact is a bet for indiscriminate hasty and unseen digitisation of needs for a system that is already devalued and that is simply to throw away public money These budgets are a renunciation of education as a social lift Who do companies hire in the coming years if we have not asked our young people for minimums in reading reflection argumentation operations mathematics writing skills Not to mention the industrial fabric because at least the fate of the huge investment in Vocational Training more than EUR 2 billion should be reconsidered when in parallel we see no part to enhance the reindustrialisation of Spain Nor do we see a determined impulse to tackle school drop out in a general way where Spain unfortunately remains at the head of Europe It is urgent Minister to focus on the important What is it going to do for many in the ESO or for them to approve selectivity if they do not know how to read an instruction manual if they do not hold three pages in a row of reading And what will happen to so many students in public school who without mercy are inoculated degenerate ideology when what they need is along with knowledge rapport family and stability Who 's going to give hope to those students and those families Minister to form free men and women we must aim at the good and the truth the merit the value of the effort the work the excellence of the faculty and to renounce all sectarian and destructive ideologies to stop investing millions for cross-sectional education with gender ideology to stop investing millions to erase our history from the memory of our young people in the name of democratic memory to stop investing millions to encourage children and young people to doubt their identity and fearlessly change their sex to stop investing millions to approve everyone for ever less knowing to stop investing millions for inclusive education that ends with special education to stop investing millions to ruin thousands of children 's schools that have been running for years
To stop investing millions ultimately in order to put an end to the freedom of education and to impose increasingly blatantly that communist totalitarianism that equals us all in the misery and danger of opportunities that could thrive Thank you very much
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Here we are once again defending something that the Spaniards in normal circumstances in a normal country should not claim something as elementary and as common sense as the defense of the right to education in Spanish in any corner of our nation Let 's start by remembering the obvious One Catalans are Spanish as are Galicians Asturians Valencians Basques Mallorcans Andalusians Castilanoleans Two The common language of all Spaniards is Spanish Three According to the Constitution all Spaniards have the right and duty to know Spanish For this reason any family that wants to be able to school their children in Spanish must be able to do so and the State must guarantee this essential right of every Spanish resident It is not normal that in order to achieve schooling in Spanish in Catalonia it is necessary to go through a crossroad of demands and judgments which unfortunately are not fulfilled precisely because the Government of the Generality supported by the Social Communist Government of Pedro Sánchez invites systematic disobedience through autonomous laws and decrees that impose Catalan to the detriment of Spanish and which by the way we have recently appealed to the Constitutional Court In Catalonia there is not a single public centre to study in Spanish If anyone wants to get it they have to pay Says a father He paid 10,000 euros for my children to study in Spanish It was the only way out that left him in the face of harassment and toppling that his two children were suffering every day Or the father of the daughter of Canet who explains to us Up to fifteen families in school were interested in claiming their own children 's right to education in Castilian but they all ended up giving up Some preferred to save themselves problems or reproaches from their neighbors and acquaintances others worked in the Administration and feared consequences and some even recognized that they were afraid They were left alone Loneliness abandonment and defencelessness far removed from the linguistic cordiality of which Feijóo is famous In fact in Catalonia the course has begun with a totalitarian campaign against children who speak Spanish in the courtyards of Catalan schools and language commissioners are expected to be present in these areas It is irresponsible and can be offensive to speak as Mr Feijóo does of moderation serenity centrality and even linguistic cordiality when the reality that thousands of Spaniards live is of linguistic oppression In Valencia a music teacher with thirty five years of professional practice is fired for not knowing the Valencian or some parents have to report to the teacher who tells her daughter that she will lower her grade if she does homework or exams in Spanish The new Basque education law proposes Basque as the central axis of education with the approval of the PSOE of course In Asturias the People 's Party supports a PSOE motion to grant job privileges to those who know the invention of language Baleares follows the steps of Catalonia and no public school there will apply 25 in Spanish In Galicia ruled until a few months ago by Alberto Núñez Feijóo teachers are forbidden communications in Spanish access to the Public Service is discriminated against on the grounds of language and the only official form of toponyms is in Galician among other things Just last Sunday at the call in Barcelona for the School of All we were supporting the Catalans who are suffering the most who see their most elementary rights trampled because they do not have the right to school their children in their mother tongue which is also the official language of the Spanish and the official language of the State Also along with thousands of people we went to the tents of Spoken Spanish in fourteen cities and in autonomous communities where the right to school children in Spanish is violated It was a new sign of hope Regrettably however the fruit that this may bear in a Catalonia that has been making steady progress for forty years to break Spain with successive governments of the nation making divestitures of the various separatist governments is very weak That is why today once again we call for the application of Article 155 in a lasting and sustained way over time so that it restores legality in a definitive and effective way in Catalonia and guarantees the rights and freedoms of all Catalans who are trampled on today such as the right to education in freedom and in Spanish The Government of the Generality has taken over the institutions with the complicity of the Government and intends to go beyond the laws and the Constitution above coexistence and respect for court judgements We call for support from all parliamentary groups and in particular a leap of courage to the People 's Party which every time we propose the application of Article 155 which is the only effective constitutional measure to preserve the fundamental rights of Catalans is to propose at best an amendment abolishing the application of this Article Article 155 ladies and gentlemen is precisely a valuable tool that gives us the Constitution to correct cases of rebellion such as the one perpetrated by the Government of the Generality All of you recognize that the language is being used as a political weapon of separatism in Spain to divide us Spanish into something that keeps us united which is the language not only within Spain but with millions of Spanish speakers all over the world We live in a kind of reverse world where our main heritage is dilapidated and despised which is the language that unites us Let us not forget that this is not an exclusive problem of Catalonia and comes from the linguistic policies of the different autonomous communities with co-official language which by the way pushed the People 's Party Balearics Galicia and therefore affects us all the Spaniards who want to reside or move through any of our autonomous communities It 's very worrying that many people are following the trail"
I 'm finishing up of the false success of the linguistic immersion achieved in Catalonia which is nothing more than a deception a stupendous failure an attack on freedom of education and a long history of imposition harassment markings and exiles Thank you very much
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen A unique public and secular school That is the dream of Podemos that crystallizes in what we propose today which is basically to stay with the concerted centers that go wrong and that nobody wants either because they have lost the spirit of the ideal that animated them either because they are on the verge of economic bankruptcy and so appear as their savior By the way gentlemen of Podemos these centers are also public only that in addition to public they are free That is all very far from a serious proposal to improve public education in Spain without objectives without project without adaptation to the times we live with four maximums and forward According to data from the Ministry of Education public education is the one that loses more students in recent years than private and concerted education But we already know that the communists like the fascists know that the way to do things with a nation is first of all by adding to the educational system even if that comes out expensive as is the case because each school that passes to the state costs twice as much to the administration as if it is administered by the concerted Now the situation is more serious In addition to the communist education that fosters one on one education in certain toxic hate poisoned ideologies which lead to moral and economic misery and which disables young people to develop their own thinking we now have the addition of the furious attack on children through an affective sexual education of gender ideology that will leave generations of children not only incapable of long range love which is based on dedication sacrifice generosity selfless donation and whose most beautiful fruit are children but which will leave them absolutely confused about their sexual identity which is one of the members from which personal identity is shaped This bill is full of lies One of them is that it claims to be based on the Spanish Constitution In the explanatory statement public education is confused with education adding freely to the constitutional text article 27.4 of which simply states that basic education is compulsory and free of charge What happens is that once again we can confuse gratuitousness with the state and the public but again we are here to remind you that gratuitousness can be achieved in many ways In the field of education one of them is the concerted school another is the school check which operates in many European countries and is rapidly opening up in the United States Ladies and gentlemen of Podemos in order to legislate in accordance with the Constitution article 27 must be read and interpreted in its entirety without infringing any of the paragraphs that make up it In particular article 27.3 which refers to the right of parents to educate their children according to their own convictions should not be overlooked I wish this were guaranteed by the public school We will all sign for taking our children to the school that is next door to home to a school where our children learn what to learn in school to read write and think through what their teachers teach them in different subjects However the reality is that many families are making a great effort to take their children to other schools that respond to the values and principles with which they want to educate them and in the humblest areas there is more demand Many of these concerted schools are a real oasis in neighbourhoods where life for children and young people is very difficult With this bill aware of the difficult situation in the concerted school We want to give all kinds of facilities for them to give up their educational projects and quickly take advantage of those schools in crisis But let 's see what the parties involved say the representatives of the concerted school I hope that no concerted school will become public says Meritxell Ruiz secretary general of the Christian School of Catalonia Luis Centeno secretary general of Catholic Schools who joins 2000 centres and 1,200 000 pupils says We can not stop harassing the concerted one The LOMLOU is short and they want to take advantage of the last year of government to encourage public concerted confrontation a drama for our educational system To Alfonso Aguiló president of CECE the text of Podemos reminds him of the nationalization plans that have been so common in authoritarian regimes Instead of financing the concerted they prefer to suffocate it and then absorb it at a balance price On the basis of public money he says they want to reduce plurality in school and that in addition to being unfair is a step backwards in rights In the light of these statements it is clear that this proposal for a law does not at all form part of the social consensus since they have not even spoken to the affected party which is the one that supposedly would want to be integrated voluntarily what a perverse euphemism into the public network In fact there are institutions run by families professionals or other religious congregations that can assume schools and also some bishops would be disposed through diocesan schools Just take off the phone and if the educational administrations want to do something offer help so that these other options can be viable This measure is not going to achieve a more free tolerant and cohesive society at all as they say in the text of the bill but more social confrontations and I doubt that even the Socialist Group voted in favour In VOX what hurts us is that they are precisely the humblest and simplest Spaniards the most harmed by initiatives like this Our dream is a public school of quality devoid of any ideology with teachers and teachers with vocation busy in transmitting knowledge to make their students more free and to ensure that the education they receive is truly a social lift Teachers who transmit passion and love for knowledge and truth the basis on which students can build their freedom and make their nation prosperous I wish we had a public school where vulnerable families did not have to give up educating their children in their most intimate beliefs a public school where mathematics and non-ecofeminism were taught"
I 'm just finishing up a public school that was a social elevator and a source of opportunities and not of de generate sexual assemblies and talks a public school in which the most modest families did not have to leave their children concerned about whether they were going to have teachers or activists I wish we had a public school that created free men and women Thank you very much
"Ladies and gentlemen after the unfortunate spectacle of the use of the control session for acts of electoral propaganda we have to do our part to represent the citizens who voted for us throughout Spain Here only retirees and civil servants remain explains a sorian of forty five years who went to Madrid to study the career and never returned In press we read Villages of Valladolid without children We 're doomed to disappear Half a hundred municipalities did not have a registered person under five years of age in January 2021 Another Leonese transport calls for measures against rising prices Each truck spends 1200 euros more per month of fuel than a year ago the field workers are sick of it We just over a week ago joined Madrid 's macro demonstration against its policies which led to their disappearance Laurean a farmer from Palencia warns us The wolf 's problem is very fat the danger is the disappearance of the cattle not the wolf because there are many who have to leave it because of the wolves I had sheep and I took them because the wolf was tying it up and there are cattle farms that can disappear because of that And it goes on If the wolf continues to multiply this way you can run the risk even of attacking people if people stand here in the field What they say Laureano tells us of emptied Spain Spain is not emptied it is vacillated and forgotten In Ávila my dear province there 's a great deal of untapped potential Ten years ago it took him to arrive by train thirty to forty minutes less than what it takes today because although it seems incredible it is a journey that today lasts two hours Or the tremendous case of the AVE which promised the People 's Party government twenty years ago and then re-promised and never fulfilled Promises and only promises that of course no one believes anymore something that the Castilians and Leons should not forget nor should they forget the restrictions on freedom the imposition of curfews and harassment on the hoteliers or the toll on the highway which today costs 20 euros round and round which the users have been paying for forty years and which still with their Government will have to continue paying Or the shortage of bus service throughout the province It could continue with health with the languishing industry and with the slow death of local trade This is just a sample of Spain abandoned and silenced A sepulchral silence reigns in many of its squares There are no children or families and the elderly who are very old hardly leave the house Spain is in a very serious demographic situation that threatens its survival The loss of population and its ageing are accelerated each year In Galicia Asturias and Castile and Leon die more than double the number of people born In Zamora Leon Asturias and Soria the proportion is three deaths per birth If current birth and life expectancy rates are maintained by 2055 there will be more people of seventy eight years of age than people in any other age group The demographic winter is a cancer that affects our entire nation but it is advancing in some territories faster than in others those of Spain abandoned by you political leaders of the PSOE and the People 's Party And it is that the economic situation of these regions is in free fall because without children there is no future without demographic growth there is no economic growth and this economic downturn makes investment something vital linked to birth less attractive for that Spain so worthy and necessary and of which we are so proud Let us see the example of Castile and León the cradle of our history and where the People 's Party has ruled for thirty five years He is a leader in depopulation almost 200,000 Spaniards have had to leave this region since you ruled ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party He is a leader in expelling young university students a punishment of exile for being Castilian Leonese The Community of Castile and León is the main expelling zone for qualified persons from all over Spain He is the leader in the ageing and ageing population the second oldest region in Europe after Asturias 26 of Castilians and Leonians are sixty five years old or older and 36 are over eighty years old many of them dependent with neurodegenerative problems and insufficient care due to the large dispersal of the population living in small villages with little inhabitants and without services Because depopulation causes one to enter a vicious circle in which among other things social services worsen dramatically And the worst ladies and gentlemen minister leader in solitude Castilla y León is Spain 's second largest autonomous community with more people living alone no less than 30 Our elders those who have taught us the value of work and family those who preserve our traditions our roots our cultural heritage are alone and abandoned scattered and poorly cared for Grandparents who have seen how their families children and grandchildren have had to leave the village and its province to look for work and to build a life Minister the repopulation of rural Spain is crucial to ensuring prosperity and territorial vertebration The ministry to which you represent of Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge will not solve this problem because it is only a branch of the globalist elites who want to impose concepts such as ecological transition global strategies resilience and sustainable development goals bono masks of the perverse 2030 Agenda We on the other hand propose another life to the Spaniards to the children to the young and to the elderly And with us for the moment half Europe that of the sovereign nations and soon much of America because we must regain our national sovereignty defend our lifestyle our customs our traditions our history our roots and our borders also our industry and our system of sovereign production which allows us to live from what we produce and not be subject to the unfair competition of third parties We have a duty to think and to propose all the measures that are necessary for companies and entrepreneurs to be able to establish and maintain themselves in those territories for example with favourable taxation Because we defend equality between Spaniards and we are going to face the insurgency of the autonomous state which creates first and second Spaniards which prevents water from reaching where it is needed and with a fair distribution and above all which penalizes the regions most loyal to Spain and its identity The Popular Party in Castile and León is what the PSOE has been in Andalusia a client and caciquil network that prevents the growth of the provinces to have them controlled the power at the cost of the Spanish Today we have just witnessed a farce in which the People 's Party shows that it is against the PSOE when in reality it is subject to the same dictates of the globalist agenda and defending that agenda is compatible with defending the true interests of the Spaniards and our sovereignty Ladies and gentlemen of the PP or Agenda Spain or Agenda 2030 or the interests of the Spanish and Spain or the interests of the globalist elites or our traditions our culture our roots our nation or the existential vacuum And at this moment I allow myself to address our young people because we are here for them and for those children who listen to us many of whom cannot even vote Dear young people do n't be fooled The promise of an easy and subsidized life is a deception to have you controlled and subdued to make you unable to build something for yourself Do n't let them fool you All those who now rule bad than good have grown up in a family that no one questioned because it was always there with its lights and with its shadows They want to leave you orphans so that you have no choice but to fall into the hands of the state Dear young people I have not resigned you connected with your roots connected with your Spanish heart the same one that encouraged Don Pelayo the Cid Augustine of Aragon Teresa of Jesus Blas of Lezo Pedro Claver Ignatius of Loyola John of the Cross and from there draw strength and illusion to build a family Enthusiasts lovers of life do not be afraid to love do not flee from effort and sacrifice when it comes to achieving an ideal a greater good such as building a family getting a job or raising children Do not renounce to spend your time listening to your parents your grandparents your great grandfathers their legacy is our history do not abandon them Abandon selfishness the great deception of our time Do not prove to your elders the joy of a grandchildren who break into their solitude and above all do not deprive yourselves of the possibility of a successful life Do not be deceived dear young people you deserve a family a job and a homeland do not resign Minister the solution is to give our young people opportunities and boost birth not to import millions of irregular immigrants Other European nations such as Poland and Hungary have already done so Hungary for example has created a strong family support system achieving a very significant increase in birth rate Do not be ashamed to recognize that the family is the basic cell of society the natural place where children are born and where the bonds that last all life are generated where strong free and self owned virtuous people grow But submitted as is his ministry and all the Government that represents the dictates of the supranational agendas it is difficult for them to understand that the family is the cornerstone of civilization and must be promoted and protected if birth is to be promoted To this end Minister you must change false stereotypes and stop presenting family and marriage as oppressive institutions and children as burdens Lately not only do they tell us barbarities like cows pollute but even children pollute and that to curb climate change the solution is to have fewer children Madam Minister be aware of the serious problem we have in our hands The Spaniards want to eat products from the land and not synthetic meat We want safe villages full of families not wolf herds where castles walls and temples do not fall to pieces We want to see happy children with their parents and grandparents filling schools and parks and not desolate villages We want young people with work full of confidence in their future and not sunk into a senseless life and subjected to the penalty of banishment In short we want the Spaniards to be proud of their homeland Thank you very much"
Minister less rhetoric and more words Facts none you just said it You are testimony to your own words The truth is that paper supports everything Pay more attention to the people of the countryside and follow their advice tread the ground There are slogans from farmers who say From the country to the house Well hey from the country to Congress Go to the camp listen to them and then legislate based on what you 've heard Your Honor it 's not that difficult it 's a matter of listening It is also a question of listening to each other when we are here in the Chamber I have talked about a whole series of issues that you have not answered You have told me that I have ridiculed the situation of the people of Spain It 's just that you have n't gone there you can see that you have n't gone That is the dramatic situation of our farmers our farmers and many areas that are running out of population I have n't made any suffamation about the children that every woman can have However I have addressed a very important issue that you logically are unable to address what is the problem of birth We have to bet on birth we have to bet on policies that favor family and birth but that goes against their ideological and globalist policies In fact we have already asked some questions in this regard What measures will the Government take to promote birth in all regions of Spain And you have answered us and I read literally Policies aimed only at promoting fertility involve perpetuating the gender stereotypes that must be combated as they lead to an increase in gender gaps and support a reductionist reproductive oriented vision of women That ladies and gentlemen is your vision of motherhood and women You have to put an end to as many complex policies as you have in other European countries I 'll tell you what gynecologists tell their patients in Hungary when they announce a new pregnancy They do n't tell you you 're pregnant do you want to have it They tell you you 're pregnant congratulations A positive and celebrative vision of motherhood is transmitted and lived Please note ladies and gentlemen especially those who are going to vote against those people who are just praying in front of abortion clinics tomorrow Ladies and gentlemen minister the truth is that there are so many things to tell you that we will see if I can put order We have gone to listen to the people of the countryside In fact the 52 of VOX when we make proposals not of law proposals of law parliamentary questions is not that we are there in the dispatch telling to see what we think or to see this news No we 've gone to our provinces we 've talked to people and surprisingly people no matter how much they are hoteliers merchants farmers and farmers all the people we see are surprised that a congressman goes and talks to them But what have they done What have you done for forty years of democracy in this country Real Spain that of the countryside has been marginalized by the media for years and ignored by politicians by you and by you silenced in the chatter in the dishes there is no talk of family of well being of opportunities of prosperity or of the future In fact I think you will also have to talk to one of the Members who spoke this morning who said that Spain must be populated That goes against their policies as we have already commented You in your answer it was predictable was n't it were going to talk about mobility connectivity and child education But for who if there are no children I was going to talk about consulting Yes clinics are missing because for the few children we lack pediatricians in my province there are fewer and fewer pediatricians Older people who are more and more in need of a lot of care have fewer and fewer services Energy transition of mobility they want the Spaniards not to understand them when you speak Maintaining and consolidating the provision of services but if they have not done so until now why do we have to think that they will do so now Finally we really come to bring hope to Spain and to tell all Spaniards that it is possible to live with hope and that we have the right to another future
With all due respect Madam President Minister allow me to address my first words to the Communist spokesman whom I see he has already left who with whom he is falling has given him for accusing us of sexists and has spoken of his grandmother but he has forgotten the grandmothers who are suffering because they have seen his daughters being raped by criminals who are seeing their sentences reduced by the law of it is only yes The spokesman has been forgotten the three reports of the General Council of the Judiciary that warned that this was going to happen and of course the Iranian women who must also be second class women have been forgotten Minister I 'm with you The Government has flown the bells as you have explained to us very well by firing the expenditure into a situation of economic crisis Looks like there 's no tomorrow using a Keynesian aggravation In the long run everyone dies and these problems are solved by others Let 's see what your government wants because when the numbers are shuddered things get very well understood If we take programme 142.A action by the Spanish State abroad we see that its main objective is to defend and promote the political and economic interests of Spain vis-à vis third States and the international bodies to which it is a party to enhance its influence on the definition of the international strategy of peace and security to improve its external image as well as to guarantee to the Spanish citizens the protection they may need outside our borders and to facilitate the exercise of their rights That has only decided to increase by 1.9 That is what Spain 's political and economic interests matter to you That 's the reality not the one you told us If you want another example we look at the Secretariat of State for Ibero America and the Caribbean and Spanish in the World which has a endowment of 86 million It seemed a small figure to me but 80 of those millions are taken by the Cervantes Institute Moreover if we remove the 1.3 taken by the House of America 2.6 of the staff and 0.6 for Mr Sánchez presidency we see that the Secretariat of State for Ibero America and the Caribbean and Spanish in the World can do little or nothing with these scarce resources However transfers and deliveries have grown by 41.5 the AECID as you have very well explained has grown by 53 increasing its contribution by more than 196 million euros This is the case with official development assistance and the Government understands that it is necessary to help outside it is necessary to help outside rather than within our borders When the Spanish families cannot reach the end of the month when the companies are suffering enormously from the crazy costs of their supplies we trigger international cooperation in development aid which is 23 in the general budgets of the State to strategic contributions to bilateral development organizations more than 50 million the Development Promotion Fund is increased by more than 20 million up to 219 million euros I recall that the Secretariat of State for Ibero America the Caribbean and Spanish in the World was 86 million while the Development Promotion Fund was 219 million There are more than 100 million in current transfers that have seen an increase of 35 million to non-profit institutions and about 145 million go abroad It 's amazing is n't it What are you guys doing One might think that Mr. Sánchez 's trip to Ibero America was an election trip that what he was doing was promoting himself to become Secretary General of the Socialist International and some might say that the trip is getting very expensive Can you tell me on your trip to the Balkans and on Mr Sánchez 's trips to Ibero America what commercial successes we have achieved for Spanish companies and for the general interest of the State Because what we do know is the results in their elections to the Socialist International It should be noted that in the general budgets of the State for the year 2023 fifteen studies and reports on the objectives of the 2030 Agenda are growing which is to increase by ten the five that were collected in the budgets of the year 2022 I would like to point out that as time goes by AIReF has reduced its education budget by 50 That is to say we are going to spend more money on the studies for the 2030 Agenda on the foreign budget than the budget that the AIReF has in the tragic situation in which we are The things that the AIReF says about their budgets do n't seem to like them and they punish them To the Spanish Presidency of the European Union EUR 160 million I think this is an absolutely important date and we have to do it very well but do we have to spend EUR 160 million in six months 160 million euros In short the growth of 28 of development aid throughout the General Administration of the State is getting very expensive it is very expensive to find all of you the whole government for when you lose the next elections You are indebted to your communist partners and to the enemies in Spain Is it normal for Minister Irene Montero on her recent trip to Argentina to hide from the diplomatic corps the meetings with the Vice President of the Government of Argentina with the Minister of Economy with the Minister of the Interior Is it normal that the new ambassador of Spain you have authorized Yuri Klimenko exconsul in Barcelona who supported traitors and secessionists and that everyone knows the Russian interference in the failed coup of Esquerra and its partners be ambassador in Spain Is it normal that in the meeting we had last week with the Ukrainian delegation here in the Congress of Deputies there were none of the coup parties either on the left or the PNV Is it normal that they did n't come Is that the support of your government partners because neither were the Lords of Podemos a the Ukrainian Members who came to see us What are the commercial revenues of your travels Five start up agencies In short Your Honor I believe let us hope you will leave soon that these are the government 's placement budgets
President ladies and gentlemen I am looking at a mixture of satisfaction and apprehension The satisfaction is that this is the last budgetary device that the Socialist and Communist coalition government is going to bring to this House because they will lose the next elections The horror is for the terrible legacy that you are going to leave in Spain a destroyed economy with a position of your unsustainable public finances Recalling Winston Churchill in a similar situation to which he so much likes to mention Mr Sánchez he said some illustrative words Never before in the history of democracy I add the Spanish had so much damage been done by such small men This budget is based on nothing a macro- economic picture dead before it was born and disqualified by all No one believes in their growth forecast for 2023 and therefore their income projections and deficit target are unsustainable But with that being the manifestation of the constant lack of rigour of this Government it is not the most serious The essential question as always is the sacrifice of the general interests of Spain of the well being of the Spaniards and of the future of their economy on the altar of a fiscal and budgetary demagogy placed at the service of alicorts and mediocre partisan interests and of course of the enemies of Spain Your new budgetary monster Mrs Montero is the final stalemate of the policy applied by you since your sad and unfortunate arrival in power a constant rise in public spending and taxes Since 2018 the first has increased by almost 40 in nominal terms The second the taxes by 31 while what has happened with GDP That we are the only nation in the European Union that has not recovered the GDP levels of 2019 This dynamic of irrational expansion of the state in the economy has placed Spanish public accounts in a dramatic position of extraordinary vulnerability in a context of accelerated decline of activity and rise of interest rates No economy can maintain growth rates of its spending that double the increase in its income and even less so when this upswing in addition to being accompanied by an unprecedented rise in the taxation of entrepreneurs and families need to be financed with debt a debt that is close to 120 of GDP And to close this vicious circle its waste and tax voracity have been accompanied by a permanent and unprecedented increase in the structural deficit They have never bothered to put forward a medium term stabilization plan and despite the extraordinary income achieved in 2021 with the aid of the inflationary tax we will close 2022 with a deficit of around 5 of GDP What about budgets that take up EUR 583 billion of expenditure including debt service a record figure in the national annals that once again increase structural expenditure and call into question the solvency and financial sustainability of the Spanish State What about the new tax figures which with those carried out so far constitute the biggest tax increase made by a Spanish Government in a legislature since the establishment of democracy and with an economy on the verge of a technical recession You have already passed ladies and gentlemen the People 's Party What about the increase in social contributions in a crisis scenario weakening the labour market which does not even serve to prevent social security from running a deficit In fact ladies and gentlemen there is only one thing to say leave leave as soon as possible because only from that moment will it be possible to have some hope in the future What a pitiful example the example given by some members of the Government I do not include you Minister whom you studied Medicine who were supposed to know something very concrete that never at any time or place a fiscal and budgetary policy such as that which they have supported and support ever served anywhere in the world to reduce the deficit debt and boost the recovery of the economy How has Mr Escrivá for example lent himself to this and already excludes Mrs Calviño Ladies and gentlemen today we are attending a funeral that of a government that has carried out the worst economic and budgetary management of democracy His legacy will be a case of study no doubt of how an economic situation such as that faced by Spain is not addressed We have had a bad government under dramatic circumstances and we are paying a high price for it I trust and hope that the Spaniards who are the victims of their actions will return them to their rightful place the political irrelevance in the opposition Let 's see if a long stay in the purge of the Socialist Party helps them to regain responsibility and sanity because the one who is following his agenda is the Communist Party Thank you very much
With all due respect Madam President His lordship of Bildu asked if anyone knew what the resignation or termination of CNI director Paz Esteban was due to I think all of Spain knows the reasons The reasons were you Mr de Esquerra and Mr de PNV who have taken over the government where you want it At least they had the dignity as you have rightly pointed out to cease with all the dignity that is owed to them You asked a question and I also ask you do you know ladies and gentlemen of Bildu who are the material perpetrators of the 379 unresolved ETA crimes Do you know ladies and gentlemen of Bildu who are the material perpetrators of 40 of the unsolved murders of ETA Do you know ladies and gentlemen of Bildu why there are still attacks on people civil guards children of politicians or civilians who do not think the same as you do in the Basque Country and Navarre Do you know ladies and gentlemen of Bildu why the ETA butchers continue to be honoured CNI 's mission is to work to protect Spanish society that puts it on its website I 'm sure they 've read it trying to anticipate threats to Spanish society gathering information and turning it into intelligence The PNV asks us to amend two laws Law 11/2002 and Organic Law 2/2002 of 6 May regulating the prior judicial control of the National Intelligence Centre On the one hand what they want is greater judicial control but they do n't want greater judicial control for a reason but what they want is to bring it to inoperative so that it 's not operational They want there to be three judges as the spokesman for Citizens has explained very well before three judges one from the PNV one from the PSOE and one from Podemos Or not Like the control they want from the judiciary That is what you would like and therefore not to be operational Besides they want to know the means employed I was surprised that you did not come here to talk about how intelligence services work in other neighbouring nations of ours as you have done on other occasions and that you did not make a comparison to see if what is in Spain is more or less Look this initiative is from the month of May One might think that the slow moving coup d'état being led by the Sánchez government had already been aligned with their wishes since May How curious that they present it now when we 're watching the assault on the judiciary I believe that what you are asking is not balanced It is not balanced in our region and is outside the usual customs and customs in any criminal case as it has already been exposed and therefore I will not stop at it Then they want political control They want the president to appoint a secretary of state who is responsible to be able to ask for responsibilities from someone who owes you to be in the government while the logical thing would be that there were professionals in an agency that is to defend Spain and to defend Spanish society professionals who were not in the political arena You want more political control we want more technicians at the service of Spain Therefore the initiative presented by his group the Basque Parliamentary Group seeks to weaken the National Intelligence Centre and is imbued with partisan and spurious interests Thus it seeks to amend article 6.2 of Law 11/2002 This fact is very enlightening as it contains the same wording that the Government gave to the same paragraph in the second final provision of Royal Decree Law 8/2020 of 17 March which was declared unconstitutional by Judgment 110/2021 of 13 May of the Constitutional Court So it 's not that you 're worried about justice it 's not that you 're worried about the security of Spain you 're worried about what the CNI can investigate you 're worried about them being able to investigate the more than twenty cases of corruption in which the PNV or former PNV agents are involved which is logical when someone has been ruling for so long He said someone that power corrupts but more corrupts absolute power which is what you have had for many years in the Basque Country That is why we confront them with calmness with patience and above all seeking virtue for these Spanish lands Thank you very much
With all due respect Madam President Ladies and gentlemen of Podemos the Spanish economy has been facing the third economic crisis since 2008 Following the sudden contraction of GDP caused by the pandemic Spain has been the only one of the major countries in the European Union that has not recovered its levels of GDP in 2019 and has not increased those levels It is now facing the greatest supply shock experienced since the 1970s under precarious conditions because of its fault unsustainable public sector indebtedness a labour market whose rigidities have increased its counter work reform it is now more difficult to create jobs very indebted families and companies with declining incomes a crazy taxation and a new energy shock caused by the war in Ukraine which brings us to the head of a scenario of stagnation This scenario compounded by its macroeconomic irresponsibility has resulted in a devastating blow for businesses and families who have not yet overcome the effects of COVID 19 and are entering a path that punishes and punishes their income and standard of living with enormous hardship In the midst of the current electroshock you maintain a macroeconomic picture that constitutes an insult to intelligence everything is frivolity a policy of gestures at the service of the President of the Government 's agenda committed to showing an image of statesman that is pathetic To make the situation even worse they have taken a radical turn in foreign policy towards Morocco without consulting anyone without passing through Parliament violating the resolutions all of international bodies on the Sahara and putting at risk the relationship with Algeria which is our first gas supplier If doing this in a normal scenario is essential doing so in the midst of the worst economic crisis that Spain and the European Union have experienced in the past forty years is suicidal and can only be explained for reasons completely outside the national interest Maybe that 's the price to pay for Mr. Sanchez to get a slap in the back of the sea A supply shock caused by the increase in energy costs is not dampened by more public spending by price controls or by trapping the solitaire in the Falcon the only short term way to alleviate the impact on businesses and families is by reducing or suppressing taxation which falls on electricity and hydrocarbons which artificially raises the energy costs borne by Spanish families This has been done by most of the States of the European Union and you do not want to pay attention because the rise in these prices provides them with extraordinary income for their energy demagogy and to make that agenda that you believe is necessary to continue to govern This only helps to delay the exit from the crisis to introduce ourselves into a new one without having come out of the previous one and to increase the economic and social costs that we will have to bear in order to overcome both But the brutal upward impact of energy prices is also a demonstration of where its blindness and energy policy can lead us because it does not guarantee Spain 's security of supply Its obsession is to shut down nuclear power plants its criminalization of all non-renewable technologies its stubborn opposition to greater interconnection with France and a long time and so on have exacerbated and exacerbated Spain 's energy vulnerability if there is no drastic change in orientation His action in the field of energy is like the horse riding of Atila 's horse leaving nothing alive in his path His incompetence is known his sectarianism I manifest his irresponsibility clear To the sluggishness that you write every day you should add a new qualification for your government you are gaffes They attract upon themselves all imaginable biblical and deep plagues and aggravate them with their pitiful measures This government is in K.O. Technician Unfortunately the prolongation of their agony is in their hands delaying the moment when citizens expel them from power and in the meantime their ability to do harm is enormous Every day Mr Sánchez and his party partners remain in the Moncloa harder and harder it will be to rebuild the Spanish economy As Larry Browne said socialism breaks your legs and then gives you some crutches or as Margaret Thatcher said socialism goes well until someone else 's money runs out But I prefer a Spanish saying year of reds hunger and lice Thank you very much
Thank you very much Madam President The PNL proposed by Unidad Podemos constitutes a new and demagogic attack on the foundations of an economy the Spanish one capable of creating wealth employment and well being for all In this the initiative of the communist formation differs only from the socialist one in the intensity of the fiscal voraciousness that characterizes the partners of this government They are determined to expropriate the fruits of the effort and talent of Spanish families and companies It is surprising that a party sitting on the Council of Ministers is proposing on its own a change in the Spanish tax system This only shows the absolute chaos in which the Government is immersed and its absolute lack of consistency It can be assumed that the socialist silence in the face of the initiative of its partners is in agreement with it although for tactical reasons it does not consider it appropriate to support it at the moment But what is serious is not as Mrs Calviño has suggested that the situation does not recommend raising taxes what is serious is the philosophy underlying the Puemita proposal They want to annihilate the already damaged incentives of the Spaniards to work save and invest They want to turn us into subjects of tax exploitation at the service of the ideological delusions of the left This is due not only to an overwhelming economic ignorance but also to a rampant demagogy whose goal is only one to destroy the market economy and to impoverish the Spanish The United Nations GNP We can reflect a deep ignorance of a tax system the Spanish which first of all has one of the highest levels of progressiveness in the OECD secondly the marginal rates of the IRPF apply from much lower levels of income than those in all Western economies thirdly the Spanish companies bear a tax pressure that is 27.2 higher than the European Union average and 21 higher than the OECD average and fourthly the taxation on assets in Spain is 40.8 higher than the European Union average and 38 higher than the OECD average This is the reality Here 's the data This is the information on the tax competitiveness index of the Tax Foundation an organization founded in 1935 therefore nothing to do with Franco Mr Echenique The social communist coalition is turning Spain into a fiscal hell in a place where work savings and investment are considered crimes of lesser majesty by the ruling majority and the PSOE is the enthusiastic travel companion complicit of the communists on the road to the consolidation of a tax system confiscation unjust and why not say so deeply immoral And not content with this they want to deepen in that direction which would worsen the serious problems of the Spanish economy and especially of the people who have less Unido Podemos and its coalition partners are not interested in improving the living conditions of the most disadvantaged sections of Spanish society of those most in need and it must be recognized that their GNP is consistent with this strategy They prefer that the poor be poorer so that the rich are less rich so that the Spaniards become hostages of a left that in a magnanimous way will distribute transfers and subsidies to them to those who snatch the fruits of their effort that is their resources In short chavismo for pure sale The proposal of the tax genocide proposed by the United Nations We can only lead to depressing the rate of savings and investment to encourage the exit of high value added financial and human capital and therefore to intensify the slowdown of an economy that has not emerged from the crisis and is increasingly moving away from recovery and increasingly from our European partners The initiative will not bring any significant change to the better for the Spaniards with greater economic problems those most in need because there is no collection capacity almost zero His whole policy is based on deception and lies on confronting some Spaniards with others on generating resentment on appealing to the lowest passions of the human being and on an encyclopedic ignorance of the consequences of the measures they propose The productive sectors of the Spanish economy can no longer withstand suffocating fiscal pressure Its conception of the tax system is that of a farm in which the role of citizens and businesses is only one to be organized to serve their interests and the delusions of politicians That is why my group will vote against your proposal When the Spaniards give us their confidence and we reach the government VOX will propose a tax reform that allows citizens to enjoy the fruits that are earned honestly by their effort and their talent and companies to be competitive to generate wealth and employment employment and wealth In the meantime Mr Echenique we will fight with all our strength and with all our energy your tax policy on burned land Thank you very much
With venom the president More ultra ladies and gentlemen more ultra We need to go beyond that With inflation fired as we have and with the more than forty two times which I will then explain that this government has raised taxes we cannot say that we are going to deflate inflation only to the three small sections of the IRPF The rest of the Spaniards what are they thieves bandits Do n't you earn your savings and your money by working honestly Why are they excluded from this deflation by the People 's Party That 's why we encourage them to go beyond beyond We need the Spaniards to get the rent back As you know very well inflation does what it does is to reduce purchasing capacity and the rise in taxes progressiveness what it reduces is disposable income The Government twice punishes the Spaniards with their misdeeds Firstly with a policy that generates higher inflation than that of the rest of the countries of the European Union Switzerland which has also experienced the COVID and which also suffers from the Ukraine war in Putin before it is mentioned has an inflation of 3.5 And it also makes them lose disposable income by raising taxes although the minister who is not here for a change promised and promised that she would not raise them Ms. Calviño stated that the increase in inflation was temporary and kept saying it basically until yesterday speaking in colloquial terms Well it seems that Mrs. Calviño is always wrong you 'd have to put her in the Guinness record It is true that the war in Ukraine has a negative effect on the CPI no doubt but it must be remembered that in February the CPI rose by 7.6 and the war began on 24 February that is inflation was already triggered At the moment the activity rate as you know is 58.71 against 74.3 in the European Union and the so called Spanish poverty rate is 22.6 against 16.4 This is the reality and it is obviously relevant to highlight it The use of the European Central Bank to monetise the bulk of the debt generated by its obscene increase in spending along with its permanent refusal to introduce liberalisation measures to give more flexibility to markets and facilitate their adaptation to shocks has fuelled and accentuated the inflationary tensions of the Spanish economy This is clearly shown by the increase in underlying inflation which denotes the strong structural component of Spanish inflation And if inflation is reduced a little bit it does n't mean that the Spaniards recover the lost what it means is that they lose a little less purchasing power Did n't anyone teach them in the faculty that price controls are an ineffective and harmful measure to fight inflation Hacienda has made August with inflation and collects more than 22 billion euros To explain it to you a good year the IRPF which is the tax that most collects collects 78 billion Corporate tax in 2021 raised 26 billion in 2019 it raised 23 billion That is without anyone approving this extra collection the Government of the State is currently collecting more than 22 billion This is a robbery it 's an indecency and it 's immoral Ladies and gentlemen inflation erodes the income of families and reduces competitiveness for businesses that is it overwhelmingly punishes those who create wealth in Spain and does more harm to the poorest Its sole beneficiary is its Government which is helped by the rise of the CPI to finance and continue its waste This is not only aberrant in terms of economic rationality but as I said earlier immoral You express to the Spaniards to pursue their ideological purposes and in return offer them the crumbs of what they are taking away from us the 400 euros for children to buy video games etc. They are impoverishing the Spanish middle class which is in a unique situation in all these years of democracy after having promoted 42 single tax revenues 8 increases from the IRPF 4 increases from the company tax an increase from the property tax an increase from the value added even if they have dropped it in social contributions 17 increases 17 climbs equals those of the companies than those of the workers because all the workers pay them and therefore we asked the People 's Party to go a little further and we would ask for an ultra plus go further We are very pleased with this measure and we very much thank the People 's Party for echoing the report presented by the Dissenso Foundation in March of this year which was published in all the media By the way by a professor who was the one who coined
I 'm done a professor who coined that phrase lowering taxes is from the left which he said at the beginning Zapatero Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
"Thank you Madam President Madam Minister of Defence when following the invasion of Ukraine she appeared in the Commission our parliamentary group urged her to step up our defence effort He then replied he will remember that we will never reach 2 committed to the allies at the 2014 Wales Summit A few days later the spokesman for the Socialist Parliamentary Group said otherwise and in that they are now where I said Diego and tomorrow we do not know Let us return to what we always have this extreme left government has no defence policy and does not have it because the interests of Spain sovereignty security prosperity and even the nation itself which is what must be protected have it without care It is therefore pointless that section 14 of this draft budget for ruin is due to any rationality beyond trying to please our partners and allies and to cover the most urgent shortcomings identified by the Chief of Staff among the many that the long standing incuria has caused in the Armed Forces But now we are here to dispatch a procedure Mrs Margarita and in five minutes we will tell you why we do not agree with your accounts as much as it comes boasting of a budget increase of almost 26 25 billion euros with the scandal of your fellow communists terrorists and coupsmen who of all things are who would like to see the national state become weaker and Spain helpless The times are not for frivolities or indifference minister because the world today is very competitive A distinguished member of his department once told me that Spain could not participate in an arms race a non-small excuse but that Morocco and Algeria are the powers that in the Strait region are holding the arms race which will lead the first to equal our defence budget and the second to double it What we should be concerned about is that the geopolitical coordinates in which Spain stands have an objective risk before which it must play a relevant role as a strategic actor with its partners and allies yes but under any circumstances it must maintain military security to deal with emerging threats because the main commitment of the Armed Forces Minister is the defence of Spain itself Having said that it does not seem to us that those seven years that your government has given to reach the legendary 2 of Wales are a reasonable time That quota represents a minimum a minimum that was estimated in 2014 to be reached in ten years We are in 2022 and the war has surprised Europe two years earlier Mrs Robles the year 2029 can be too late for Spain as has been 2024 for the European Union as jealous of its strategic autonomy as it is unable to face its risks without the American presence What about our country which has been Europe 's red light in the defence effort Let 's go to the numbers It is not easy to argue clearly because your department 's accounts have been aggravating with clarity as a result of their complexity masking and uncertainty To begin with if we look at the figures for special modernisation programmes they increase to more than 38 of the department 's resources while the rest of the applications including personnel and force preparation costs increase by a modest 8.5 We 're not gonna get any better with this With regard to the major investment programmes we have already warned its Secretary of State that the multi-annual payments already committed by the Ministry of Defence according to data from the General Intervention of the State Administration amount to about 30 billion euros which together with the more than 20,000 corresponding to the new programmes total 50 billion euros This means that if similar resources were to be devoted in successive exercises the ministry would take a decade no longer seven years to meet its debts and commitments You will understand Minister that given the low reliability of these ruin budgets and what the background inspires we are concerned about this prospect In programme 122 Bravo we have seen eight reprogrammings by agreement of the Council of Ministers which have caused delays in fourteen of the twenty one programmes in implementation and difficulties in financial and industrial planning for companies in the sector Does it not seem to you that it would be necessary at least to reach that long awaited minimum quota amortizing advances to release future resources I must remind you Minister that the general budgets of the State are a formal law that must be complied with and that the investment of public funds entails the responsibility and commitment that they reach their final destination without being worth technical or financial excuses Maritime patrol aviation and submarine weapon are sad examples of loss of capabilities due to obsolescence of a material that did not come to replace in time let 's hope it does n't happen the same Close your ears separatist ladies as they say with the innumerable F 35 Alpha and Bravo for the Air Force and the Navy respectively I have extended much perhaps too much as far as large investments are concerned because as you know there is no more ineffective expenditure than investment in systems that in the absence of staffing and support do not yield results in terms of the effectiveness of the forces the reason for being and the existence of the armies and the Navy We must denounce here that due attention to military personnel and effectiveness are the two major victims of the so called major programmes The military serve Spain with loyalty and professionalism that you abuse when the guarantor of your well being is the state How busy are they in aggravating the memory of their dead that they have no time to take care of the living How do you plan to secure the future of our soldiers and sailors beyond the age of forty five When does the department leave the equalization of the salaries of military personnel with the state security forces and bodies The salary increase to officials will not close that unfair gap On the other hand we see that the number of troops involved in operational activities continues to be reduced from 76,000 in 2021 to 54,000 by 2023 What is happening to the availability of human resources With regard to support programme 122 Alfa and Mike such a slight increase cannot alleviate the effects of repeated cuts in the maintenance of systems ships and aircraft having reached a maximum of 50 coverage of needs As the availability of material although scarce is compatible with limited deployment in times of peace the deficit is masked But how can you continue to spread crediblely in the face of threats against our vital interests being so under enlistment for the action of all forces We shall vote against section 14 Madam Minister precisely because of a sense of state"
"With all due respect Madam President Ladies and gentlemen the analysis of this section shows in particular that these ruin budgets are a disaster that has no possible arrangement and that only an amendment to the whole and a return to the government would be made Today groups which have tabled amendments to the joint text add up to their thousands of vetoes and none of them complain but the sectarianism of this Government is total it has proved it over and over again I do not know what answer this Government expects Ladies and gentlemen this government wants us all to participate in a paripé when in reality these budgets are already tied and cooked between socialists communists separatists and heirs of the ETA environment Today the news is known that the Government has surrendered to Bildu and will remove the Civil Guard from the Navarra roads To that a few minutes ago a spokesman for the Socialist Party called it institutional normality These budgets are the result of undesirable pacts for personal and party interests What interests Don Pedro Sánchez 's interest in staying in his chair the interest of the deputies of these groups who support him and his political clientele in order to continue living from the harshness of public money the interest of separatist coupism in avoiding the sentences handed down by the courts In short these budgets of ruin are the result of dealings between the left and the separatists who will end up paying the Spanish with their freedom and economy But let 's look at some points of interest in this section in these few minutes Unemployment By 2022 the general budgets expected that gross domestic product would grow by 6 and a budget of more than EUR 22.4 billion for unemployment was envisaged for SEPE Well we 're going to end up growing in 2022 instead of the 6 that was estimated a maximum of 2 after the slowdown of the economy in the third quarter Now the budgets for the year 2023 have been achieved with an estimated growth of 2.1 when we already know that we are going to decrease in the first two quarters and even in the third If we do not grow by more than 2 we know that jobs are being destroyed in the country However with an economy growing less than in 2022 unemployment is expected to fall by 5.3 There are 1179 million less budgeted and let us also remember that we have 920 000 fixed breaks which although they do not count in unemployment statistics do count for unemployment benefits In short the Socialist Government removes money from unemployment knowing that it will need it later through transfers appearing a false reality and hiding the real needs of unemployment expenditure With regard to self employment the Government had had no choice but to recognize in the budgets that there would be a serious fall in self employment With the self employed they do the opposite and the programme of economic benefits for the cessation of activity of self employed workers increases by 207 Already the amount budgeted in the previous year was such that it required subsequent transfers to try to reach all claimants In short it is recognized by the Government of the nation that it is going to be a very tough year for a column as fundamental to the national economy as the autonomous are And to this we add the treatment to young people young people are abandoned While Spain leads the highest youth unemployment rate in the European Union the OECD or the euro area money invested in youth employability will be lower the Youth Employment Programme will be cut by 39 and the Digital Skills for Youth Employment and Employment Promotion Programme will be abolished In short they are budgets that in this section show a clear sectarianism and a clear clientelism There is a 15 increase in advisory expenditure to the Government in social economic and labour matters more expenditure on advisers even more so when we have almost 3 million unemployed in Spain in addition to the 920,000 discontinuous workers who are ultimately temporary workers The costs for trade unions and employers of course and the transfer of real estate to these bodies do not fall they are EUR 40 million intended among other things to keep trade unions quiet Meanwhile funds are allocated to ideological programmes disguised as green transformation or support to LGTB collectives In short more political clientelism International bodies no longer hide that if the European economy goes into recession Spain will suffer the worst consequences These budgets are based on wrong estimates They are a disguise that seeks to hide harmful management and truly undesirable pacts and as we have already said in relation to the Employment Act this Ministry of Labour and Social Economy actually remains as the mere ministry of unemployment It is no more than that a ministry of unemployment because this government has already given up developing policies for the creation of stable and quality jobs and it only remains to manage and above all to make up the figures of chronic unemployment and of a labour market that increasingly offers worse conditions to workers in Spain These ruin budgets are an instrument of more than one illegitimate Government for perpetuating itself in power From VOX we commit ourselves to rebuilding everything that this government destroys and call on the unity of all Spaniards to regain the freedom and prosperity of the nation Thank you very much"
With venial Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen Eurojust is indeed an agency that allows us to fight effectively against organised cross border crime and every time its results are analysed its usefulness becomes more evident The recent Eurojust reports and the European Parliament 's last budgetary control report show us their intense activity I would like to make it clear to you that from such reports there is a great deal of emphasis on the mention of the fight against criminal illegal immigrant trafficking organizations It is a matter that not only concerns us with the security of our streets and the exploitation and risk of vulnerable people because already in 2015 Eurojust warned us of the entry of radical Islamists through these Mafia networks To suppress these illegal immigration mafias in recent years Eurojust 's operations have been greatly intensified and some of them with detainees in Spain In this regard it is curious that in 2016 the PSOE strongly criticized the then government for the lack of police action he said in Spain against this type of mafia and however on questions from the VOX Group the government has acknowledged that during this socialist government the number of organizations and of this type of mafia operating in Spain has doubled This demonstrates the inconsistency of the socialist government and that we should not just adapt this regulation to Spanish legislation but should be providing the police with means and abandoning these policies with so called effect that these mafias are so much profited by Secondly I would like to mention that the text that is being produced today envisages that both the Spanish national member and deputy and assistant in Eurojust will be members of the judicial or prosecutorial career We believe that they are the best possible professionals for these types of posts and we cannot agree with the amendment by Citizens which opens the door to the integration of other types of officials We have magnificent judges and prosecutors and although political power has been mistreating both the judicial and fiscal careers by pressing for their political control appointing a socialist minister as a prosecutor general doing everything possible in the end to control politically the organs of the judiciary despite all this judges and prosecutors have remained loyal to their duty and spare no effort in law enforcement Without doubt they are the ones who can offer us the best guarantees of professionalism and effectiveness Finally I believe that this law will be adopted with the virtually unanimous support of the House When this happens it is customary to hear from the Government or the Socialist Group some self praising for consensus in the vote Indeed it has already happened in some other initiative that a majority vote is used by the Government to appear to the gallery a certain will towards political consensus But let us not be fooled this type of technical legislation is supported by common sense and not by consensus and this Government however much it says or presumes does not know what consensus is This Government and the political groups that support it from what they do know are political marketing which is very different from consensus They have left us with evidence over and over again because consensus is not to exchange pardons for coup criminals in exchange for parliamentary support that is political marketing Consensus is not to water a communist ministry with millions of euros from all Spaniards to keep a few more months in power Nor is it consensus to promise to reform the charter the crime of sedition or the division of members of the General Council of the Judiciary between political groups or to look elsewhere while the law is being breached in Catalonia or to access absurd laws that run counter to common sense all in exchange for power to remain in power That 's not consensus that 's marketing that 's deal We do n't have rulers we have traffickers There is consensus when different groups direct their talks towards the general interest for the good of Spain not when the purpose is the personal interest the partyist the power for power and the regret of this political marketing in which the Government has settled the Spanish end up paying for it with their freedom and economy Thank you very much
With venial Mr. President I want to start by talking first about ways Ladies and gentlemen the Socialist Group obtained a majority in the last elections and is the largest group with one hundred and twenty Members That majority got it with deceit and false promises but it got it and the exercise of that majority is a responsibility However since the beginning of the parliamentary term from minute one the attitude towards the VOX Group has been to systematically reject our initiatives and amendments even if they were of obvious and palmary common sense and in the processing of this law it has been no different That attitude only denotes pride in the exercise of that majority an absolute lack of humility which then brings the problems that it brings and that we have all been able to verify Listening and reasoning is not bad it not only harms the legislative process itself the law itself but binds them to sectarianism The first thing the Socialist Group should be interested in is therefore a minimum of humility in the exercise of that responsibility Ladies and gentlemen in dealing with the Fisheries Act the first thing we must consider is that fisheries resources are public resources and therefore belong to all Spaniards without distinction of regions or any other similar consideration Its regulation and management must therefore respond to the national interest and equality of all Spaniards The law and its development must respond to a national fisheries strategy and policy in which Spain 's interests prevail over partisan regionalist interests or the interests of specific business sectors The autonomous system involves a waste of energy and resources seventeen autonomous communities producing a multitude of disparate regulations and seventeen administrations demanding competences taxes and maintaining an unusual political class with their corresponding clientele and servitudes this is joined by the perverse claim of regionalist privileges This reality translates into inequalities between Spaniards from both regions and these inequalities can also be reflected in this area in fisheries That is why with our amendments we seek to deepen the need to eliminate existing imbalances and differences between vessels and fishermen based solely on regional criteria All Spaniards are equal and we must start from that equality when considering the rights to fisheries resources Regionalist privileges must disappear Furthermore it is not reasonable that the consultation required of the Autonomous Communities has been increased to at least 30 different situations in this Act What must prevail is consultation with the sector concerned On the other hand a genuine national fisheries policy is incompatible with the submission of an 2030 Agenda and the reports of a group of supposed experts on climate change because these globalist agendas do not have a realistic plan for our fisheries sector and their decisions are taken from the backs of the Spanish and in particular from the backs of the fisheries sector our fishermen Curiously not long ago the minister himself Mr Planas regretted that the European Commission closed eighty seven areas for fishing wrongly and without taking into account any up to date scientific information or as the minister said the economic and social consequences of this measure he said so before opening the National Assembly of Fishermen 's Brotherhoods That is precisely one of the criteria that our group has taken into account in drawing up our amendment and which surprisingly we have seen in the words of the minister himself This is our amendment to Article 4 which the Socialist Group has however rejected The precautionary principle is useful if applied proportionally and taking into account the economic and social consequences and that is the objective of the amendment It is absolutely necessary to highlight in the law the social and economic benefits of fishing activity as guiding principles We believe that it is in the national interest to give special support to two key sectors of the population on the one hand small scale fishing small scale fishing and on the other hand young people We have already talked here about the minor arts or artisanal fishing which generates employment quality employment and which generates above all important economic activity on the coast and which stands out for its contribution to the national gross domestic product In our amendments we also insist on supporting young people on the need to facilitate their incorporation into fishing activity on the conviction that we must ensure generational relevancy and safeguard the continuity of the Spanish fishing sector which is the first in the European Union with more than 8700 vessels Young people and equality are the principles that are upheld in our amendments to article 40 which seek to shield the principle of support for young people by law The reserves should have remained at 10 It makes no sense that it was reduced in the parliamentary procedure to 5 We argue that these reserves apply precisely to those possibilities of support for youth and generational relief which can also be used to compensate for imbalances in the current distribution between ships and regions We cannot agree with the text that has been given to the fourth additional provision to which the Basque Group referred The text initially made it clear that the distributions
As I said to them the text initially made it clear that the distributions of pre-law fishing opportunities could be modified by reason of the new regulation and it was logical because that was the principle of equality that I told them at the beginning However the Socialist Group 's members have yielded to the Basque Group 's claims and the validity of the previous allocations will not be affected by the entry into force of this law This text will certainly give rise to problems not only in its application but also in its interpretation In short ladies and gentlemen whatever the case this law establishes a basis including nothing but sixteen express development permits and a generic one to develop it by royal decree We can only urge the ministry not to stop listening to fishermen to remember that all Spaniards are equal and not to forget the social and economic benefits of the fisheries sector equality young people and help with artisanal fishing Let 's give them a break and fight to shield criteria of distribution that allow them to sustain their ships and their families Thank you very much
Thank you very much Madam President Minister ladies and gentlemen one more year we find ourselves again in the analysis of these budgets for Agriculture Fisheries and Food which change very little year after year and the change is always worse Two years ago we talked about the difficult situation for the agricultural sector in the face of the crisis of COVID last year the beginning of inflation and the unusual rise in production costs and this year the global instability caused by the war in Ukraine and an eco-radical CAP and the ruin that you all approved in Brussels against common sense Minister the Spanish are starving inflation has reduced the purchase of fresh food by 57 and many farmers farmers and fishermen are in ruins How is it possible that the ministry of the things of eating is the one that has least increased the item in these budgets Why do you think he 's here Precisely so that the agri food sector suffers as little as possible in these very negative circumstances you are here at the head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Spain to defend the agricultural and food sector in Spain to prevent the ruin of farmers farmers and fishermen and to ensure that no one in Spain goes hungry You understand that do n't you It 's very easy to understand You are here precisely to cushion all these negative circumstances not to serve you as an excuse You have not been able to negotiate with your government colleagues more than an increase of 0.3 That is all Minister 0.3 This contrasts with the huge increases in the budget of other ministries such as the Ecological Transition the 2030 Agenda Consumption or Equality i.e. ideology Those are the issues that we see that this Government is increasing it is the ideology that matters to this Government Agriculture Fisheries and Food is the portfolio that loses the most with 16.2 less leaving the state 's contribution yes Minister in 1185 million euros We already knew that this government cares more about demagogy than about eating they care more about climate fanaticism than about farmers they care about animalism more than about cattle farmers they care more about the Green Pact than about fishermen they care more about the 2030 Agenda than about our rural world Year after year we see in the budgets of Agriculture Fisheries and Food their lack of interest in food sovereignty There are 15 ministries with budgets above the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food This year again 88 of the resources of this budgetary policy come from European funds Again this year the State is making a difference in the co-financing of EAFRD funds for rural development Mr Minister there is room for the state to contribute extraordinary money because it is a fund that was used to increase the competitiveness of the agricultural sector to sustainably manage natural resources and climate action that climate you are talking about all the time or to achieve a balanced territorial development of rural economies and communities in the face of an alarming situation of depopulation in our rural Spain A strategic sector for the economy of this country and for our sovereignty such as the national agri-food sector which accounts for 10 of Spain 's gross domestic product is settled with 1.8 of the total budget allocated by the Government for all ministries We do n't give credit Mr Minister the agricultural sector is going through a very difficult situation of which you are aware suffering from a very severe drought which has reduced production an insurmountable increase in energy production costs fuels seeds fertilizers fertilizers unfair competition from products coming from outside Europe the consequences of the war in Ukraine which have become evident in the sector and which you have previously spoken about in your intervention and with prices at source which do not compensate for the costs of production All of this makes the budget proposed by his ministry ridiculous Minister what needs to be done is to give direct aid to the agricultural and livestock sectors most affected by the crisis Tax measures should be taken to reduce agricultural gas oil fertilizers and plastics in the IRPF You fill your mouth with climate emergency but do not apply this climate catastrophe when it comes to compensating those who really suffer damage from drought fires or hail which are farmers The budget for the modernisation of irrigation as well as the new water infrastructures which are essential for this productive sector and which make it sustainable must be increased What happens is that what we see and what we already know is the commitment of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party to the water infrastructure you who are responsible for repealing the transfer of the Ebro by the votes of the Republican Left of Catalonia and who are right now throwing dams and water infrastructure The worst is yet to come because we must now implement this radical common agricultural policy which absolutely does not understand anyone in the agricultural sector with 40 of environmental conditions cut in amounts and aid We want to take this opportunity to show our support to the farmers who will protest tomorrow at this common agricultural policy of ruin in Madrid and will also do so on Saturday in Toledo With this CAP of ruin it could not be otherwise that the budgets of agriculture are rickish and useless for the sector a minimum contribution within general budgets which are the budgets of the ruin of Spain Thank you very much
Thank you very much Mr President Ladies and gentlemen we have come to debate in this plenary a non-legislative proposal on the abolition of Minister Garzón 's Ministry of Consumer Affairs To this end it is proposed to amend the relevant royal decrees in relation to the ministerial organizational structure that underpins this Government The VOX Parliamentary Group does not want to reduce this initiative to a ministry and we have proposed an amendment for a drastic reduction of the mastodontic structure of ministries so that almost half of them are eliminated and thus set an example of reducing public spending and efficiency In particular we demanded the elimination of three of the four vice presidencies and ten of the twenty two ministries so that the new structure of the Government would move from twenty three people to thirteen with the president at its head The oversized structure of the Government accounts for a minimum cost of almost EUR 16 million per year only in high ranking salaries We want Spain to stop having the government with more ministries in the European Union However despite considering this initiative by the People 's Parliamentary Group to be insufficient it should be noted that this proposal focuses on the Ministry of Consumer Affairs in the context of the entrepreneurial statements of Minister Garzón attacking livestock the meat sector and the quality of our exports He is a minister who has previously attacked various economic sectors such as the toy industry the candy industry and the tourism sector or who pushes the Nutri Score label against our Mediterranean diet Garzón 's latest statements are a real attack by the Government of Spain on an agri -food sector that is very important to Spain 's national interest As I said in the Permanent Chamber there is no justification for these statements by Garzón even though the consensus media have tried to whiten them What a Spanish minister can never do is make absolutely false statements abroad saying that our meat is of poor quality and that an industry in Spain is dedicated to contaminating soil and water and then exporting meat from abused animals declarations made in addition to a British newspaper financed by the powerful global animalist industry This government not only has an oversized structure with absurd ministries such as the one that governs the totalitarian communist Garzón which pays all Spaniards in the midst of a brutal crisis and which should of course be suppressed but every time they make statements of this kind they show that they are working against the interests of the Spanish people and our productive system This Government executes foreign dictates alien to our interests whether they be global social engineering agendas for the benefit of anti-national economic elites or the interests of that communist led international communism that infects the entire Iberian sphere Elites and neocommunism reach out in forums such as Davos or in that globalist agenda the 2030 Agenda which wants to end meat consumption and which absurdly criminalizes farmers and livestock farmers saying that they are the cause of climate change and pollution an agenda that has been signed by consensus all the parties of this Congress all but VOX Your consensus is depopulation ruin corruption demographic winter lack of profitability and closure of farms as we are seeing in Castile and León where the agrarian weight is ten times above the national average Livestock and farmers are no longer able to cope with your constraints and production costs They 're mobilizing all over Spain The pressure we put them to is untenable as happened yesterday in Lorca Our solidarity with the national agricultural sector and our constant thanks for feeding the Spaniards It is necessary for the Spaniards to be aware that these herrings against livestock agriculture our gastronomy or against our productive system are false
Our only agenda is Spain
Minister do you count on labour reform with the support of the Spanish primary sector
Look lady antisocial minister and from the divine left this labor reformer approved by mistake and agreed by the class unions and the CEOE is a real hoax that would have to embarrass you those of the red flags This reform has turned its back on the national primary sector from its back on the Spanish countryside to favour the interests of others who are not precisely those of the popular classes leaving the agricultural sector behind abandoning those sectors that depend on seasonality for recruitment The national primary sector is always the one that suffers in its labor negotiations its trade wars its cuts in the common agricultural policy its free trade agreements its globalist agendas its climate pacts its animal welfare laws its criminalizations and its radical ideological attacks its restrictions on irrigation its actions sanctions and conditionalities With this reform the contract of work or service determined is abolished Unforeseeable circumstances of production in contracts reduce chaining periods and increase penalties and penalties The eventual worker is the backbone of agricultural employment Most contracts in the field are field contracts The cost is going to be even higher for farms with this labour reform From fuels to feed through light fertilizers or fertilizers the countryside has experienced unprecedented price escalation For this reason the countryside is standing in all the towns and cities of Spain That 's why VOX is with them that 's why we will be with them on March 20 in the great manifestation of the agricultural and rural world in Madrid The rural world is rebelling against the defiance of its Government and this reform is a defiance in addition to a genuine hypocrisy that will be realized by all its voters who voted for them theoretically because they defended social justice I repeat hypocrisy
Yes I 'm done Madam President which is only Spain and that 's why we 're here Thank you very much
With venial Mr. President A father who asks for permanent imprisonment for a criminal who has raped and murdered his daughter is not seeking revenge is asking for justice Revenge would be raping and killing the criminal 's daughter Ladies and gentlemen how many more children do we have to lose at the hands of monsters in order for you to react at once How many predators how many monsters are going to continue to allow them to take advantage of a crack in the system to rip out an innocent child or a young woman with a lifetime in front of her parents arms How many mothers how many parents are you the Legislature going to continue to sentence the life sentence that means knowing that your daughter has spent the last moments of her life raped by a recidivist killer These and not others are the questions that all of you are going to have to answer today with your vote each and every one of you because what we are discussing today in this session is the extension of the permanent prison reviewable to two concrete assumptions the murder with concealment of the body and the recidivism of the murder Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party and ladies and gentlemen of the United Nations We can today from this rostrum on behalf of the VOX Group demand a public commitment to the parents present here and to all the parents of the murdered children that they are not only going to make a paripe vote today in favour of taking this law into consideration but that they are not going to go to the fraudulent subterfuge to use their majority in the Bureau of the House to extend the deadline for the processing of amendments so that this urgent reform does not see the light I demand a public commitment This reform was introduced in 2015 alone with the absolute majority of the People 's Party And I tell you loud and clear ladies and gentlemen on behalf of VOX that it is an insufficient reform and that it has arrived very late How is it possible that since 1995 which is the date of adoption of our current Penal Code until 2015 the Penal Code will be reformed up to twenty times and you do not react before introducing an absolutely necessary penalty for these predators for these monsters With a minimum of knowledge of criminal policy it is known that they are not reinsertible that they cannot be reinserted into society as if they were not playing all of you politicians a macabre Russian roulette with the lives of our children who are the ones who put themselves at risk when they allow you to see the light of the sun in freedom recidivist killers authentic monsters who stalk our children in the shadows If you do not recognise that the second murder is a failure of the system we are doomed to repeat the rulings and here you have three families who have paid with their children 's lives for not reacting in time as shown by the fact that today we are debating an extension of the 2015 reform to those two concrete assumptions Make it very clear that if the president of the government Mariano Rajoy in 2010 stated that there was no need to be afraid of a debate on life imprisonment today only VOX defends that life imprisonment for the most execrable crimes and it will be the legislative reform that we introduce in Spain when the Spaniards give us enough confidence From 2015 until March 2022 up to thirty four people have been sentenced to a reviewable prison sentence David Oubel sentenced in 2017 for murdering his two minor daughters Sergio Díaz killed his disabled grandfather Daniel Montaño murdered a seventeen month old girl Marcos Miras murdered his eleven year old son and thus up to thirty four sentenced to permanent imprisonment In 2015 all Members of this House except the People 's Party voted in favour of these monsters leaving prison once they had served the maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years and were able to enjoy prison permits much earlier as is currently possible through permanent prison after the eight year term I have come to the Journals of Sessions of this House specifically to the Journal of Sessions dated 15 January 2015 to find out what were the reasons that led them not to support a punitive measure that is absolutely necessary with a minimum non-sectarian knowledge of criminal policy Do you know what he said for example Republican Left at that time Joint Group through his spokesman Joan Tardà That there are more punishments that are harder will not protect the victims any more or better They have repeated it again in this House today Tell that to Laura Luelmo's mother the twenty six year old girl who was savagely assaulted and murdered in El Campillo by a monster only two months after she left prison where she had served a twenty year sentence for murdering an elderly woman Tell that to Alex 's mother the nine year old boy killed in Lardero by a monster only once and a half after leaving prison where he had served twenty years in prison for sexual assault murder and child abuse Of course higher penalties reduce crime If those two monsters to quote just two examples would have been in prison Laura and Alex today would be alive But if we as legislators do not see in that second murder a failure of the system I repeat that we are doomed to repeat the failures that enclose in the lives of the people we lose Left Republican the Socialist Party and today United We can qualify the reform of our criminal law that introduced permanent prison reviewable as punitive populism Tell that to the three families who are here today who are the architects of the reform that we are debating today
and that they are suffering I conclude Mr President the real life imprisonment the death in life that in two of the cases implies the taking of thirteen years and two years and four months looking for the corpse of their daughters in order to be able to bury them and begin their mourning
With all due respect Madam President Minister in order to have a problem with the Constitution I recommend that you not miss the appearance that in a couple of hours I will make before the Constitutional Court to announce the appeal number 33 of VOX before the High Court because in something affects you In 1988 Nicolás Redondo being secretary general of UGT led a general strike against the socio-economic policy of the socialist government of Felipe González eight million workers seconded it and that general strike paralyzed Spain Today with the price of electricity at 700 euros the megawatt hour with the price of gasoline at two euros per litre and with the price of the shopping basket 30 more expensive than just a year ago the workers wonder where are the UGT class unions and Workers Commissions because the last time we saw them on the streets was precisely the 8th of January to demand the rapprochement and release of the prisoners etarras and today we will again see them on the streets of Catalonia to protest against the constitutional requirement of 25 Spanish education in this autonomous community While in France over the past two years there have been up to nine general strikes in Spain a Communist Labour Minister has tried to rob the people of their right to protest by bribed class unions with up to 87 million euros in the last decade 56 increase since you Lady Unemployed are Communist Labour Minister and just a few days ago the last 17 million euros But hey do n't tell our communist labor minister that he bribed class unions to turn them into personal platforms because it offends us Well the last betrayal of these class unions we have seen on the occasion of the mobilization of the general strike called by our transporters to which UGT and Workers Commissions have again aligned themselves with the Government of Spain to demand that it be repressed harshly First they said the strike was a bull communist minister then they said there were four when the Spaniards saw the images of thousands of trucks protesting against the rise in prices they already pulled the wild from the far right the truckers were VOX and they were Putin and the last justification for trying to delegitimize them is that they were trying to destabilize the government Listen to me members of the Government of Spain They are not terrorists they are carriers and they have the absolute support of the Spanish Go on You 've lost the streets
"With all due respect Madam President Single parent families i.e. those in which only the father or mother lives with the minor children in his care are a reality in Spain In fact this reality accounts for 10 of the total Spanish households If we go to the latest updated data available to us we find that in 2020 according to the National Institute of Statistics there are a total of 1,944,800 single parent households in Spain Faced with the manipulations that some groups have again poured on our formation during the debate of this parliamentary initiative listen to me well ladies and gentlemen because you have to give it all very chewed single parent families are families and as such have to be protected by the protection provided for in Article 39 of the Spanish Constitution when it provides for the obligation of the public authorities to ensure the social economic and legal protection of families The proposal for a law which we are debating today addresses a problem claimed by single parents in Spain in the light of the situation of obvious inequality in which children who only have a father or a mother under the current regulation of the system of paternity and maternity leave by childbirth or adoption because the current regulation establishing both the Workers Statute and the Basic Staff Regulations is the truth that ignores the peculiarities of single parents families At present both legislative texts recognize the right of the father and mother where both exist to a leave of sixteen weeks after delivery or adoption six of which must be immediately after these two moments allowing the remaining weeks to be requested by the parents in succession This situation leads us as I have indicated to a situation of obvious inequality from the moment when the minor child who after childbirth or adoption has only one of our parents can enjoy his or her dedication and care after the weeks following the birth for a total of sixteen weeks compared to the twenty six weeks enjoyed by the children who have his or her father and mother with them which puts single parents in a clear situation of disadvantage compared to the minor who does have both parents The best interests of the child require that both situations be matched by justice equity and constitutional mandate because this is also provided for in article 39 of our fundamental text in its second paragraph which I mentioned earlier when it points out the obligation of the public authorities to ensure the full protection of children equal before the law regardless of their filiation In this case it has been the courts as previously pointed out that have been before the legislator since the judgement of 6 October 2020 of the TSJ of the Basque Country the Chamber of Social Affairs in which the right of a single parent mother to enjoy the extended permit which would have corresponded to the two parents if they were to have them has been recognized for the first time for the minor children who gave rise to the request But it is necessary not to force our judges to act as legislators We therefore anticipate that this parliamentary group of course will support the adoption of the bill that has been registered by the People 's Parliamentary Group However limiting the protection of single parent families to this extension of maternity or paternity leave by childbirth or adoption is clearly insufficient That is why we also announce that we will proceed with the improvement and refinement of the text during the process of amendments As mentioned above there are almost 2 million single parent families eight out of ten headed by mothers by women This objective fact should not however lead us to fall into the terminological ignorance which is usual on the left which proposes the replacement of the term single parent family by single parent family or grandparent family when the adult in charge of the minor children is the mother And this is because this terminological error comes from considering that single parent has its origin as a father when the parent does come from a relative which of course can include a father or a mother This terminological ignorance of which the representative of Podemos has again demonstrated today to whom by the way we have seen tremendously revolutionary displaying their flags Who was a member of the Government of Spain in order to divide and bring down the Government that has unilaterally changed Spain 's position on Western Sahara We also need to bear in mind that we must reject the discriminatory exclusion advocated by some groups when identifying single parents exclusively with single mothers and advocating exclusive protection from single mothers because it is clear that a single mother living with her partner with whom she has children in common is not a single parent In fact if this confusion and equality were allowed it would turn out that of the nearly 2 million single parent families that we had in Spain in 2020 the largest group would be excluded which are the widows 724,100 single parent families in which because of the marital status of the parent they are widows We will improve the text they have submitted by means of amendments because it is clear that single parent families according to statistical data are in a situation of greater vulnerability and more difficult access to reconciliation of work and family life It is also clear that limiting the rule to extend the permit to twenty six weeks leads the father or mother who enjoys it to a situation of possible and actual exclusion from employability because not all companies can take charge of a leave for twenty six weeks of the same person The most important thing ladies and gentlemen is that this initiative again does not represent a decisive commitment to the protection of families The objective is that in Spain we allocate only 1.3 of GDP to the social protection of families and children The family is the absolute basis of society prior to the State Strong families make strong societies without families there will be no nation there will be no Spain And the solution to this demographic desert that you all of you have imposed on Spain is not illegal immigration which leads to a population replacement and the disappearance of the nation but the protection of the family and the promotion of birth because 47 million Moroccans in Spain do not make Spain do Morocco The reality is that today in Spain it is a real rebellion to defend the family because its policies contract to a criminalization of one of the two members that are essential for the youngest children especially the father I do n't want to be like my dad when I 'm older This poster could pass through one of you in an institutional campaign on the day of the so called gender violence but the reality is that it is a poster of the People 's Party and Citizens Party exhibited in the city of Córdoba in November 2020 Faced with this VOX puts the family as a fundamental axis"
"With venial Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon Let me start with a brief context On October 1 2020 as the president pointed out is the date when the one known as the Kitchen Research Commission was set up At that time we had been fighting the pandemic for seven months Outside these privileged walls the Spanish people suffered We had thousands of missing companies thousands of jobs destroyed because this government with the majority support of this House decided to ban working for the Spaniards without approving in parallel a fair compensation plan for all the Spaniards who had been banned from working and bringing bread to their homes Three months of house arrest under an unconstitutional state of alarm according to the High Court thanks to the estimation of VOX 's appeal Not to mention the more than 100,000 Spaniards who have lost their lives throughout this pandemic 100,000 Spaniards who are not recognized as victims by this government but have been hidden and continue to be hidden under unworthy propaganda Well after seven months of deep suffering for the Spanish people we have that the Socialist Party and the United Nations We can use their parliamentary force to reject VOX 's requests for the purpose of setting up in this Congress commissions of inquiry concerning the acquisition of sanitary material During those months more than EUR 1 billion were awarded by way of emergency We asked for a commission of inquiry into the deaths in the homes of elderly people after meeting in this Congress in this House through the president of the bosses of the residences of elderly people who when under the command of Mr. PabloIglesias and the residences of elderly people asked for medicine what they sent to them was morphine And they rejected a commission of inquiry We call for a Commission of Inquiry into the management of the Government during all these months which would have enabled us to draw lessons from the actions carried out and better prepare ourselves for the event that we have to face another emergency tomorrow All of this was prevented by this parliamentary union between the Socialist Party and the United Podemos But what 's more if your interest was to carry out an investigation into something that had nothing to do with the fight against the pandemic which at the time October 2020 we were carrying out why they also refused VOX 's request to carry out a Commission of Inquiry into the illegal financing of the United Nations We can come from narco dictatorships When we were talking about imputing a party to the coalition government No they decided 206 votes in this House that we should carry out a commission of inquiry in an unprecedented way in the history of Spanish parliamentarianism into events that occurred in 2013 and 2014 the one known as Operation Kitchen which had the purpose in an unprecedented way I repeat because it was facts that had allegedly occurred in a past legislature to investigate whether under the government of the Popular Party of Mariano Rajoy reserved funds and other resources of the Ministry of the Interior and other public institutions had been used criminally in order to remove incriminating evidence from the People 's Party and alleged senior leaders in the judicial investigation by the alleged caisse B From that party We have devoted 20 Members and two Members of this House to this for just over a year But it turns out that after embarking on this barren adventure they wanted a controlled blast because when we asked for obviously relevant testimonies in that Commission starting with Mr Villarejo himself Socialist Party and United Podemos opposed VOX had to travel to the prison to gather Mr. Villarejo 's testimony and be able to offer it later on in the Commission of Inquiry That 's the only way we can twist our arm As they have opposed appearing on the Kitchen Soraya Sáenz Commission of Inquiry in Santamaría who was Vice President of the Government under Rajoy 's mandate and the former Director of the National Intelligence Centre Mr. Sanz Roldán As Mrs Dolores Delgado and the prosecutor Ignacio Stampa have opposed the appearance in this House with regard to whom it is now being investigated whether it was tortically removed by its public prosecutor to torpedo precisely the investigation being carried out at the National Court of the known as Operation Kitchen And today we know precisely that an association of prosecutors will bring Dolores Delgado to justice for preventing access to the file of prosecutor Ignacio Stampa The reality is that as VOX said on 1 October 2020 this Commission has been absolutely barbarous for a reason of pure logic and that an investigation was being conducted in parallel for the same facts before the National Court which believe me I who have acceded to the judicial proceedings I have described as a genuine film of terror but it is clear that the most interesting witnesses for the relevance of their testimony when they come to this Parliamentary Commission would refuse to declare because they thus assist their constitutional right of defence It is clear that when we complete the judicial documentation of interest to shed light on these serious facts we would be denied due to the reservation of judicial cases But listen Socialist Party you dare to say in an opinion that there are certain criminal officials here and you point to Mr Mariano Rajoy and Mrs Dolores de Cospedal Ladies and gentlemen of Citizens but how dare you do the same in this House and in this rostrum and now explain to me why you have not mentioned Mrs Soraya Sáenz of Santamaría Why has the investigation and alleged involvement of the National Intelligence Centre in the serious facts being investigated by the National High Court been avoided in this Commission and we too were supposed to be prevented not through a controlled blast We ask you to vote for the particular vote that this group has put forward and that it intends to make improvements so that public resources are not lost again in actions as sterile as this Committee of Inquiry and because moreover the opinion that you are expected to adopt the one promoted by the Socialist Party has a clear unconstitutionality for violation of fundamental rights"
"Dear Minister reflect yourself in the mirror of the ten data I 'm going to give you It is 443 square meters of the official housing you occupy as minister by the way the largest of the twenty two ministries which for that you are a good communist They are zero euros that you pay per month for the service water light gas and heating of your 443 square meters of official housing It is 700 euros the megawatt hour historical record of the bill of light that yesterday we paid the rest of the Spaniards 700 euros just a year ago the price of light was at 49 euros and it was already expensive The price of gasoline is 2 euros litre It is 24 months that the offices of SEPE the former INEM which depend on you have closed to the public if not by prior appointment it is a real miracle to be able to consume There are 927,500 long term unemployed in Spain today 300,000 more than before the pandemic only in Spain do we have more long term unemployed than seventeen European Union countries together The total number of unemployed in Spain today is 3,111,684 the highest unemployment rate in the eurozone the OECD and the European Union is in Spain 13 It is 17 million euros that yesterday while the Spaniards paid 700 euros the light less you granted the Council of Ministers to the trade unions It is 87 million euros that UGT and the Workers Commissions the class unions have received in the last decade 57 more since you are minister 2012 was the last year in which a general strike was called in Spain although in fact there were two in that year one in March to protest against the labor reform approved by the People 's Government and another in November against measures to reduce the public deficit With this data which is yours lady unemployed communist minister we have class unions that have become real personal platforms of yours Nine years without social mobilizations In France only in the last two years there have been twelve general strikes We announced as my president Santiago Abascal did yesterday that next March 19th it will be VOX together with Solidarity who brings the Spaniards to the street"
With all due respect Madam President Minister I do n't know what might have happened to her Have you given him time to read the question posed to him by Mr. Theodoro García Aegean Because I was asking him about the agricultural sector and he has n't devoted a single word to the countryside Just a few days ago you were saying in statements to the media regarding your Government and believe me minister they are literal words of yours that this Government does very chulsy things and we are not able to communicate them Now answer VOX how would this job reform benefit the Spanish agricultural sector
"Thank you Madam President Communist minister not content with criminalizing the Spanish primary sector by treating our farmers and farmers as genuine criminals by false accusations of slavery and violation of labour rights not content with accusing our farmers and farmers of being the culprits of their ideological climate emergency when one hour of that Falcon that military official plane that you personally like to use for private trips to the Vatican produces more emissions than 16,000 cows in our fields not content with it now this government is taking another blow to the Spanish primary sector by imposing a change of recruitment model that does not take into account the specificities and regime specific to the Spanish agricultural sector This planned labour reform minister has been done behind the back of the countryside Listen to me well temporality is intrinsic to the Spanish agricultural sector which does not mean precariousness but as the closest you have been to the field is to the supermarket chain or to play golf and continues to think that lettuces grow in stock we have lady unemployed which with almost 117,000 livestock and agricultural farms will generate the loss of thousands of agricultural jobs I 'll tell you next February 16th from Murcia at the tractor station where I 'll be present as I did last week in Salamanca Listen to us well communist minister because you are not going to win the pulse of the Spanish rural world"
I also bring a very nice book At first there was nothing and God Well I 'm not going to read them the whole book because I 'm sure they 'd give me exactly The same time as the other speaker I 'm sure Minister thank you very much for your presence Unfortunately I have to inform you because you have not followed the debate this morning which has been very intense and entertaining that I have declared myself this morning blue seat specifically in which you are Be careful not to declare that you are exercising gender based violence against a poor blue chair I 'm telling you for fun cause then they tell me I 'm really bad Those who are n't busy are these two and it goes on seats this They 're not here Are you hiding for some reason the two gentlemen who were yelling at a lady here yesterday No one has asked for forgiveness yet because yesterday they shouted from the Bureau of Congress to my partner Are you hiding them for some reason Have you asked for forgiveness yet Have you asked for forgiveness No no
You have freedom not like that gentleman who told me he had to take a nap Thank you so much You throw it away now that you can sleep now that you sleep with those who took the dream away from the lord of this other seat You 're taking naps I repeat one has the freedom to say what one thinks what one defends even if you are shouted fascist or Nazi Whatever That 's the freedom some of us have because at any time we can take that door and go to a full life like the one we had On the other hand some of you are trapped here by the arrangements and hooks you have with this gentuza I 'm on it Minister for you worse because you can pass us every day but with the cycle we have of changing ministers I would be with the face you have right now tense tense Because of course the expiration date is coming No you too sleep well by sleeping with the person who is sleeping with this Government Well perfect it 's reflected
I would n't stay calm when we 're talking about something as serious as 4040 million euros that the Spanish of all kinds and conditions generously contribute the rich the poor the mid-pensioners everyone contributes to the 4 billion We are being proposed here a bill to which we have already tabled an amendment to the whole of which was based on three or four things First of all we do not think that Spain 's sovereignty is being transferred to undefined third institutions This about global governance we do n't know who it is we do n't know who they have chosen we do n't know where they meet we do n't know who they serve exactly Secondly because of the emptiness of this law This law does not adequately regulate two issues the change of FONPRODE and how this money will be managed Thirdly for the duty of protection We are presenting an amendment as a whole I think it is still legal in this democracy to present an amendment as a whole and you have taken off with statements about this absolutely deplorable group We had this conversation and then you did n't want to give me a reply there you are with your political courage However the PNV also tabled an amendment in its entirety and did not tell them any of that How curious that the rules here are different depending on whether you are more friendly or more necessary This rule is not what it should have been Minister this rule does not focus on humanitarian aid and cooperation as it should have done Kabul September 2021 or in a few weeks probably on the border between Ukraine and Moldova or between Ukraine and Poland Because of the ideological priorities given to this law do you really believe that people were coming to Kabul or will they get to the border to try to catch the last plane with the notes of the last course of feminism Do you think that someone by collecting the last things in Lvov or in a small town in Ukraine is going to take the last book of the vulva self perception talk that might have given you Spanish cooperation Do you really believe that these are the priorities that Spain should have in the world in cooperation and in humanitarian aid Hunger thirst cold and education of truth the truth that of mathematics that of science that of history that of language That we should have been and should have been the priority of this law but no you prefer to hand over Spain and privatize because this privatizes An NGO does not cease to be a private entity You who have this aversion to the private decide that NGOs are not private they are something else they are kind of a strange hybrid No they 're private entities Look I 'm not disrespecting you They 're very laudable I love the private just like I love the public but this of some yes and however as has already been said close the door to companies If we are going to have to face hunger cold or lack of energy it turns out that we have Spanish companies some public companies that could be helping the cooperation to develop energy agriculture or water projects But no What a coincidence It is better to ideology and privatize that yes always for those closest to you Minister I do n't know if it 's settled if you sleep well I do not know whether this law meets the criteria of being at the service of Spain of its security of its citizenship of democracy based on the Constitution and not on the ideas of the part If it 's too simple We have a book that is the Constitution I am not going to read it calmly because I will not be given the two minutes that have been given to the previous speaker despite the interruptions I have had We base our cooperation on this in the defence of the Spanish Constitution If you want to cooperate with your ideas I invite you to fundraising and make the cooperation you want we can do so too because there is freedom But the public which is of all let us do what is of all which is the Constitution I 'm on my way Minister there is also the one with whom because you have fallen into decentralized cooperation which will bring inefficiency high risks for the cooperators themselves and above all nation risks because if the false Catalan embassies were already a risk for Spain
How late they 're giving it to Don Guillermo And look at you having good afternoons bad afternoons and even worse afternoons The truth is I 'm not going to join them because when someone wants to give everything I have empathy with him Even if you 've let go of some coz I 'm already empathized although there are evenings Do n't be afraid to look up because when you take out that citizen display you remind me of this beautiful dome and that folding up there that reminds a beautiful animal that is represented there we all do well and we 're so handsome They remind me of the animal that 's represented there Yeah yeah upstairs do n't you see The window Have you recognized the animal yet Don Guillermo we agree It says in the Constitution The law will regulate the organisation and parliamentary control and this is important of the media dependent on the state Right It 's as easy as that So is there a need for a law Yes the Constitution says so Is Spanish Television regulated Yeah Are they regulated and with parliamentary control which is what I would like to talk about today other means The answer is no no no and forty seven years no Because they are not subject to appearances for example You and I have shared appearances like that of the president of the EFE Agency who comes here almost to tell us that it is not a public medium and that we only pay her losses who come here when they are appointed and for budgets without knowing or how a result account works Gentlemen I would ask you please that when you choose people for important positions at least that you know how to make the first numbers you can do it in a Post It or if not we teach it to you like that minister in two afternoons Do n't worry we have very good people in right wing parliamentary groups to teach them So is the scope of this bill right No doubt he 's fine but he 's a long way to go He 's missing because we 've been celebrating Francoism for forty seven years here In the case of the EFE Agency you lords of the PSOE and also of the PP are taking part in the celebration of an agency founded by a certain Ramon Serrano Suñer the Brother in law You 're letting the EFE Agency work as it worked exactly during the franchise You hate it I know but it's in your interests for the EFE Agency to function as it did during the franchise at the service of the government I am not going to go into the details of when in the Commission a senator from the PSOE made us a proposal to pay tribute to the founding parents of Spanish Broadcasting He asked us to celebrate the founding of Radio Nacional de España in 1937 by Millán Astray and Spanish Television in 1956 by Arias Salgado without forgetting in 1938 the first tests with Telefunken in collaboration with the German Government You really do n't realize what you 're asking us to celebrate And the problem is that for forty seven years of celebrating Francoism and collaboration with Germany in 1938 you have forgotten to apply the Constitution to the EFE Agency and to many media dependent on public money So I 'm going to propose a solution Not only are we going to support this proposal do n't worry but we are going to discuss this law and then we can go into detail We are going to support it so that it can be processed in this Parliament in spite of the scratches it has given us some of them with a couple of lies but they have been tiny scratches because you can't really make big scratches For the fundamental problem there is a very rapid solution that we have already proposed in 2020 We proposed that the Spanish Radio television Control Commission will change its name and role to be a joint control commission for state owned media Cost to the taxpayer zero euros compliance with the Constitution 100 per cent We have not complied with the Constitution for forty seven years and this very afternoon if you would if you would and these others would we could do so I challenge them Do you want to comply with the Constitution yes or no Let 's do it in the next five minutes I challenge them to see if they have democratic courage With regard to the development of the law Mr Guillermo I am not going to give you lessons in liberalism but the law you have proposed is very unliberal we will talk about it we will make amendments to it First of all because you are not talking about what we should be talking about that we think it has to be a great project of what the State has to be dependent on at the service of the Spanish State probably more outward than it was doing inside In its wording I do not tell you that it is bad on the contrary it is well worked we think they focus too much on what there is and we understand that it is better something new plant than trying to build on that dirty ball than there is It is better to be able to build State dependent means reduced to their expression necessary to serve the State not to serve the state of political parties of these gentlemen of these gentlemen and their usual partners That 's what we should be doing and there despite the kicks that citizens hit us you will always have us by your side And by the way since we 're about to apply tomorrow we have a huge chance The minister of propaganda is coming here tomorrow and we 're going to talk to him about this too The message will be very simple gentlemen of the socialist government in collaboration with the quadruple P those who agreed the presidency People 's Party PSOE PNV and Podemos because you have said it very well and you are right not only did you oppose Citizens we too that we are a little bigger at this time than you and that we were also there you agreed to put your dirty hands on Spanish Television while shouting Independence independence independence That 's what you you you and you have done And on top of it they 've got frogs Let 's talk about it and tell the minister tomorrow Get your dirty hands off the information of all the Spaniards And I conclude Don Guillermo I had so much to give him and I have n't given him I had so much to tell him and we will do it in the course of this law but really you stop applying techniques as frank as those that made Serrano Suñer excited at the founding of the EFE Agency Let us control this very afternoon by changing the Spanish Television Control Commission to a public media control committee this very afternoon zero cost to start implementing the constitutional mandate that all public media should be owed to this Parliament to these Courts to give function to their public service and to really control that they serve the Spaniards and not to you to you to you or to you to the quadruple P or to your partners that I do not want or name Thank you so much Good afternoon
Madam President ladies and gentlemen I think it was necessary in the midst of this debate on international conventions that at least one voice will be raised in defence of the interests of Spain not the interests of those who want to break Spain and bring international agreements to talk about what interests them We are talking about very serious things that affect the Spaniards You do international politics and politics for the Spaniards Let 's make politics for the Spaniards with the international conventions We are talking about three airspace agreements in three places two of them in conflict we are talking about Armenia and Ukraine reached by the European Union and which Spain has to corroborate or not It seems reasonable that we recognize that the world of 2021 has changed What was a reasonable airspace agreement at the end of last year at this time is absolute madness Does this mean that we do not have to ratify these agreements with Ukraine Armenia and other countries No but we have to draw attention to the European Union because its slowness and delay in adopting agreements lead to the adoption at this time of an airspace agreement for the hope of peace in that territory in the conflict in Ukraine Let us hope that this agreement can be approved but that it will be kept because it would be absolutely unreasonable for Spanish airlines to fly for example in that territory at this time The second part concerns the classified information agreement with Azerbaijan a direct agreement between Spain and Azerbaijan also reached last year We are talking about one more of the inheritances of social communism in the world let us not forget These conflicts that I am talking about come from the legacy of the practical application of communism and socialism in the world That 's what these conflicts come from their perverse ideas And that 's why we 're going to oppose it because it 's a conflict that also affects the Spaniards There are already many problems with the Spanish with energy with arriving at the end of the month among others in many of us this government has put us with its irresponsible international actions so that now we start to do that international policy that likes so much the left those that break Spain seeking to bring examples other countries It 's complicated what 's in Azerbaijan right now it 's complicated what 's in Armenia We have religions we have ideas and we have the heritage of republics remember that you Soviets That is the origin of this problem the application of communism and socialism There was already an agreement here between all the groups to ask for international legality and Spain does not deserve to enter into a conflict right now which moreover affects energy which is what really affects the Spaniards you are full of mouths talking about it right now A little bit of responsibility a little bit of caution a little bit of caution and a little bit of thinking about Spain and the Spanish ladies and gentlemen Thank you very much
Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen this motion is understood very quickly by reading what the representatives of ERC have already said in the inquiry into which this motion is born The Republican Parliamentary Group agreed with its group the PSOE to withdraw the amendment to the entire 2022 General Budgets in exchange for the General Audiovisual Communication Act being negotiated and approved with the ERC independents This is blackmail This is another step in the ongoing and permanent blackmail of independence for all Spaniards And in this case with hostages the sector of independent production and the freedom of expression of the Spaniards on social networks where they manage to accumulate a little audience that disposes of the nerves to you to you and to the usual Those are the ones you have kidnapped and that is blackmail Because you and you PP and PSOE were portrayed in the famous law Because you want the duopoly the duopoly that 's got you caught up in the news And you the ERCs and the Independenceists want the tripoly What you want is a monopoly moreover local in your territory with the excuse of languages So do n't come here and defend the independent producers You only defend indepes producers which is a very different thing It 's a little painful it's a little painful because you 're still fooled by the tahur It is already very painful it is that they have already failed them in the Commission it is that they have failed them in the presentation it is that they have lied here in the parliamentary debate it is that they have lied to them in the Senate and here they come to crawl before Pedro Sánchez to say what about me Pedro give me the argo He 's not gonna give it to them What I should give them is shame Look if you 're gonna be blackmailers learn from the good guys The PNV can give you lessons which also support you with general state budgets that two days later stab you as Mr Rajoy knows Stabbed as the day after day by the duopoly of Atresmedia and Mediaset to the People 's Party who gives himself timid and handed himself over to that duopoly that he created and that he continues to be afraid of because he 's been caught up in the news and you 'll know what the news is Because these are the same producers who are going to make the sauna massage series to his holiness the same producers who also charge from Spanish Television They are the same ones that you have supported from the PP from the PSOE and those that you want to have exclusively in your territories which you intend to dominate Who pays for the duck Because what you put into that law is the limitation of the freedom of expression of Spanish people on social networks That 's what you you and you all together managed to get into that law But no one talked about it because we were left alone Look we have to defend freedom we have to avoid duopoly we have to eliminate the tripoly and monopoly that you want to have in your territories that you consider your own and above all we have to stop once and for all the propaganda of you of you and territorially of you that we pay all the Spaniards We 've got to get rid of that propaganda now That is why the VOX Parliamentary Group will now demand full and absolute transparency so that the Spanish know how much public money they receive from governments Let them declare let them be transparent and that when we open a newspaper let us watch a television or let us see a series let us know how much money you you or you have given them And above all I can tell you one thing Someday there will be a government with sufficient dignity and in that government there will be VOX or VOX will support it to repeal this audiovisual law which is all it does is hand over complete control of information and entertainment to the usual the duopoly and the indepe triopoly Someday we will repeal that law for that reason for the freedom of all Spaniards to receive information and entertainment free and created by independent producers And we will also repeal it because it goes against the freedom of those who manage to get some attention on social networks Because you 're already going against influencers against tickets or youtubers You know why Because they are not controlled by the duopoly because they are not controlled by the political duopoly nor by the media duopoly nor by the independenceist monopoly of blackmail and extortion Let the extortion end and let the freedom of expression of the Spaniards live
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen He 's still shaking with Mr. Mayoral I do n't know what to take but he 's excited Go for God with the demagogy that brings us to this Congress Thank you very much Mr. Mayoral I was coming with good intention because I was going to say how good is the left it 's very good the left is how to say it spectacular incredible wonderful funky great it 's good at one thing but quiet that I 'm not suddenly suffering a sudden conversion I 'm not falling off the horse on the way to Damascus and I 'm not going to speak in Latin although speaking of Spanish Radiotelevision one would have to swear in Aramaic but I have n't had a sudden conversion You are good at one thing because you can be carriers of some absolutely perverse ideas you can have the wrong ideas you can be deeply wrong and you can on top be destructive with everything you touch but you are good at one thing and I admit it propaganda You the left the independenceists are very good at propaganda I 'm really telling you I 'm telling you honestly And I recognize that capacity for the infection of that propaganda in everything they touch It 's infectious in the negative sense do n't come to me that I can keep telling you things It is infectious in negative dirty staining sometimes with the complicity of those who have frightened them I do not know why you have been afraid for so many decades some who once said to be conservative or liberal I do not understand because facing you is very simple with the word with the truth and putting you in front of the mirror of what you do For decades the fear of what they will publish has constrained the political decisions of some groups in this House The desire to go out on the cover of a medium progresses the weekend has led to sympathies and deliveries But I want to make one point for you you will be very good at propaganda but from three years to this part of this House there is a group that does not surrender there is a group that will not give up the arguments there is a group that will face you and that before the media controlled by the left and today we are talking about the public media we will be as uncomfortable as we can so that you have this cultural battle so fun because you were bored before we arrived A few days ago we questioned the minister of propaganda as well major plumber of the kingdom and asked him about independence about the impartiality of Spanish Radiotelevision and how he was going to keep it independent and impartial He did n't answer he put us down from a donkey let go of everything he could say We have data that up to four times has met the outgoing president of Spanish Radiotelevision Mr Pérez Tornero outgoing and hurtful in Moncloa with the Secretary of State for Communication A very simple question of cultural battalion does Spanish Radiotelevision depend on the State Secretariat of the Government of Spain The answer is no no no no no no no no no no no So four small meetings in Moncloa have made clear the interplay that you on the left have so that one of your propaganda axes is Spanish television And secret meetings also with the presidential candidate who the other day in parliamentary office was unable to deny that those meetings had taken place Did Mr. Sánchez send Pérez Tornero the president of Spanish Broadcasting The answer is obviously of course yes and now the secondary actors are on stage Some secondary actors who are those who were already on the board of directors thanks to the quadruple person you know PSOE PP Podemos and my dear gentlemen of the PNV who as I usually tell you are in all the sauces For the Spaniards who are listening to us there was a merit contest and they managed that of those you have put in the one who had the best note was in position number 12 The seventeenth the twenty first the twenty second the thirty fifth and the thirty ninth Do n't worry Mr. Mayoral I 'm telling you 17 21 22 35 and 39 By the way suspense Because they had less than 50 Who was the first suspense The 56th Sure Podemos's was the first suspension had 56 of ordinal and was suspended because he did not even reach the note of 5 as neither did the current president in office They chose the real platoon of the clumsies and of course in clumsies what was going to come out A shameful deal What a cultural battle some have given a small battle through the media And not content with that you have created an organ which we could define almost as a soviet that you call a joint decision making body that will decide on what happens on Spanish Television no less than until 2026 I 'm a soviet Also Stalinist because it's for that for what To worship the image of the beautiful forgiveness of the leader ah yes well let 's say it because it cannot be more beautiful our leader who comes out of each and every circumstance pity or shout at him comes out beautiful thanks to interference on Spanish radios and public televisions That 's his propaganda We say two things The first article 20.3 of the Constitution is very clear the law will regulate the organisation and parliamentary control i.e. from here on of the social media dependent on the State or any public body If the Constitution is not clear we recall that the framework mandate says it has to be independence neutrality pluralism impartiality and rigour Ja ja ja ja ja y ja Six ya Neither independence nor neutrality nor pluralism nor rigour I 'm finishing up Just looking at the last few weeks you 've placed someone who was in the last row and I 'm not talking about the band And the paradigmatic case we have is not just Spanish Television If only in the last few weeks we have these scandals on Spanish Television what can be happening at the EFE Agency which has no parliamentary control even though Article 20.3 of the Constitution says so Look the EFE Agency has to have parliamentary control and this real propaganda state has to end before interference ends There are proposals there We appreciate the contributions that the People 's and Citizens Party has made to us and we are going to work for a compromise so that independence can be restored But look soon will come the days of freedom in the media especially in the public media and freedom of information in Spain not freedom of propaganda And in those days we will stop seeing how they march to the sound of their disgusting propaganda I guarantee that because it will happen because of course it will happen because it will happen very soon Thank you so much
For allusions
It is with regard to the statements made expressly by Mr Álvarez i García who said that we are the fascist group of the House Mr Baldoví about whom we govern in Castile La Mancha and Mr Mena about the alleged threats that have been poured out I mean the three of us and I can group them together in a brief answer
With regard to the remarks of Mr Álvarez i García who has specifically said the Fascist Group of the House I will tell you that the only Fascist Party or with Fascist Heritage of the House is ERC
With regard to the reference to the fact that there is a fascist group in this House I refer to the foregoing There 's only one who has a fascist heritage
Minister good morning You did not have to lie or disrespect the third political force in this House You did n't have to I am concerned about your lack of respect but I am also concerned about the lack of respect for millions of Spaniards with whom we are speaking you pride yourself on your representation without having it and lack respect for them That you lie to me does n't matter to me our group does n't care and many Spaniards do n't because we 're going to report their lies systematically Minister I had another tone in my speech but you are so cowardly that you have not even been able to mention the group that is presenting this amendment Yes the VOX Parliamentary Group has tabled an amendment in its entirety because this bill in some of its aspects goes against the national sovereignty of Spain which you should represent Minister liar and faulty I repeat it completely changed the tone of my speech for a few minutes What 's going on That the amendment to the entire PNV a few days ago would not have been subject to the same insults and falsehoods that you have launched What 's going on That the PNV is not against cooperation because it has tabled a full amendment which it withdrew on Wednesday Ah Ah That what you like is negotiation in the dark and small offices What 's going on That parliamentarianism has died in Spain That we can't come to Parliament to discuss the laws Is that against something Minister Is that going against something Do n't take it so personally You are not so great that we are against you or your Government We 're in favor of a lot of things You have not even been able to listen to what we have said in the Commission He did n't even dignify himself His team which is probably the one who does the dirty work to get these things out has not been worthy to listen to us because among other things in this law there are at least five ideas that VOX first raised You 're going to sleep tonight supporting a law that probably takes five ideas that we were the first to put forward There she is I had a fucking team because I doubted will this man introduce her It is that we have four foreign ministers in the government of Don Pedro Sánchez four You do not need to stand up and teach us but you too as so many ministers of this Government probably have the expiry date set Four foreign ministers four promises four changes in the approach to Spanish cooperation And you say we can't have our own opinion If we do not know the opinion on the cooperation that the government of Pedro Sánchez will have next year Four different ministers with four different approaches to cooperation I wish you very much to remain in office that is within a government that lasts as little as possible because we are not going to become too generous either In addition this comes for discussion and we are presenting a whole amendment of course And I repeat that you have not had any insults or disrespect towards the PNV which represents many less Spaniards and with whom you will have negotiated something you will tell us at some point in this debate what it has been when and how to withdraw your amendment altogether because something has been negotiated Or do you think that the PNV withdraws something for free It 's just come on I remind you that you are the Minister of Foreign Affairs of all Spaniards even those you hate and those who lack respect Yeah yeah yeah In his sustained and 'sustainable words in appearances he has said rather unpleasant things because he says that we are not in solidarity because he says that we do not give our time because he says that we have not played our lives being in those operations or cooperative missions It 's just that you have n't even looked at our résumés it 's just that you have n't heard from where we 've been or where we 've played the skin of many of those in this parliamentary group by cooperating on the ground not from the comfortable chair of the ministry I 'll go to that later because since you insult let 's review another insult Commission for International Development Cooperation I ask what 's the point Because you Minister have disrespected your colleagues in the groups that support you This procedure will be carried out by another Commission the Foreign Affairs Committee What 's going on That you 're right We proposed that development cooperation should be integrated into foreign affairs and you give us reason but you lack respect for your colleagues your partners and your companions By the way there are very good people in that Commission outside the enormous ideological distances we have There are very good people and very good people and you do n't stop disrespecting them and leaving them for no reason They give me a little tenderness because we may not agree on some details but we do agree on the bottom I repeat do not disrespect millions of Spaniards by saying that we do not want solidarity that we do not want to remove hunger in the world that we do not want equality for all and that we do not want freedom for all Do n't disrespect us including your comrades Going into detail we tabled an amendment to the whole because after twenty five years you fail You do three things in this law The first is that you of course without competence and we will see that without having a category for it sell Spain 's national sovereignty to international entities that do not even define correctly There are concepts like global citizenship global public goods can you show me your global citizenship card Can you show me the record of ownership of those global assets Who do they belong to Oh no they 're in the clouds as that cloud observer will always remind us This is a serious matter and therefore we are presenting an amendment of the whole that could have been read It 's two pages Minister it was n't much effort it was n't much effort Instead of reading the speech he was given I could have read it I have tabled an amendment in its entirety A bit of a game to which he makes an amendment to the whole I 'm sure PNV 's read it to her It speaks of global governance It says the construction of global democratic governance What 's the matter with you Is this Parliament going to disband the brave with this law and will it deprive us of the right to represent the Spaniards here which is the only place where national sovereignty resides It is that that is the point one of our amendment to the whole that you are taking away national sovereignty from us But it just does n't belong to you National sovereignty is not questionable even if its partners discuss it Sovereignty resides in the Spanish people the only depositary represented by the way in the General Courts And on top of that you take in world mantras I think you read little because just read what the UN says about some of the elements that you say are fundamental It says the United Nations and I quote The agenda its agenda implies a common and universal commitment however since each country faces specific challenges in its quest for sustainable development States have full sovereignty over their wealth resources and economic activity and each will set its own national goals You 've invented a new kind of cateto the global cateto I 'm gonna do a soccer simile It 's the cat that goes to the Champions or the World Cup gets excited and when you ask what has been brought answers Well look I 've brought the referee 's t- shirt the corner 's flag and I 've been signed the rules That instead of coming in with the national shirt perfectly represented You like so many others are not representing Spain 's national interests as the UN says So what 's going on That this new global cathet passes through the meanders of the terms and norms that may have been designed well intentionally in a global or globalistic way but that do not necessarily apply to a country like Spain Because you Minister just as you do n't like a lot of Spaniards you do n't seem to like Spain either Here they rely on a few obviously on those who do not like Spain or the Spanish but also on some who so long as they are accepted in the club of progress are capable of anything This PP which is getting whiter and more moderate continues to be delivered to the 2030 Agenda happy to have entered that club at the time This global and globalist catechism empties us of sovereignty to impose ideas and instead of looking at what we can do with what we have and going out there to help free and equal citizens like the Spaniards we are dedicated to importing agendas and objectives This is very funny because the second reason why we are going against this bill is not because of its technical aspects if I had read our amendment as a whole I would know but because you have invented globalist neocolonialism You intend to impose a global agenda on citizens of other countries who have not yet fallen into the trap This is pure colonialism This bill literally says that Spain has to impose a number of ideas on other countries Well no that 's not what cooperation is about and we all know that we 've been on the ground The word cooperation comes from an Indo European language and the prefix co means all together cooperate and all the words that begin with co go around That does not mean that you take the ideas that others have dictated to you and will distribute them throughout the world with this new compulsory and necessary religion in which if you are not you cannot even submit an amendment to the whole even if it is a right of parliamentary groups Not happy with that that ideology becomes very fun Then you have the right to reply and I have another turn but I want to talk to you about this Minister vulva to vulva Instead of talking about hunger instead of talking about water and thirst instead of talking about housing we go to Tegucigalpa with the logo of Spanish cooperation with the logo of the Kingdom of Spain and with the logo of the ministry to which the vulva speak among them Minister really From vulva to vulva do you think this helps a single human being Not only that but above the web where this is you are so unconscious that you have even named the assistants So we have told all Tegucigalpa on top of the logo of the Kingdom of Spain who are the poor trans who have come in confidence to our vulva workshop Do you think that 's serious We will talk later on about other aspects and fundamentally we will talk about the relationship with anti-democratic regimes But above all I wanted to say that Spain 's national sovereignty does not belong to you it belongs to all the Spaniards specifically represented here a law cannot deliver it and less to become the new colonial distributors of this religion of gender space and environment that you want to impose on us We 're still talking Minister
Don Felix Bolaños you 're here are n't you You are so politically supportive that you cancel a parliamentary question because theoretically you had something to do elsewhere Are you Don Félix Bolaños the minister Yeah Do n't you He tells me not with his head It 's just that I have to ask the minister Minister of propaganda and public illustration I never thought we 'd miss Don Iván Redondo a great professional I never thought we would have to review once again all that you have done in order not to maintain the independence or impartiality of Spanish Broadcasting Yesterday we had a debate which you missed on a proposal which did not advance by the way congratulations on the bravery of the PP abstaining to ensure that there was greater control over Spanish Television and the EFE Agency Today it seems to be courageous courageous ministers who avoid questions about whether a referendum will be held in coordination with their partners in Catalonia That has not been answered because you have neither courage nor political courage What have you done with Spanish Television When I say you two I mean the two bands a rather absent one We 've had decades of sectarian television We have suffered Rosa María Mateo and as she defined her horrific television She was a temporary administrator but in the end we had her for months and months by the way unforgettable afternoons and mornings of glory we had in the control sessions We suffered from the ridiculous process of choosing counselors The Four Pes PSOE People 's Party Podemos and PNV chose their advisors and ignored the list ascending to those who had suspended to whom a committee of experts who lacked respect had chosen for their merit and ability and ascended you the four pes to the most clumsy to the most useless to those who did not cross the line But of course if that 's what you do to choose your public representatives how are you not going to do that too to control Spanish Broadcasting Then we have suffered a certain Pérez Tornero aka the Brief kneeling at his service who has suffered the torpedoing from within the coup d'état from within first of the partners of the fourth pe that of Podemos by the way it is the one who has the least qualification and qualification in these matters but also we have discovered recently the torpedoing of the PSOE itself We have suffered from their blemishes minister yours yours minister of propaganda Because what independence is that of the visits to Moncloa by the president of Spanish Broadcasting Is that independence Who is the president of Spanish Radio Television depending on If you visit Moncloa then that 's it It 's already up to you is n't it How many have there been in these weeks Who 's he meeting with What have you had to do with those visits Why have you also visited a councillor now temporary president at Moncloa headquarters Is ham good Are the beers good Or were you putting your hands on Spanish Radio The four people announced that this was in favour of independence Are you doing as always a plumber and kneeling down to play the Spanish Television pipes I 'm afraid so These courts are the ones that appoint councillors and presidents although then you pact in the dark and dirty offices And now above until new provisional president by royal decree by royal decree you consolidate the coup d'état on Spanish Television giving full powers to the new provisional president So Minister of State Propaganda please explain to me as requested by this inquiry what steps you will take to ensure independence and impartiality I will try not to laugh we will try not to break our breasts of laughter or cry for the lies that you are going to tell us because it is obviously neither independent nor impartial Do n't put that face on me it makes me soft it makes me soft It becomes small soft like cotton But yes we already know that they are their mirrors of azabache that their eyes are hard because you are increasingly tougher in your propaganda Every day we have more and worse propaganda I repeat I never thought I would miss Ivan Redondo because you have returned to an ancient crude propaganda that of I 'm going to control the medium and so That we are in the 21st century do something more modern It 's that of controlling the medium because that they did when the first Spanish Television broadcasts in 1938 that I said yesterday with Telefunken That 's what Germany did in 1938 The founders of Spanish Television Spanish Radio and EFE are what they did controlling the media thinking that they control the message You are so rude you are so old that you do that as a minister of propaganda And for what Because one wonders why do you want this If you have the government They rule by royal decree They are the government with the most real decrees And I say is n't it because elections are coming Is n't that I love this smell I love the smell of election in the morning because it smells like victory I love how a government smells that breaks down because it means that you are finally going to listen to the Spaniards and because you are finally starting to smell victory not yours and your state of propaganda In front of this state of propaganda in which you control Spanish Broadcasting EFE the media of the duopoly the institutional campaigns the millions of institutional campaigns the CIS Tezanos another one kneeling before the Government explain to me how you will justify the independence of those who visit Moncloa and the impartiality of those who choose Moncloa and not these Courts not this Parliament And do it please in such a way that it is soft that I do n't have to laugh that I do n't have to break my chest with my companions seeing the lies he 's going to tell us But do n't worry now your azabach mirrors so hard are going to come up here and you are going to read that speech that your advisers have prepared for you which I know you have been preparing it you are so worried that you did n't even want to answer this morning 's question It 's okay it 's okay this is simple now you 'll take off your soft negotiator suit cotton as I was saying and I do n't know personal disqualifications will come they 'll come By the way I was describing him I was n't saying Oh sorry of course that you may have interpreted that when you were talking about Platero you were talking about the donkey No no that was n't my intention But you are now going to say many ists many disqualifications to that triangle that we know this will be Franco 's fault it will be the virus 's fault it will be Meloni 's fault It 's Meloni 's fault You will make references to this this this Look this goes from Spanish Television and up there in the henhouse by the way Madam President with a wonderful subtropical climate that we usually enjoy when some of you say a isa or 'some of these disqualifications we play water shots or bingo We scream line bingo When you go to disqualifications As this goes from Spanish Television while you try to explain to me this alleged independence and this state of propaganda we are going to play the One two three Minister I see you 're a non-minister giving him some advice I 'm glad it 's someone like that who 's giving you the advice Minister let 's play One two three Minister I 'm questioning you Minister over here I 'm questioning him Minister let 's play One two three For 5 euros to see how many words finished in this you can say Minister of Propaganda Thank you so much
"With the venom Today we are dealing with a more or less reasonable amendment of an infamous law which is the law of sexual freedom and I say that this amendment is a reasonable means because in VOX of course we are against female genital mutilation and we are also against male genital mutilation because it exists although you believe that man is born with an invisible armor and that he cannot suffer aggression We are also against forced sterilization against forced abortion because we believe that forced abortion is a form of violence against women and children but I want to make it clear that abortion that is not forced is the worst form of violence because it ends the life of an innocent child Its own anti-gender violence shingle estimated two years ago that in Spain there are some 15,562 girls who are susceptible to genital mutilation Its mutilators come from guess where exactly from countries where genital mutilation is practiced In view of this you propose to develop protocols Is this really a matter of protocols Would n't it be better to admit once your multicleti roll does n't work Is it not time to give in to the evidence that indiscriminate immigration will be very good for you to seem supportive but causes very serious problems for the Spanish on foot That is why the amendment leaves its inconsistencies to the naked Are n't all cultures the same Are they not their customs and must they be respected Let 's see if it 's going to be that VOX was right and there are cultures that do n't respect women let 's see if the feminist today is going to be realizing this uncomfortable truth that we have to close the door in the face to people who come to Spain to attack women However what is serious is not the amendment it is a lesser evil within the great festival of infamy which is this law which with the excuse of protecting women wants to inoculate ideology by charging itself with rights They have already broken equality before the law with the law of gender violence they have broken the presumption of innocence they have already crossed that line of non-return because when the rulers undermine a fundamental right there is no turning back That 's why there are first times we can't afford because nothing is the same after them the first time you cheat the first time you steal the first time you pardon the thief lords of the PSOE the first time you cheat saying you wo n't pardon the thief but you pardon him President Sánchez is a serial liar and the Spaniards have taken many infidelities from him fortunately there is nothing left for Spanish society to sign the divorce suit and put their bags at the door But first he intends to leave us this law which is another brick in the wall of sexual apartheid suffered by men in Spain Now I ask the men who are in the Chamber to imagine for a minute that they had a consensual sexual relationship with a woman or that they did not even have a relationship with a woman and the woman denounces them His friends his acquaintances his family his coworkers his children and as the process goes on the people who know him say he will be guilty because if the woman accuses him and as the woman never lies To all this we must add that Minister Irene Montero puts a tweet where she says that he is guilty without proof Add to this that in every process you will not be able to see your children by the infamous article 94 of the Civil Code Imagine for a second that this happens to you Is n't this violence Is it not political violence is it not institutional violence against men is it not a flagrant violation of the presumption of innocence I told them that yes that of course it is because the goal is not to protect women it is to destroy men that is the white man because after the law of gender violence this is the most racist homophobic and sexist law there is This law criminalizes a race the white one it protects a sex the woman and it only protects a sexual orientation the hetero All this misconception about a measure of unproven consent whose only purpose is for the white man to fall Ladies and gentlemen the end will never justify the means A woman 's word is worth nothing more than that of a man because she is a woman and a woman 's rights are worth nothing more than a man 's rights because she is a woman There are personal dramas situations of sexual violence that we must combat but neither violence is fought with injustices nor the woman is defended by attacking the man nor is she defended by propaganda that the man is aggressive per se nor are you anyone to get into anyone 's bed nor do you have to tell us how we have to copulate nor does Mrs Montero have to tell us Men and women are equal in dignity and any law or ideology that violates this principle is a rotten law and ideology VOX will always be with anyone who is a victim of sexual violence we do n't care if she is a woman or a man a child or a girl and we will work for fair laws that do n't criminalize half the country We want laws that advocate for the toughening of penalties so that sexual aggressors are in jail and not on the street laws that keep away from our borders our neighborhoods and our streets to those who come here to assault women not respecting our sexual freedom As Emile Zola said the truth is on its way and nothing will stop it More and more Spaniards are fed up with the consequences of their gender laws more and more women are sick of going insecure on the street because of the herd rapes that cannot be talked about more and more women are sick of their feminism that oppresses us and speaks on our behalf more and more women are sick of hell that pass through their men and more and more men are sick of the insecurity that women suffer and tired of being always suspected of being men More and more Spaniards open their eyes to the truth and will take them out of power with the plethoric joy of a liberated animal Ladies and gentlemen let him report it Let him prove it The rapist to prison the protective mothers who report falsely and kidnap the children to jail the immigrants who sexually assault to their country the discriminatory laws to trash and you totalitarians who do not protect women and who make a hell of the life of innocent people to the street"
With the venom Mrs Montero you are the worst thing that has happened to Spain in recent years 592 million euros to end equality and freedom imposing in Spain the infamous gender ideology This ideology like all totalitarianisms is disguised as equality freedom and happiness but the reality is very different This scientific creed which uses fictitious collectives to victimize them at the stroke of law and of chiringuitos preaches that gender is a constructosocial distinct from biological sex that we can choose our identity regardless of reality and all this accompanied by a crazy and complex feminism What 's the end Destroy human nature under the banners of equality and freedom It is a matter of making an alienated human being without family ties or love and commitment without ties to reality a human being who has everything he wants like an evil child at the expense of the rights of others for example abortion a human being victimized ignorant without discernment and therefore manipulable without spirituality irreligious hedonist merely bodily and genital In short a man in whom human nature disappears And how is this world of alienated people created For through language propaganda indoctrination legislation and a lot of money in total EUR 592 million Of those €592 million 190 are for the Correspondent Plan which is a nice way of saying that the State is getting into our homes to tell us how we have to organize men and women time and tasks 27 million for a Women 's Institute which has two basic ends to promote a feminism of male haters and to promote abortion 320 million for the fight against what you call gender violence that is to leave women unprotected to criminalize men to violate their presumption of innocence and that they can be accused without evidence and to abandon children who are assaulted abused and abducted when the offender is a woman The law of sexual freedom is more than the same to facilitate false complaints against men to demonize any input that a woman does not like to decriminalize the sex of children under the age of sixteen and to release the culprits to the street We 're never gonna be able to get here alone and drunk I have to make a forced stop here Minister liberating rapists I do not rule out the fact that this reduction in penalties has been made with premeditation and awe given his allergy to having murderers out of prison but he has also dared to insult the entire judiciary You have to have it of reinforced cement to insult professionals who have spent years of their life studying law and an opposition when the only merit you have is Minister you knew your law would lower the penalties
Freedom Freedom Freedom
"Minister you knew your law would lower the penalties you 've had many reports in your hands Be brave and say it you want criminals on the street you want rape victims or child abuse victims to be afraid because fear is what your ideology and ministry nourishes It is 7 million euros to promote LGTBI and trans laws to give privileges to people according to who they sleep with financial impose corruption of minors to advertise the self perception of sex passing through the arch of triumph biological reality and to promote irreversible mutilation All this reinforced by the law of equality which with the excuse of avoiding discrimination does what it does is to cut the freedoms in a flagrant way to the Spaniards Special mention deserves his propaganda in favor of abortion to legitimize as a right what is nothing more than murder and promote it like trans law in minors without parental consent Not to mention expenses as scandalous as 1 250 000 euros in a campaign to be obese and go unwaxed 17,000 euros in a report on the benefits of excusing women prisoners what love and vice you have with letting go of criminals 2 million euros for the campaign of The Soft Man and 18,000 euros in studies to know if women have more orgasms with their partner or masturbating In addition to spending money on things that are intimate aspects of our lives you are a sexual obsession In short Mrs Montero your ministry 's budgets are aimed at violating fundamental rights and inventing false rights criminalizing men and giving priority to women gay and transgender treating them as if they were disabled They are budgets that abandon abused or abused women and children when the criminal is a woman they are budgets to corrupt children in schools promote pederasty and the sex of minors All this is what promotes gender ideology and its ministry If I had a minimum of shame a minimum of sense of honor he will resign but since you do not leave the table resign the Spaniards have to pay in our meats in our children and in our pockets all their traumas You are the minister who has done the most harm to women because fighting for women is not talking in Asturian not dressing in purple not giving us quotas as if we were incapable To fight for children is not to leave them orphaned by a living father for the mere denunciation of a woman nor to pervert them with sexual content nor to abandon them when abused prostituted or abducted by the mother Fighting for children is not silence when a girl is murdered by her mother nor defending that children can have consensual sex with whomever they want as you have defended not once but twice History will judge you Minister but in the meantime we tell you that you are incapacitated and delegitimized to be a minister and to exercise no political office In addition these €592 million are intended to incite hatred against anyone who disagrees with you whether innocent men judges or VOX There you have stuck in your bones your ministry of hatred is a danger to our fundamental rights These are the budgets of totalitarianism ruin and hatred The most harmful because they break families destroy lives corrupt minors and end equality and freedom Therefore in VOX we are not going to leave a lie unchallenged nor a gender law without repealing We will not leave a woman or man or child unprotected or a life of an unborn or unsaved We 're not leaving a family without helping"
With the venom Chesterton claimed that one day a sword would have to be raised to say that the grass is green That day has come with this trans law that we are dealing with today a law that forces us to turn our backs on reality and will penalize those who refuse to do so This law whose contents must be remembered that they are already in autonomous laws promulgated by the People 's Party for example in the law of the Community of Madrid imposes a single vision of the world that of gender ideology a vision without any scientific backing for which sexual identity is a subjective experience independent of biological sex They put of course their favorite ghost the concept of gender as a social construct and therefore modifying the will and subordinated to the wishes of the individual It is a foolish proposal but I understand that tempting remembers that you will be as gods of Genesis because it puts in our hands a reality that we believed to be immutable and creates with it a false illusion of freedom But true freedom is not built from behind to reality but by looking at it face to face Freedom is built with truth and the truth is that you want to build a world based on desires and self perceptions completely away from reality They miserably use the tragedy of intersex people of people who do not identify with their biological sex of adolescents who suffer from gender dysphoria to pass the trans apisonadora and impose it on society The cases of these people are tragic and what we must do is support them and accompany them Our society is able to offer respect and protection to intersex people transsexual people and adolescents with gender dysphoria but this support cannot be from an ideological perspective it has to be from a medical scientific and above all truly human perspective This minimum number of cases does not justify what this law seeks The truth is that this law seeks to promote transsexuality under the pretext of avoiding discrimination To encourage her for what Would n't it be wiser to promote a family model open to life given the demographic winter we are experiencing in Spain But no your social engineering work needs broken children and adults no identity because they want us slaves This law includes studies surveys a council of participation of LGBTI people campaigns badges to companies for the promotion of transsexuality measures of positive discrimination at work What does this have to do with avoiding discrimination By the way it is already penalized in our legal system and in addition all LGBT people in Spain have the same rights as the rest as it has to be It 's not about avoiding discrimination it 's about getting degenerate ideology into our veins and creating privileges Privileges go to the extreme that if a trans person denounces someone because they feel discriminated against the burden of proof is reversed and it will be the person who will have to prove it is not well known how that does not discriminate Within this wild promotion we come to the most intolerable point of this law children Minister of Equality you as a good totalitarian want to educate our children sexually You have spoken in favour of the corruption of minors you have spoken in favour of sex between minors and that of minors with adults If it was n't true he could have retracted had many days to do so and did n't want to What you 've done has been to blame the far right He missed Franco and Putin But even by obviating these scandalous statements which in a normal country would have made him resign the Spaniards are not willing to sexually adopt our children He 's going to meet many Spaniards full of legitimate concern like that overwhelming majority of parents we want our children madly regardless of ideology You are no one to question it Mrs Montero nor to presume otherwise because those parents are concerned that our children are engaged in a war against their own bodies for life and without going back and because we are concerned that they are sterile adults and chronic drugs Mrs. Montero we do n't want them to experiment with their bodies we do n't want them to talk about masturbation we do n't want them to doubt if they 're boys and girls we do n't want them to educate them differently from our beliefs To say this is not to be retrograde or fascist or ancient it is to love our children and to ensure their purity and innocence Here we come to the bloodiest point of the law the change of sex of children for registered purposes A change of sex that will be possible since the age of twelve and in solitary at sixteen counting we are told with the maturity and stability of the minor as if maturity stability and lesser were not an oxymoron These children who suffer from gender dysphoria are usually male about 0.015 and are usually male because in many cases during pregnancy when they were in their mother 's womb they had a testosterone deficiency that is then regulated in adolescence in a natural way
What is happening now is that based on propaganda and laws like this there is more and more dysphoria in adolescents and girls In the United Kingdom the number has increased by 4400 over the last ten years and in Sweden by 1500 Let 's be serious dysphoria does n't multiply because it does This is not a physiological dysphoria it is a cultural dysphoria because they are children with problems who end up being victims of their indoctrination The registrar change is only the first case before social change hormonal change and then surgical change or in other words irreversible mutilation It should not be forgotten that this chain of brutal changes begins with a self diagnosis I do n't want to trivialize but for you to understand the example it 's as if a person goes to a psychiatrist self defining as a schizophrenic and the psychiatrist is obliged to treat him and medicate him as a schizophrenic The State cannot prevail over parents and force them to unprotect their children in a vital phase of change and particular vulnerability The State cannot handcuff parents to the decisions of their minor children when they are not mature enough Gentlemen of the Government get your dirty hands off our children By the way Mrs. Montero a lot of trans law a lot of self perception a lot of everyone all and everything that we all seem Asturian but when you were pregnant with your daughter she announced to the world that she was a child Why For his genitals And with regard to adults to legislate according to desires or self perceptions degenerates into legal frauds and ridiculous absurd and even dangerous situations Let 's see men who will have access to women 's privacy spaces like bathrooms showers and women wo n't be able to do anything to avoid it We will see men fraudulently using this law to compete in sports with physical advantages over women with the prejudices and injustices that this will cause in sport Also following absurdity why do we focus only on self perception of sex If what matters is how everyone feels why do we not legislate on self perception of age nationality marital status or employment status Can you imagine a world where everyone is forced to treat us like we feel Posts to legislate on self perceptions and unrealities why only about sex This law discriminates against people who may feel like a platypus or Lady Gaga But VOX as always does not hurt us to reaffirm our commitment to common sense to the family to children and above all to the truth in spite of whoever weighs it no matter how much it criminalizes us and distorts our discourse They may tear down one or two generations of Spaniards perhaps their poison will spread more but be clear that they will have us face up to defending first of all the right of parents to educate their children according to their convictions and defending the sovereign and heroic role of the family in front of the State Ladies and gentlemen today is the day of shouting grass is green boys have penis and girls vagina sex is binary biology is real gender ideology is cancer This is the most totalitarian and destructive government of our democracy and VOX is the only party that defends and will defend good truth and beauty
"With the venom Gender ideology is the road map of this Government This ideology destroys human nature and is based on the idea that my desire is the law even if fundamental rights and lives are taken forward The law is the paradigm of that dictatorship of desires because it will allow people to be treated legally and socially how they feel sexually and not as what they really are This sectarian bodrio rejected also by her feminist comrades minister who ignores biology for the sake of gender a concept that does not exist in people does not intend to help homosexual or trans people what it seeks is to change and destroy society destroying and changing the serhuman using the suffering of people who do not feel identified with their biological sex to impose their ideology But the bloodiest part of this law is children and ensuring the protection of children means helping parents to protect and guide them They want 12 year olds who are not mature enough to drive or vote who need permission from their parents to go on a zoo tour with the school to decide on their bodies to abort and to get hormone and mutilate With this law they are limiting parental parental authority in circumstances where children need them more than ever Instead of helping parents they are eliminating them from the equation as if the family were not the most important shelter for a child Cases of dysphoria i.e. of children who reject their bodies and seek a different physical and sexual aesthetics have always been very few and most children Now apparently there is more and more for one reason for the trans propaganda of governments like this which indoctrines them with talks which are 1 in schools and on social networks To that there follows an infamous pressure on adults which makes them believe that the only solution to their problems is to be trans I give the example of Primary Care in Catalonia where the hormone is prescribed for 87 of the cases during the first visit Ladies and gentlemen a child who rejects his body is a child who suffers is a child without self esteem who feels unhappy who in many cases has family problems who has suffered abuse bullying anorexia and therefore rejects his body not his sexual identity What this child needs is to be heard and cared for he needs a full multidisciplinary medical diagnosis which includes a physical and psychological assessment to study his emotional problems which are most of the time the origin of dysphoria There is already experience of what this dysphoria caused by indoctrination or fashions means for children and families In the United States in just four years from 2017 to 2021 cases of false dysphoria nearly tripled from 15,000 cases to 42,000 and nearly 5,000 adolescents took puberty blockers The problem is that you minister propose to teenagers a path without return when they are simply under the influence of fashions or having a teen with problems The repentance of these children or the chronic health and psychological problems that drag any trans person are uncomfortable realities that you do n't want to hear and that 's why you accuse us of transphobia Despite having been warned by many health professionals and medical institutions that the child has no capacity to understand the consequences of his or her decision in the short and long term less the legal ones and that the law puts the physical and mental health of the children at risk you have not listened to anyone even forcing psychologists and doctors to accept a child 's self diagnosis as if a doctor had to diet an anorexic girl because she feels fat 1 Words withdrawn by the Presidency in accordance with Rule 104.3 of the Rules of Procedure of the House Remove the blindfold in this case remove the blue pink and white flag and go to the real causes of the problem which there are many lives at stake But the dramatic reality is that you Mrs. Montero children care about a curse That 's why he ignores them when they are kidnapped abused even murdered by a woman so he promotes as a right to put children in his mother 's womb and that 's why this law seeks to indoctrinate them and push them into transsexuality You only care about children as necessary pawns in your social engineering project That is why it needs 2 to encourage them to have sex and destroy their identity and sexuality separating them from their family and their parents values They want an alienated society based on unicorns but reality is silly ladies and gentlemen and let 's not say biology As much as they manipulate language by many unscientific laws they enact grass remains green boys have penis and vagina girls The People 's Party by the way will have to look at its bipolarity by criticizing and rejecting this law today when in the Community of Madrid they enacted and maintain a similar law When you do n't have convictions you get these inconsistencies Only with consistency and truth can we help people who suffer and who do not feel identified with their body Know one thing we love these people more because we do n't care who they sleep with or what they feel We believe in the dignity of all people especially those who deserve support and help because they suffer We want them more because we reject any paternalism and condescension as this law does to give privileges in the workplace and other areas to people because they are homosexual or trans as if they were inferior We want them more because we consider them the same But as much as you work to destroy the person the family and our society we will rebuild it Because the truth is still there the truth is an incredibly resistant plant that grows in the dark and hangs through any hole As long as that seed of truth is there it cannot be expelled from Parliament even if it causes scandal as long as that seed remains in our lives and in our families and as long as there is someone who defends it and that someone is VOX We are the only ones who fight for the truth for the equality and dignity of all and we will give this battle not against anyone but for us for you for our children and also for yours"
With the venom With this proposed law a case is added to article 177 bis of the Criminal Code to make penalties worse for cases where the victim is a vulnerable person due to armed conflict or a humanitarian catastrophe Firstly we welcome the change in the scope of law enforcement It would be absurd to circumscribe this worsening of the penalty only to the victims of the war in Ukraine as was originally thought although as an initiative of the PSOE it would not have been rare to see them make a proposal in which justice and equality will shine through their absence and there would be first and second victims as we are already accustomed to gender laws Massive population displacements are often carried out in armed conflict or humanitarian catastrophes The instability caused by war makes it possible for human traffickers to take advantage of the vulnerability of those who suffer from it In particular trafficking in persons is rightly referred to as the slavery of the twenty first century because this crime violates a number of fundamental rights such as physical integrity psychological integrity freedom and dignity Victims of trafficking are held in slavery by force coercion or intimidation and are lied to about work living conditions travel and their legal future They are displaced by traffickers from one place to another so that they are isolated and coerced and blackmailed so that they do not report They live hell in life of threats and fear Their lives are marked by the abuse the violation of their human rights and the control of their traffickers For all this we consider it essential to tighten the penalties for those guilty of trafficking just as it is essential that we put all the means at our disposal to detect these situations For this it is necessary to make visible that word that you like so much the reality of trafficking to make visible all victims because they are all equally important On the one hand we have the victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation the only or most commonly spoken of Why Because most of the victims are women because they are the victims that best suit their causes Therefore they keep bragging about the Road Plan their new plan to in theory give economic labour and social alternatives to trafficked women for the purpose of sexual exploitation A Road Plan by the way with 204 million euros But what is behind this plan and this sudden interest in human trafficking I believe that it is necessary for the Spaniards to know that the Road Plan aims to give privileged treatment to the women alleged victims of trafficking without complaint and therefore without sentences They want to reward victims of trafficking without sentences with massive regularizations and give them an administrative accreditation document proving their status as victims of trafficking without a sentence Ladies and gentlemen of the PSOE this music sounds to me it has a melody very similar to the comprehensive law against gender based violence feminism always simulating concern for women although they really do not care about anything or anyone as we have seen these days in a bloody way they may want to make another collage of false complaints and self reported victims And it is not a question of not having to deal with these victims of course because in addition to their lack of freedom we have to deal with the very harsh circumstances in which they live sexually transmitted diseases sexual abuse rape forced abortion post abortion syndrome but always from rigour and legal certainty But there are other victims of trafficking victims of labour exploitation who must also be made visible It is many men who suffer it also women and children especially in the fields of agriculture construction clandestine workshops hospitality and who as victims of trafficking as well as lack of freedom suffer major health problems injuries and chronic pain due to the harsh conditions under which they are forced to work By the way this type of trafficking is closely linked to illegal immigration which you promote by allowing the violation of our borders in a systematic manner Maybe that 's why we heard less about this kind of trafficking And let us not forget the children the most vulnerable victims who because of the trafficking they are victims of sexual and labour exploitation suffer from depression anxiety sexual disorders injuries malnutrition problems that a child should never live or know You gentlemen of the PSOE seemingly very concerned about all these people bring here this proposal of law which as I have said we support but I have to tell you it is very surprising that you with this proposal want to fight against trafficking against the sexual exploitation of women you who have spent so much money on prostitutes from the Andalusian unemployed How many of those prostitutes would n't be trafficked You today call for tougher penalties to protect trafficked women but refuse to harden penalties to protect women from recidivist murderers and rapists Today you tear clothes with human trafficking while practicing an open border policy and giving free access to the mafias and organizations that trade with people Pure incoherence ladies and gentlemen and this time they go like headless chicken but with pure carambola they have made it right We reiterate our support for this initiative because our position is very consistent and very simple VOX is always in favour of toughening penalties for criminals and is always on the side of vulnerable people There you will always have us to help the victims and give them everything they need to alleviate their suffering and make their lives happier and fuller We believe that trafficking in all its forms slavery and prostitution offend human dignity Trafficking in persons corrupts our civilization and dishonours those who practice it not those who suffer their injustice Therefore we hope that this toughening of the penalties for trafficking will apply to everyone equally without distinction of sex without sectarianism or ideological burdens in any direction All the victims deserve us to be legislators with capitals and that means that we legislate in the search for good according to the law
With the venom Today we are here to claim the equality of all Spaniards and the ill treated article 14 of the Constitution We could talk about a negligent inequality such as that caused by the different laws of the autonomous communities or the inequality that will cause the worst law of education of our democracy or that caused by the rise of light but in VOX today we want to denounce the inequality caused painfully that which is created with full conscience with a plan and the plan is nothing other than collective alienation to under the false flag of human rights trample them and abuse them And how many abuses are being committed in the name of equality ladies and gentlemen How many abuses and how much pain is causing the desecration of this word And I speak of pain because today VOX is here to give voice to all the Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of their gender laws some laws that are the origin of inequality and the abuse of fundamental rights VOX is in this rostrum to give voice to all those parents who being innocent cannot see their children or who have to see them at a meeting point under permanent suspicion to all those men who spend nights in the dungeon because the system its system takes away the presumption of innocence It is also to give voice to all those who suffer domestic violence while being ignored and unprotected by their single track ideological laws and to all women who are assaulted and see how their aggressor gets out of jail while the Government spends the resources that should be for them in chiringuitos VOX is in this rostrum to give voice to the women and homosexuals who want to escape from their straitjacket from the totalitarian corset you have imposed on them and to give voice to the children who were not born and who from heaven wonder why they did not respect their right to live by having a disease or to arrive at a difficult time for their mothers These are their victims victims of their twisted and perverse concept of equality victims of the Comprehensive Act against Degenerate Violence the Trans Act the LGTBI Act the Abortion Act the Equal Treatment Act and all their gender laws The Ministry of Equality that hatred macrochiringuito is responsible for these tragedies but it is not the only one alongside it we have the People 's Party an accomplice always necessary and servile who pointed to the feminist and globalist car years ago and who does not dare to go down And we have all the other parties in the parliamentary arch that seem not to realize that supporting these laws are putting the rope around their necks Equality they say yes but while calling for equality they promote a law against gender based violence that criminalizes men and privileges women They demand equality for women without knowing what women are but if the woman who suffers violence is a VOX woman they shut up They demand equality but if a white man is accused of violence they destroy him without evidence if the aggressor or alleged aggressor is an immigrant they shut up They demand equality but if you 're from the LGTB collective privileges and positions They demand equality but if you criticize a left wing woman it is political violence if you criticize or insult VOX women then we deserve it by the sidelines They demand equality but if the abuser or manipulater of children is the father it is vicarious violence if the abuser or manipulater of children is a woman then even we are forbidden to speak of parental alienation They demand equality but if you have a disability it 's legitimate to abort you Do n't fool us ladies and gentlemen that we are few and we know each other a lot None of his laws have improved anyone 's life Therefore to the question posed by this great priestess of inequality and hatred the ineffable Irene Montero on what VOX proposes we answer without complexes We propose equality of truth which involves treating the person with full honesty according to what it truly is not according to what we are interested in We propose a law that protects all victims of violence without discrimination on grounds of sex age or sexual orientation We propose that the aid should be intended for the victims not for chiringuitos We propose that all the weight of the law should fall on those who attack be men or women We propose a firm control of our borders so that no one who does not respect our rights and our way of life remains among us And we call for the defence of fundamental rights from the presumption of innocence to the right to life VOX is the only party that really believes that we are all equal equal in dignity and therefore in rights But to say this is scandalous for your totalitarian thinking because as Hannah Arendt said you totalitarians do not want people to distinguish between reality and fiction between the true and the false And here the false is your supposed struggle for equality and the real thing is that that word is used by you as a gross excuse for the destruction of the person and the family And this is what underlies the gender ideology We propose good life freedom equality justice They are values of natural law and therefore universal applicable to every man and at all times Any legal system that ignores or violates these principles is trying to cossify and denigrate man to turn him into goods subject to sale of constructions and denaturalizations But of course that new man who does n't even know who he is is a much easier product to manipulate for you We will not remain indifferent to the injustice and inequality caused by this ideology and the laws it produces to the fruit that they generate of hatred pain and destruction because in VOX when we talk about equality we talk about the obligation that politicians have to guarantee respect for the dignity of every human being because only by respecting that dignity will the happiness of each and every one of us be possible But of course the premise of all this is to believe that every man deserves that happiness And it seems that after all it imposes the terrible reality that you only want the happiness of a few yours us that of all
"Madam President ladies and gentlemen good morning Indeed Minister these are times of darkness and uncertainty of fears and pre-powers but under no circumstances should they be times of silence or complacency We are faced with a real decree law in principle which is innocuous I would say patch where the general practice of the rule is aimed at regulating labour and social security matters to which we do not object measures for self employed persons measures relating to ERTs and extensions until 31 March the extension of the MECUIDA Plan until 30 June aid to part of the culture sector and to Taurino professionals is extended until 30 June 2022 measures are envisaged but very short with regard to the enterprises and workers of the Canary Islands affected by the volcanic eruption registered in the area of the Old Summit measures for the care of minors are also regulated and finally different issues of the General Law on Social Security are amended In short it comes to alleviate deficiencies and defects of previous regulation created by you and denounced by us But as usual this government which retorts into illegality in a submissive manner comes to the barrage of rules and adds innocently sweetly sweetly sweetly the legitimacy of those who occupy private property without any title enabling it as the rule specifically dictates I insist without any title enabling it proposing to extend until 30 September 2022 the illegal occupation of housing In addition it is a horrendous legislative technique Minister horrendous and biased Notice on 24 February this royal decree was born and this illegal octopus was extended until 30 September 2023 However on 2 March Law 4/2022 leaves it again on 28 February but later in Royal Decree Law 3/2022 of 2 March it returns to 30 September a genuine legislative gallimatías We must pull up again for the government 's incompetence is unheard of We have already said this in the debate on labour reform this government has abandoned the majority of workers making it difficult to create jobs obviating SMEs and the self employed as the main drivers of the occupation in Spain In the meantime the Government its Government Mr Minister has announced that it will allocate 21.3 billion to cross-cutting feminist policies all of which are mandated by the 2030 Agenda They just do n't have the least decorum We are faced with a historical record of the bill of light which we have been reporting for months and with gasoline at almost 2 euros litre and the Government announces that it will allocate 21.3 billion to cross-cutting feminist policies There are 300,000 more long term unemployed today than before the pandemic more than in seventeen European Union countries together and the Government announces that it will allocate 21.3 billion to cross-cutting feminist policies There are 3 112 000 unemployed 13 the highest unemployment rate in the eurozone the OECD and the European Union and the government announces that it will allocate 21 300 million to cross-cutting feminist policies The planned seizure of the self employed is being prepared as has been said here with new contributions with benefits being lost and the Government announces that it will allocate 21,300 million to cross-cutting feminist policies In SEPE offices they are barely able to respond and the Government announces that 21.3 billion will be allocated to cross-cutting feminist policies We continue with fiscal plunder we continue with looting and we continue with inflation and the Government announces that it will allocate € 213 billion to cross-cutting feminist policies It was the Union Solidarity alone that protested against the robbery of light and the rise of prices as early as September 2021 in the face of criticism from all of you and when still Minister the brave patriots of Ukraine were not assaulted and died with honor in the face of the attacks of satrap Putin Their use of war like that of the President of the Government is spurious and miserable Those who used to seek out class unions now will not find them because they are subsidized and are the voice of their master Whoever looks for the lesser evil in VOX is wrong for we are going to find the good possible Anyone who wants to replace sensible agreements for the benefit of Spain and the Spanish by consensus green cursis between left pejos and progress of right that lead us to suicide as a community that forgets us He said at the beginning that they are times of darkness and uncertainty of fears and prepotences but under no circumstances should they be times of silence or complacency Whoever wants a strong but small austere effective and agile state has 21.3 billion reasons to go out on the street on March 19 with Solidarity Anyone who wants solidarity between Spaniards legal certainty private property decent work and the rule of law has 21.3 billion reasons to go out on 19 March with Solidarity To grow without fears live in peace and face tomorrow with optimism there are at least 21,300 million reasons to go out on the street on March 19 with Solidarity Under no circumstances should it be a time of silence or complacency We do not know that in VOX because our certainty is born minister of the pain for Spain and the Spanish Thank you very much Madam President"
Thank you very much Mr President Ladies and gentlemen seventy articles six titles more than a dozen additional provisions five transitional provisions one derogation six final provisions form the draft employment law that we have been discussing these days where the bad arts of the left have shown themselves radiant and bare ready to do anything to achieve their ends by justifying any means Employment Act in line with the rest of the rules that are also passed in these dark days in concert with the new dogmas of the left and their companions left that lost the blush a long time ago and now shows one of the darkest faces Go ahead that socialism already at its birth turned the legitimate and just defense of the workers against the abuse and exploitation of man by man after a materialistic exegesis of life through the creed of the class struggle and slipped into the cultivation of hatred and confrontation which is where it constantly squanders abandoning now the struggle for equality for the struggle of so called gender policies among other injurers We are faced with a law of employment at all only technical or harmless born on the left in its most current version where it is reinvented faithful to its false mystique to continue its work of erosion of freedoms our ways of life and the traditional Western culture yes the famous battle that really interests the battle of ideas Therefore by investigating in the law created by the PSOE with the order and command of Podemos we guess that together with logical measures in a manner of pleasant balsams such as declaring the interprofessional minimum wage unfettered a question that was certainly already being rolled it injects into the text the real reason that moves them after the canvas of complying with the European Union and praise committed to component 23 which is the manic gender perspective obsession that occupies the entire legislative acquis An Employment Act converted into a tragic farce that introduces particular and territorial interests which in no way prioritizes the search aid permanence and location of decent employment as well as preventing the facilitation of conditions of fair and unhindered working environments It is a rule that expressly eliminates from its purposes the search for employment forgetting it in order to embrace obsessively the treatment and priority of the gender perspective that permeates in a cross-sectional way all its policies exposition of reasons dixit ending with any glimpse of seriousness impartiality and common sense which affects in a rage way mainly the middle and most humble classes a rule that modifies SEPE as an autonomous agency to make it a state employment agency and that the real intention of this law is not employment but the mismanagement of unemployment It is a law that introduces the intervention of the Labour Inspectorate at Bildu 's will now that they are neither by reporting on collective redundancies breaking the commitment of the Minister of Labour at the social dialogue table Following the style and style of the President of the Government any word given serves no purpose There is no doubt that the mechanisms proposed to facilitate employment suffer from a clear lack of preconditions for generating employment in Spain current leaders of unemployment throughout the OECD especially youth unemployment The commercialization of the individual already in the language itself when talking about the labour market replacing the anthropological centrality of the person with the ecological that of bias that of gender or digital follows the obsessive dictates of the ILO where the origin ethnicity or gender matter more than the maternity for example term that appears only once and in the presentation of reasons without normative capacity In short it is a law like many others that are being adopted in staorgia without scruples of the left which deepens in inequalities and in its obsession to direct the person through places outside his own nature I would like to address specifically to my colleagues in the parliamentary group to the affiliates and militants of VOX to the compatriots who voted for us and to all the Spaniards who see with concern the adoption of this law among others and the suicidal drift to which the left leads us This government beats the legality as it has again become evident in its absolutist legacy by means of the power of legislative control which allows the insult directed at women and men of VOX when our parliamentarians are censured for non-existent attacks on the honour of parliamentary groups which as you know very well lack legal personality and therefore honour prying into the incompetence of the interpretation of the law Paraphrasing Jaime Balmes they have endeavored to paint VOX parliamentarians as fury outs of the flock that breathe only fire and blood
Mr. President thank you very much These are times of darkness and uncertainty of fears and pre-powers Minister you in the purest leftist style that has been imposed as a dogma of sapphire behavior in this House threatened VOX a short time ago with the following sentence if VOX were to rule they would have massive strikes and mobilizations It was not a distracted warning to navigators but a statement of intentions where it is made clear who commands in the subsidized class unions in Spain turned into tools at the service of the political interests of the left Madam Minister language modifies thought indeed and you only because of this altar threat to the purest Long Knight style that you like so much to justify the negative vote to this labor reform to which we have opposed from the first moment for clear and obvious reasons in form and substance In shape Once again the Government resorts to the misuse of article 86 of the Spanish Constitution and to the figure of the royal decree- law as did the People 's Party at the time by curtailing legislative power in a structural reform which is not a minor issue at all as the Constitutional Court has pointed out And on the merits five amending articles seven additional articles nine transitional articles one derogation and eight final articles incorporating some of the reforms outlined in component 23 of the recovery plan submitted to the European Commission Well without going into the criticism of the still and vaporous texts that appear in the report which admit an interpretation and the contrary hence the Commission accepts them the truth is that the reform is mainly understood in two areas that of contracting and that of collective bargaining In short recruitment it 's just a nominal make up of contracts that costs the same Point Beyond the provisions we could have sought formulas by which the temporality necessary by the Spanish productive model was not associated with precariousness but for this purpose it should have introduced a flexibility mechanism through for example article 41 of the Workers Statute since in the face of complicated situations of companies they can only opt for dismissal That is to say we are once again increasing the cost of hiring the company the tax on labour and more barriers to entry Collective bargaining The aim of ultraactivity and the strengthening of the sectoral agreement when it was already de facto and did not endanger the rights of workers has only one objective according to the text itself and says Recovering the central role and strengthening the legitimate scope of action of the negotiating subjects of the collective agreements In short raise the power of the subsidized left wing unions the same that run through the streets at the hands of terrorists asking for the freedom of ETA prisoners who have killed hundreds of workers So let it be clear that we are not the People 's Party let alone Citizens We will not only admit any labour reform that would be beneficial to Spanish workers to job creation to businesses to boost our economy but we would even be their supporters but not precisely of this reform because this reform as the Government wants only serves the interests of the class unions and the IBEX 35 abandoning the majority of workers making it difficult to create jobs and obviating SMEs and self employed people as the main drivers of the occupation in Spain And most importantly the main thing is forgotten and yet the text itself gives us the clue in the second paragraph of the exhibition first when it is said It is not the labor norm the only place to face and solve these problems and this is where the big changes have to be made Ladies and gentlemen the Spanish State today is a looting and plundering structure of the middle and working classes which confiscates by the double method of inflation on the one hand and the fiscal pressure on the other which is reducing to misery millions of Spaniards when work is the great heritage of many of those Spaniards What can not be done is that a worker who collects 1400 euros costs the company 2200 euros and that moreover that average Spanish Juan has to pay 21 of all his operations to the largest commissioner who is the State without prejudice to all the direct and indirect taxes plus the shameful cost of the party of autonomy A milleurist is a dosmilleurist harassed by the state And as long as the reform penalizes the private sector the Ministry of Labour as the rule is already in force it is allowed to hire temporary workers in particular a thousand in an agency that directly depends on you Minister as is SEPE You can't lie to everyone all the time We are in a society of deceived young people without jobs and with our forgotten older ones who are forced to operate with financial institutions and hire bank cards and cannot even count on the smile of the cashier when they go to the bank for greater glory of digitizations and international agendas It 's those little things that do n't kill time or absence This government is a farce they do not care about the workers what they care about are the privileges of the trade unions which have not represented the workers for a long time Therefore the lesser evil is not admissible when there is a possible good The State must be strong but small austere effective and agile In short in the face of a reform that reinforces confrontation through class unions we propose to sow solidarity in the face of a reform that hinders employment we propose to sow recruitment facilities in the face of continuous State intervention to sow subsidiarity and private initiative in the spirit of prohibition to sow responsibility in the face of the constant threat of sanction to sow advice and help in the face of unnecessary bureaucracy to sow simplicity of processing in the face of arbitrary imposition to sow legal certainty in the face of State abuse to sow the rule of law in the face of Agenda 2030 to sow Agenda Spain Ladies and gentlemen we know the way to grow without fear live in peace and face tomorrow with optimism The flag is high and it's not a game it 's a movement and it 's called VOX Thank you very much Mr President
Mr President ladies and gentlemen Mr Salvador good afternoon Interesting PNL despite the obvious legal limitations The attitude of this Government towards the undoubted lack of resources of all Spaniards is of absolute indifference I do not know what Mr Hortalà the former secretary general of your group would say to this GNP but I can imagine it and so can you but the GNP that we are dealing with is not correct in the diagnosis or in the remedies but simply to see the obvious symptoms Workers are losing purchasing power in the face of government indifference In this sense it would seem reasonable to join the proposed measure with these legal limitations it spoke in theoretical terms because the Spanish above all the most humble and the middle classes deserve especially not only empathy but the obligation to put all the tools at our disposal to achieve what we have always defended in the VOX Parliamentary Group decent wages fair wages and what in justice corresponds However the measure obviouss some issues beyond the legal limitations which you know very well and which would set a very important precedent for intervention Wages as you say have risen by 2.56 and as a result and given the attitude of the indifferent government which has refused to deflate the tables of the IRPF the worker has not lost only the purchasing power that results from subtracting from inflation the rise he has experienced but more In other words the disposable income of workers has risen less than 2.56 because of the non-correction of the bases and the progressive nature of the tax in the face of government indifference Also a rise in wages with the formula that it proposes in addition to with law rank and already knows that that is very difficult would generate second round effects In other words it could lead us to a spiral of price wage price increases that would keep inflation high for a long time and that must be avoided by all means as it could not be assumed by employers in all cases thereby increasing unemployment and closing down the business And the self employed will have 10 more income And will self employed people and SMEs with one two three four or five workers have a 10 higher income in order to be able to take on that 10 increase And thus the proposal as described could generate comparative grievances in the second point which would affect distributive justice because it seeks to regain the purchasing power of all public workers For this reason it would be logical and I propose this to you that the fund that you propose should be nourished by unnecessary ideological and political spending savings that are carried out through an analysis of the efficiency of public spending to see where it is wasted In this we can help you a lot from VOX no doubt Moreover absurd situations could arise as defined in the proposal such as the fact that workers with wages little more than three times the inter professional minimum wage were overpaid by others who paid a little less than three times the inter professional minimum wage If we do not deflate the tax bases of the IRPF the disposable income of the benefitted workers would rise less than inflation anyway If we want to increase the disposable income of workers and in VOX we do want to do so without excessively increasing wage costs in order not to produce unemployment or boost the inflationary spiral we must look for other solutions In this way it would seem reasonable despite the government 's indifference to deflate the tax bases of the IRPF to reduce so called contributions of the worker to reduce the so called contributions of the employer and to incorporate such reductions into the gross payroll of the workers on discharge at the time of entry into force without prejudice to other formulas that our group is going to propose shortly regarding the deductibility of the business share in the corporation tax In short ladies and gentlemen wage increases yes of course yes but not so Elie Wiesel Mr Zaragoza I do n't know where Mr Zaragoza who was very impetuous today said that the opposite of love is not hatred but indifference And that 's what the government has done act indifferently with Spanish workers Thank you very much
"Thank you President Good afternoon We welcome the victims with all our affection and respect and we deeply regret that they have had to spend seven years to resolve a mere parliamentary procedure and thus their problem Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Thanks to the tense debate that took place here last week Mrs Nogueras and Mrs Montero learned that the Republican left had agreed on a decent matter And since my VOX Parliamentary Group is not like you who consistently vote not for everything we propose for the mere fact of being VOX we will vote yes to exemption from the payment of the IRPF from orphan children 's scholarships following the Germanwings accident We have lived the pardons to the seditious we have seen how 16 of the budget for autonomous communities is going to stop in Catalonia and suddenly surprise a matter of general interest How many matters left Mr. Rufián Is there any particular relevance that the Spaniards have a right to know This initiative serves as an example for us to demonstrate the diligence with which the governments of the People 's Party and the Socialist Party work and I will tell you why Rajoy promised that these orphans bear no burden for the compensations received then Sánchez promised I guess there was the mistake trusting in who always does just the opposite of what he promises And now Mrs Montero promises it not without first pointing out warmly that the victims are nobody's And it is that the victims of tragedies the victims of traffic accidents and above all the victims of ETA have something in common you do not care at all You care about those victims who make up those oppressed collectives to be able to patrimonialize subsidize and amortize although that gives better to this other minister Montero who is also not present The Minister of Finance is more of On Monday I fix that of the capital gains mayors Do n't worry we 're not going to stop the cash register Why did n't Minister Montero fix this for the weekend Have you not been able to work with the noise that the hundreds of thousands of carriers hunters fishermen farmers farmers and everyone who makes an honest living Have those voices that shouted Government resignation disconcentrated a lot Do n't worry it does n't take much concentration the 800,000 euros that belong to these people who are demanding these orphans and not the Treasury are going to be compensated in excess with the more than 3.5 billion that they are going to enter thanks to the scandalous increase in inflation which they not only do not avoid but also encourage For everyone to understand the Government is delighted that the rise in prices generates an increase in excise and VAT revenues The taxpayer is suffocated by the price of light gas gasoline and commodities And who wins Finance Do you think Mrs Montero is going to adjust the IRPF to inflation to curb the massive impoverishment of the Spanish No that money they want to silence the class unions and continue to subsidize voters Mrs Montero said that the victims are nobody 's and I will answer that all Spaniards are victims of their poor management They are throwing away lords of the PSOE of Podemos and all others they are throwing away all that they have promised them and that they have not fulfilled Those who are now in ruin are telling you loud and clear that they can no longer They have told the Government and they have told Mrs Montero directly that she will return as soon as possible the amounts to these orphans who have never had to pay have a little decency and resign Thank you"
Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen one more year this government allocates the entire expenditure line to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals but most people do not know what that is about the 2030 Agenda the Sustainable Development Goals so I will explain it On the one hand we have the UN summits the climate summit the population summit the education summit A number of conclusions are drawn from these summits and a global consensus is said to have been reached These conclusions are reflected in an agenda the 2030 Agenda which is the solution to all problems On the other hand the UN has a number of agencies the WHO which is dedicated to health UNESCO to education science and culture FAO to food and agriculture the WTO to trade and so on as precisely here the ministries twenty two Some have decided that the UN should act as the World Government it already has its agencies which at a certain point could act as if ministries were involved For example the WHO if there was a pandemic could be the World Health Ministry right Sounds like it to you does n't it So that a world government can exist what needs to be done is to homogenize the world because of course it is chaos that each has its own customs that each has its own religion culture Then there 's another problem and it's that 8 billion people are many people and how are so many people going to be handled Something must be done to handle them for example use a very effective tool the tool of fear because that goes very well for obedience The main excuse is the climate apocalypse The climate apocalypse serves absolutely everything Because moreover man is the culprit man is the culprit he is the only culprit for the climate to change So we 're going to have to change the whole crop system the whole livestock system and with that the whole food system the energy system the industry system we 're going to change the education system We must also reduce the population because so many people pollute a lot And what 's done First what they do is they impoverish us and then they promote abortion gender ideology they create mistrust between couples because all that goes very well to reduce the population Of course borders are very unfair because of course with rising temperatures more than 2 billion people are going to have to emigrate to fresher countries and we have to open borders in pairs because if not we are insolidarians The solution to all evils is in the 2030 Agenda It is a perfect plan to put an end to poverty for affordable energy for decent work and for all goodness but very little is said about the 169 goals that are hidden behind the seventeen goals 193 countries commit to this plan Spain signed this 2030 Agenda at the hands of the People 's Party in 2015 And what are we doing Well we 're turning the agenda into law Everything very sustainable and resilient very inclusive and very gender sensitive Right Irene Montero The one who refuses to obey this agenda or the one who denies the theses of globalism is a negationist and is out of the law Spain obeys because this agenda is designed to dictate the elites of the World Economic Forum those elites who who what a coincidence happen to have interests in the pharmaceutical industry in energy and in food and Pedro Sánchez loves to obey them because that of going to the World Economic Forum he loves they are all his friends What does it mean for Spain to obey this agenda It implies the deconstruction of the society we are seeing it implies an absolute transfer of national sovereignty it implies food dependence it represents the ruin of industry it means above all misery Spain presents general State budgets and allocates 100 per cent of expenditure to the implementation of Agenda 2030 Section 29 Social Rights and Agenda 2030 is an antisocial section and it is because social rights are being able to pay the price of energy and not pass a climate change law that will lead us to ruin and energy dependence A social right is a quality public health it is not neglecting the patients with ALS it is not abandoning the patients with cancer because the treatments are very expensive A social right is care for those who really need help it is not to consider women or the LGBT collective as disabled Social rights are the protection of children and adolescents it is not to cover up the abuse of minors Mrs Montero and it is not to whitewash pederasty Social rights is to help mothers roast forward it is not the promotion of abortion Social rights are a well attended maturity not euthanasia Social rights are safe streets not rapists on the streets Social rights is quality education not indoctrination for the imposition of a single thought Social law is to facilitate access to housing not to protect the Okupas Social rights are food and food sovereignty not hunger and dependence on other countries Social rights are human rights not animal rights Mrs Belarra absent as long as there is only one Spanish passing cold or hungry you have no right to allocate 1760 000 euros in the boost of the 2030 Agenda Minister absent we have the right to dissent we have the right to freedom we have the right to protect our sovereignty to decide on those issues that are crucial to our lives We have the right to break this agenda and get to work for and for Spain You do n't do it Neither will the People 's Party VOX will Thank you
Thank you President Mrs.Belara we ask you to know what measures you are going to put in place to further advance your 2030 Agenda in addition to giving the money of the Spaniards first to impoverish Spain and then to go through Robin Hood 's life in reverse stealing from the Spaniards to give it to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation In addition to that Mrs Belarus we would like to know in order to be prevented what further measures you are going to put in place Let 's talk first about what the 2030 Agenda is The 2030 Agenda as you will know is born under the title of transforming our world 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Well that 's good The truth is that transforming our world sounds pretty good as long as that transformation is for the better not for making a world unsustainable You can change everything that does n't work but the things that do work Mrs. Belarus you have to leave them as they are We do not know who decided these changes and above all we do not know why they want to bring about so much change If we look at the agenda we see that it seems that the excuse is climate change but if we continue to research and analyze the 2030 Agenda it turns out that there are objectives on education on health on gender ideology on justice What does all this have to do with the weather emergency Mrs. Belarra If you ask who chose to make those changes the answer is that there is a global consensus For the truth Mrs Belarus I tell you one thing I know absolutely no one who has been asked about these changes introduced by the 2030 Agenda Of course if you mean that there is a consensus to put an end to poverty to zero hunger to health and well being to clean water and sanitation to decent work to economic growth of course there is a global consensus Everyone wants those things but do you really mean that alone Is the 2030 Agenda just about that We Mrs Belarus when we say that there is no consensus we refer to the recommendations of this agenda and to the goals that you and many other countries are turning into law It is impossible for there to be a global consensus for example in something like educating children in global citizenship I do n't know any father you 've asked if you wanted to educate your children in world citizenship especially because of course if you educate your child in world citizenship what about national citizenship Mrs. Belarus To educate in world citizenship we must renounce our homeland our roots our customs our traditions Do you think it is possible to pretend that a Japanese or an Australian for example have the same vital philosophy as a Spanish Because to me it seems no and you will directly attack just that traditions customs and rooting What a coincidence Above all we have heard from this very rostrum three times to say to three different people New world order Does that sound like you Mrs. Belarra I say this because it was neither me nor anyone from my parliamentary group it was Pedro Sánchez it was Minister Montero who just left and it was Gabriel Rufián It will have nothing to do with that new world order with its 2030 Agenda will it Mrs. Belarus because education for world citizenship new world order seems to have some kind of relationship And of course in order for a new world order to be imposed there will also have to be a global consensus and I do not think Mrs Belarus I do not think we all agree on everything Your ladies and gentlemen in general the People 's Party Podemos and the other independenceist platforms tell us that we are out of the law because we do not agree with the 2030 Agenda I have heard it many times from this rostrum and in the commissions You are out of the law I believed that in a democracy Mrs Belarra one could think differently but it seems not Every time we oppose the slogans of the globalist agenda they call us fascists xenophobes homophobes racists and I do n't know how many more things This Mrs. Belarus can't be understood I 've told you about the title of the 2030 Agenda but now I 'm going to be left alone in the preamble I 'm not going on I 'm going to the preamble The preamble to the agenda says that it aims to strengthen world peace within a broader concept of freedom And then Mrs Belarus why is there a closed debate Is it really to dispel the ideological aspects of this globalist agenda to be out of democracy Is dissension of the ideological aspects of this agenda really out of the law What then does that mean by a broader concept of freedom Mrs. Belarra Just the opposite like everything else Does assuming the global agenda without an option to disagree no longer resemble a dictatorship Mrs Belarra we do not take up the closed debates because there is a lot at stake because we need to talk about our borders because we need to talk about freedom of expression because we need to talk about private property because we need to talk about equality before the law because we need to talk about our language our customs our traditions our history the evil so called gender and we need to talk about identities personal identities and national identities and we need to talk about life and death Mrs Belarra The Spanish have the right to express their views and to decide on those issues that are decisive for their lives and above all have the right to express their views on those issues that are decisive for their children 's lives VOX does not accept this supposed consensus imposed by the World Economic Forum and the UN and does not accept it because these people are no one to decide on the lives of the Spaniards because in the World Economic Forum there is not a single autonomous with difficulties to reach the end of the month because in the World Economic Forum there is no uncertainty about pensions the price of light or the price of gas because there is no one in the World Economic Forum concerned about the shopping basket or the purchase of school material for their children and because the UN whose main mission was the maintenance of peace among nations has fifty seven armed conflicts in the world and is dedicated to getting into the lives of others and is dedicated to putting a global agenda in motion Another of the UN 's missions was the defence of human rights and it turns out that the UN now considers it a human right to crush a child in a maternal womb That 's why we do n't accept the 2030 Agenda because the 2030 Agenda is a wolf with lamb skin After the lamb of health they have hidden the wolf of death after equality the supremacy of women and other collectives after education indoctrination after affordable energy energy poverty after decent work the ERTE after economic growth inflation after the lamb of peace Mrs. Belarus they have hidden the wolf of war This agenda does not respond to patriotic interests it involves a planned destruction of our sovereignty our economy and the moral social and political order Mrs.Belara we ask you to ask what else your ministry is going to do especially to be prevented because as VOX warned from the beginning everything you propose is just the opposite result We were right Do n't you see everything 's going backwards Is there no hunger more than ever Is there no more poverty than ever Where is economic growth Where 's the decent work Have they managed to reduce the deaths of women from domestic violence And what about affordable energy By the way if you look at those countries that are not part of the 2030 Agenda you will see that their economy is much better than those that are But I know what you 're going to answer I know the virus Putin and the climate You are going to tell me that the climate has been responsible for the fires and that the impositions of the 2030 Agenda have nothing to do with it you are going to tell me that Putin is solely responsible for the price of gas and for the widespread price of commodities and of course he is going to tell me that the virus has generated the economic crisis and that it has nothing to do with the impositions of the 2030 Agenda It 's over Mrs. Belarra The world is turning to another direction Only this month Chile has kicked that globalist Constitution Italy has said that no to the 2030 Agenda and Spain sooner than later by the hand of VOX will also escape from the clutches of globalism Mrs. Belarus this agenda is a bad plan and has no good intentions We deserve rulers fully committed to the prosperity and well being of Spanish and non-governors dedicated to achieving global goals that go against our interests Abandon all hope of further progress towards the destruction of the family our customs and traditions Do not continue to make progress towards the ruin of industry trade fishermen farmers farmers and self employed Leave the children alone and get to work for the Spaniards who are paying them because Spain has not come here so that a millionaire club imposes a global dictatorship In Spain there is a social and patriotic movement called VOX full of women and men free solvent independent courageous willing to defend Spain until the last consequences women and men fully dedicated to the search for the common good And I end with a phrase from Thomas Jefferson The biggest patriot is the dissident because above the political interest what he wants is prosperity and freedom for the nation It 's patriot time Thank you
"Thank you President Mrs. Belarra I 'm no conspirator I have come up here to tell you that this agenda is a planned destruction of our sovereignty our economy and the moral social and political order And I 'm telling you because the data there has it it has all of Spain it 's not that I say it it 's that You have said that it is a social democratic agenda and at the same time that it is an agenda of consensus How is it possible that it is a consensus agenda if it is a social democratic agenda He also reminded me and I thank him that it was the People 's Party that adhered to this 2030 Agenda Yes of course I do If that 's why we say there 's only VOX left because you 're all on the side of globalism Then he told me about the minimum living wage Of course I understand that I do n't talk about the agenda your Ministry is Social Rights and Agenda 2030 and you go to social rights which I have n't told you anything about social rights But it 's not right either it 's the government 's star measure and it turns out that on June 1 comes into force as you know better than anyone else Decree 2020 of 29 May which was expected to reach 840,000 households and 2 300 000 people And the reality is that as of today it has not reached half a million households and we go for 1,200 000 people I mean that social shield you 're talking about is n't going very well either You have come up here to boast of abortion and affective sexual education Mrs. Belarus are n't you able to understand that there are people we 're saying that it's us who want to talk to our children about sex and decide when when and what to talk to our children about Mrs. Belarra the children are from the parents Is he going to be your son or is he going to be state Hey Mrs. Belarus whose son are you going to have From the State from Mrs Celaá from the 2030 Agenda What we 're saying is that we have the right as parents to decide the sexual and affective education of our children and that 's no conspiracy okay In short radical feminism salon ecology and what they are doing is destroying Spain and spending and spending and spending on advertising in order to impose global communism You spend 6 million euros in the Directorate General for Animal Rights to put it in the hands of people who have not stepped on the field in their lives and who have no idea what an animal is And I 'm going to warn you one thing from here Mrs. Belarra forget that this animal welfare law comes forward neither that animal welfare law nor any other barbarity that comes out of the 2030 Agenda Nothing more"
"Thank you President The 2030 Agenda is the Trojan horse of postcommunism Let 's go with what we call conspiracy Spain does not deserve that in the face of this food crisis farmers cannot grow food not just because of a question of quotas but because some billionaire claims to be the world 's only food supplier Here it is 100,000 hectares and adding Bill Gates is raising the largest agricultural empire in the United States We continue Spain does not deserve a billionaire club to decide to demonize meat to favor its synthetic food businesses Here it is Bill Gates Rich nations should start eating synthetic meat Spain also does not deserve that families cannot pay for energy because a group of billionaires who do not speak Spanish have forbidden us to explore and exploit our natural resources Here it is Bill Gates and Warren Buffett invest in nuclear megaprojects to revolutionize energy Spain does not deserve Pedro Sánchez to give EUR 130 million to Bill Gates Here it is Pedro Sánchez donates 130 million to an entity founded by Bill Gates Nor do we deserve the 2030 Agenda 's impositions to force parents to clean up the garbage that some school children bring because educators mislead them Here it is Get a girl and a child out of class to simulate a blowjob Spain has not come this far so that the Government will become the censor authoritarian irresponsible father and supplier of misery instead of doing what it has to do which is to promote prosperity and give service to the Spaniards and that communism needs poor to remain in power We thought there was nothing more dangerous than the PSOE about to lose an election but there is it 's the PSOE supported by communists and parties who want to break Spain They took us to the edge of the cliff This post communist agenda involves the widespread impoverishment of the population the liquidation of the sovereignty of nations and is a frontal attack on the families life and roots of the West We therefore urge the Government to immediately cease blind obedience to this agenda that has not been designed to improve the lives of the Spaniards We urge you to give us a voice to decide whether we want a Spain that is confronted and with indignant inequalities between regions or a State that serves unity and solidarity between territories We have to decide whether we want a Spain blackmailed by separatists or a united and strong Spain the lie of historical memory and the black legend or the true contribution of Spain to the history and protection of national identity We must decide whether to destroy jobs or create jobs The time has come to decide whether we will continue to consent to the demonization of the rural world or whether we will defend hunting bulls our customs and traditions We must choose between eating meat or eating worms climate fanaticism and green policies that ruin the countryside or the care of the traditional environment energy dependence and the ruin of families or the conservation and construction of power plants that provide us with energy sovereignty continuing attacks on or protection of private property a justice tailored to bipartisanism or a depoliticized and real justice We must decide between the effect called on the criminals of the world or organized immigration of quality and defense of our borders an environment of distrust between men and women and criminal asymmetry or harmony real equality and reparation for constitutional rights No woman in Spain should face the drama of aborting because she does not find support for motherhood We do not want the imposition of perverted morale in schools we want the freedom of parents to choose the education that best suits and that best matches their values and principles Either we protect the wolf who kills the whole flock to eat a lamb or we protect the wolf 's flock In front of the culture of death life in front of the gag the word in front of the censorship of the dissident democracy in front of the wolf of Agenda 2030 SantiagoAbascal and its Agenda Spain Spain deserves to be able to decide Thank you"
With your permission Mr. President The motion they present is based on at least highly questionable assumptions the anthropocentric origin of climate change If not the climate emergency that permeates all its political action that of progressive consensus would fall to them like a castle of cards They call it climate religion but I see them more as a sect an inquisitorial sect in which the dissident is socially canceled They annihilate hope and young activists have appeared who dedicate themselves to cultural alter terrorism in museums In order to generate more panic we are told that this crisis precedes the one caused by the Putin war and that it is of scarcity that we have already reached the peak of oil production Geologist Marion King Hubbert predicted it in 1956 for the year 1970 Campbell for the year 2000 and however in 2016 it consumed more than twice as much oil as in 2000 Can it not be that the decrease in the discovery of new deposits is due to the lack of prospecting by oil companies which no longer see these investments profitable in a decarbonized and fanatized world Europe accounts for 10 of global CO2 emissions of which Spain is only 0.7 while China alone represents a third and has neither come to COP 27 nor India or Russia Only Europe substantially lowers its emissions and the recent climate change law of 2021 seems to them little Have you asked in the oil complex of Tarragona what consequences their occurrences will have They threaten us with an apocalyptic future and sell us as progress the renunciation of the private vehicle when it has been a conquest of freedom for the middle and working class What do Lérida 's paychecks think of having to buy an electric tractor within ten years Do you see it possible They tell us about a fair transition and the Spaniards do not trust they know of the false promises in the mining basins and that only the abandonment was left Of the thermal plants blown by the air suspect that they will run the same fate The current state of Zorita 's nuclear power plant is an example Before 600 people worked today 50 and they 're waiting for full dismantling They have been unable to create new jobs Their progress is as bleak as the shirts they come to Parliament with They 've lost ethics and aesthetics They want to go further behind the Spain of the 600 and remember You will have nothing and you will be happy On the basis of renewables alone it is impossible to maintain the current level of energy consumption by collecting a diffuse energy which is the sun unpredictable like the wind the ecological footprint will be much higher We are not negatists just agnostics of their climate blind faith and therefore demand prudence and preserve a varied energy mix A varied mix is to include to a large extent photovoltaic and wind but respecting the landscape and landscape and to enhance solar self consumption and distributed generation We proposed in the climate change law a land management to place renewables and conserve land use to farmers and livestock farmers and avoid speculation speculation that the minister recognized on this same stand the day he answered them as well as recognized the lack of energy storage so we demand the transformation of dams into pumping reservoirs and that they be a condition in the new leaflets of the concessions that will expire A varied mix would be not only to conserve nuclear power but to invest in the future with small modular reactors which revitalized a Spanish nuclear sector that is still leading the world and will consume irradiated fuel so it makes no sense to build a deep geological storage as announced in the seventh waste plan Rectify and build the ATC which is optimal in security and have the site and the money collected million dollar investments in studies and accesses already made Thus the construction of the hot cells that Zorita needs will be saved first of all when the reactor safe is dismantled There is no sense in seven warehouses scattered throughout Spain and less if the power stations are closed A reasonable mix is not to prohibit prospecting studies and take advantage of Spain 's resources of radioactive minerals and hydrocarbons Thus the Spanish will have energy at a reasonable price and not the energy poverty with which they seem to have resigned VOX will work tirelessly to stop Sanchez 's blow Thank you very much
"With your permission President The Constitutional Court ruled twice in the years 2016 and 2019 that the tax intended to be doubled by the Government of Sánchez was unconstitutional There was still no timetable for nuclear closure so there was no need in neo linguage for a just transition The compensation proposed in the regions that have suffered from the closure of coal mining or thermal power plants has been an absolute disappointment The example of the closure of Garoña ten years ago has meant only the construction of a small pier still without boats and houses of rural tourism while 1,200 megawatts of photovoltaic projects are requested that will create a landscape that is not compatible with the tourism If you really want to secure a future for the surroundings of Vandellós and Ascó what you must do is build Vandellós II and Ascó II We have proposed to reopen Garoña with a new modular reactor It is impossible to replace the six hundred jobs he had with fair transition plans In the year 2020 the third is the end the Generality established a tax disguised of ecologicalism tax on the installations that affect the environment they called it Sánchez said he would appeal to the Constitutional Court but he did n't dare It contravened the pact signed a year earlier between the electricians Enresa and the Government which established the closing schedule for the seven nuclear reactors a fund for the management of radioactive waste and seemed to provide a definitive tax framework For VOX this autonomous tax means double taxation which violates inter alia the principle of economic capacity and the right to freedom of enterprise enshrined in articles 31 and 33 of the Constitution It is confiscatory in nature with this tax they suffocate the generation of almost 60 of the electricity of Catalonia In April 2022 insatiable the tax went up and VOX appealed it to the Constitutional Court one of the 44 unconstitutionality appeals on the Sánchez package the set of secret agreements signed with the enemies of Spain Sánchez 's pack tries to bring irrevocable ages closer to the Basque Country to pardon the coupsmen of the process to promulgate the ideological legislacies that no one claimed such as Lomloe that of abortion the law of Herod euthanasia yes is that of historical memory that of citizen security the decriminalization of the insults to the king and of course to make life impossible for the nuclear industry to shut down itself This Government is clearly hostile to all nuclear matters Eco-friendly night before the fall of the wall of its preferred partner makes them ignore a leading industry that exports 70 of its activity to more than forty countries For example we produce nuclear fuel rods exporting more than half to countries such as Belgium France Sweden or Finland The control rooms of 21 nuclear power plants are being exported to China The U.S. aviation industry purchases ultrasonic systems and materials fatigue detection developed by Tecnatom The Spanish nuclear industry collaborates in the design of several SMRs around the world The national industry would account for 80 of the construction programmes for a new reactor in Spain That is the challenge we should be facing rather than wasting time trying to convince this government of the need to start the Villar de Cañas warehouse at once or to convince of the strategic value of our last seven reactors which provide Spain with 20 of electricity and stabilize the grid being a rotating energy They are the same as in the United States which has extended its service life to 80 years The sixth generation of coming reactors cool down alone in case of shutdown In addition they are safer and cheaper while being modular being able to quickly increase their power so they can serve as a back up to renewables and use as fuel much of the radioactive waste generated by the current ones It is no use reminding this government of the 27 000 stable and quality jobs of the Spanish nuclear industry Nor does it correct the Government with which the taxonomy of the European Union has included it as green energy or with which Germany changes and does not close its last three reactors This Government says over and over again that nuclear energy is the past and only the reality of the nuclear boom being produced is being denied together with the 450 nuclear power plants in operation the construction of 483 new ones has been announced Sánchez has turned the world around eight times in Falcon but it has not been realized that 37 countries with 5 billion inhabitants such as the United States France and so on are building nuclear power plants Thank you very much"
Thank you Madam President These days they have big surprises for us Yesterday came a member of the Unidad Podemos with the sickle and the hammer and today they are claiming Václav Havel and in addition ET It seems to us that living with you must be quite a surprise it must be a real scare Finally it must be very difficult to make budgets with these ideological vavenes persuading them These budgets brought by the Government show that their only interest is the elections that await us Since Pedro Sánchez arrived in Moncloa there are one million more people who have lowered the poverty line The queues of social eaters are getting longer even many of our friends are having to close their shops in our cities Therefore the fact that we meet with this amount of money dedicated to the personal benefit of the President of the Government cannot fail to cause us a great rejection With this way of using public money I now truly understand that the condemnation of the corrupt in Andalusia has seemed so bad to them A budget for the Ministry of Culture and Sport of 1804 million euros 1804 million should be a great joy for all of us This is a large amount of money that could correct a large number of problems in the cultural sectors of our country However the fact of rewarding your allies has meant that instead of serving the public interest we are in debt to keep you in government which seems to us to be a double punishment for Spain Since we have the European funds we have warned of the difficulties of managing them It is very difficult to prevent a part of the European funds being returned it has historically happened in Spain That is why it was essential to have the right staff to manage them and that has not been done We have been saying this for three years we told your predecessor three years ago we told you and the people who came to the Commission last year and yet nothing has been done about it The funds for staff have been increased but for other staff not for whom it is precisely necessary to help them manage European funds After the collapse of the PSOE 's electoral expectations among the young population they launched the cultural bonus program We indicated to them that the design of this cultural bonus was absurd because Gabi the player from Barcelona 18 years old would be able to have access to that bonus and yet a 16 year old or 20 year old from Las Tres Mil Híviendas or Las Palmeras in Córdoba would not have access which made people who did not need that bonus at all benefit while others who did need it urgently could not have access to it You told us that you would improve the design of the bonus in successive calls However nothing has changed at all from the design of the bonus Moreover they have rebudgeted the same amount of the previous year 210 million euros although they already know at this point that they are going to spend a little more than half of the budget last year in which they budgeted the same so it seems to us that they could make much better use of the money In the sports sector we have a budget of 315 million euros which in its ordinary budget is 208 million 7 million more than last year That 7 million euros more is going to go straight to women 's sport which is fine They put 5 million euros to launch the Women 's Professional Football League However we have the problem that we have an inflation of 9 in 2022 which means that in real terms investment in sport in Spain is going to decrease a very large amount of money Because the whole increase is given to funds that are for very specific programmes special programmes that are to be seen to be carried out That is why we believe that these budgets pose great dangers to the future of our sports and cultural sectors And do n't tell us you 're running it because even your Republican Left partners in Catalonia are telling you that not all these programs are running properly These budgets had no arrangement from the beginning it was impossible to amend them however those who have tried and tabled amendments have learned in their own right that they only served for the fun of this group of sectarians who have drawn up this budget However I believe that the Spanish deserve to know what this money should be devoted to This money should be dedicated to recovering the more than 1100 monuments on the list of Hispania Nostra that are threatened Monuments whose collapse makes us a third world country This money should have been dedicated to financing research in archaeological sites which have barely been excavated and which we have many archaeological fields throughout Spain That money should have been devoted to promoting the development of audiovisual sectors without sectarianism and without electoralism They should have made things easier for cultural entrepreneurs Theater entrepreneurs are paying VAT that is not paid by national theatres and it seems to us that this is unfair competition and that should not be allowed Entrepreneurs in the world of sports gyms are having great problems because all the tax rebate requests we have made have been rejected We should really invest in high performance centres and not just half a million euros in these budgets They should have improved our presence in Hispanic speaking countries in Europe and in the United States because it is essential that our cultural markets be expanded in order to achieve a size that allows them to be profitable And there are many other things to which this money should have been devoted money that we hope the Spaniards can see in the future general budgets of the state when they can forget this ghost government and these budgets of ruin Thank you very much Madam President
Thank you Madam President A few days ago the Cabildo de Gran Canaria by decision of Podemos and the PSOE vetoed at the III Women and Sport State Congress the specialist in sports law Irene Aguiar using his appearance in the Committee of Culture and Sport of this Congress to justify this veto It is not only an attack on freedom of expression but also an attack on the dignity of the Congress of Deputies itself If what a person holds in a Commission can be used to eliminate it from public life in Spain no one will of course give any testimony other than that which the Government likes in any Commission or anywhere But this gentlemen of the PSOE and Podemos who have perpetrated this matter cannot be called democracy They have introduced in Spain the culture of cancellation and the culture of censorship Aguiar has been vetoed for expressing opinions shared by many historical feminists of the PSOE The fact that they are imposing the criterion of a part of their leaders on the whole country is an obvious sign of sectarianism and is something that sooner than later they will pay very dearly In order to prepare our position before this law we were gathered with a great many sportsmen clubs federations and experts in sports law and the amendments that we tabled moved the concerns of much of the world of sport These amendments revolve around a number of crucial issues First it is necessary to ensure that the participation of people with a male physical constitution does not destroy women 's sport This does not logically mean that trans people cannot compete in sport it means that they cannot achieve a decisive advantage that ends up eliminating that female sport and ends up blurring the boundaries between male and female sport Women 's sport is currently on the rise around the world but it is clear that this Government prefers to sell itself to the delusions and hallucinations of its partners to stay on the couch Some international federations have taken letters on the matter such as that of Swimming after the case of Lia Thomas In this case a person who was ranked number 462 in male swimming became a gold medal in female swimming in the United States After this letters have been taken in the matter to prevent cases such as this from continuing to harm the rights of athletes However many other federations have not done so With this law athletes will be unprotected and in an inequality of conditions that will in many cases lead them to abandon what they have had to fight for In order to avoid this we have tabled various amendments such as the 709 according to which participation in sports competitions when divided by sex must be made according to biological sex No group has supported this amendment I repeat none The group has supported this amendment which is of mere common sense demonstrating that for the defense of women 's sport as for so many things only VOX remains Secondly a relevant case is that of the TAD the Administrative Court of Sport which had allowed free access and quick decisions on many sports issues so that for example the promotion or descent of sports clubs did not have to wait for years for a court ruling When those decisions were taken by the TAD they arrived more or less quickly when they had to wait for a judicial decision as in the case of the Obradoiro they arrived very late and in some cases there was no possibility of amending the damage suffered For this reason sporting cases will flood the courts of our country in the coming years and when the PSOE joins the history books to the socialist parties of Italy or Greece the next government will have to solve a problem like the one you are leaving you today Thirdly the protection of small clubs in the ecosystem of professional leagues and federations The clubs announced their opposition to this law and only one last minute amendment avoided a strike However we believe that the whole of the article can lead to serious discussions in the courts and that that is not to provide security for our sport Fourthly the conditions of athletes and technicians The situation had changed radically over 1990 and we felt that much more attention was needed The Government has referred us to the status of the athlete However we have to say that seeing what happened with the artist 's status applied to droplets since 2018 this was the time to have discussed this matter The amendment that PSOE and PNV have agreed on to Article 44 which opens the door to the participation of autonomous elections in international competitions is another of those occasions when the gentlemen of the PSOE talk with the sovereignty of the Spanish people You have allyed yourselves with those who publicly seek to break Spain Even some who have shared with you other kinds of madness have had to withdraw from support of this law in the face of this savagery The independenceists have done two things in which they have a lot of practice to take the PSOE measures with which to leverage against our country against Spain and to use sport for propaganda purposes This law has given them both and I hope that every mayor and councillor of the PSOE throughout Spain will know that they have been made accomplices of a betrayal By the way gentlemen of Together you know that you are the pagantas of this government because you have given them nothing and in spite of that A sports law is a need that everyone has gathered and if it had been approached in a less sectarian way it could have enjoyed a great deal of support
However the PSOE 's desire to support federative caciques of their rope and the delusions of their partners have surpassed the public interest and the defense of the common good We cannot support a law that will create more problems than it will solve Thank you Madam President
Madam President ladies and gentlemen Minister I have to start with Mr Serna Are you sure you 're from Murcia Because if I were from Murcia I would know that those who opposed women 's scholarships are two people expelled from VOX and therefore do not represent our party there in Murcia Let 's see if you were born in another autonomous community As for what you mentioned on personal matters I will tell you that when Mr. Pablo Iglesias insinuated that Ana Botella Mr. Aznar 's wife was there because she was Mr. Aznar 's wife you did not tear your clothes or say anything at all It is that you have very fine skin for your own things and very hard for others Minister as everyone knows universities have several ways of financing firstly academic fees which amount to approximately 25 secondly current transfers from the Government and the autonomous communities in the form of grants or aid granted by the Government without direct consideration thirdly property income income from property ownership fourthly disposal by sale of property fifthly transfers etc The bulk of this income is found in the rates paid by families and in the current transfers of the Government and the autonomous communities and as is natural as is already the case in Spanish public education inequality is the predominant note however much you gentlemen of the sinister strive to come here presenting yourself as champions of equality It turns out that the funding per student and year of a Basque university is 60 higher than that of an extremist or mortian university As always as always the Basque Country is at the head Again and again the different governments of Spain reward the regions that threaten national unity and punish those that remain loyal to this unity and above all according to article 55 of the law of the university system you will ask the autonomous communities to invest 1 of the gross domestic product in university financing It is obvious that those with fiscal benefits and greater economic development will have healthier universities thus deepening their policies in the inequality of the Spanish So do n't come up with stories of equality and equity The underfunded regions like mine Murcia to which I do not know if Mr Serna really belongs are punished in these budgets scanning investments as the CROEM has already denounced
"or diverting the planned funds for infrastructure to other autonomous communities We assume that you will have to deduct that 1 of other investments of your own from the autonomous community The budgets of the Ministry of Universities are the ashes of the general budgets and it is the crucial experiment that shows that this social government can operate at a propaganda blow The reality that more and more Spaniards are getting to know is that you who talk about collecting taxes to finance health and education what you do is have collapsed health and a second divisional education where there is no equity and where indoctrination takes precedence over knowledge At the same time that the subsidies for trade unions are increasing that you are raising your wages that you are building a government so populated that you laugh at the Marx brothers quarters or that you invest 590 million in the absurd ineffective and even harmful Ministry of Equality it turns out that the university gives 441 million that is 22 million less than in the past year Above all the UNED budget reduces it by 7.5 million And for greater scorn the only budget items are those devoted to propaganda which increases by 264 propaganda aimed at advertising each and every one of the mantras of the fundamentalist left climate fanaticism gender ideology hysterical memory etc And another common place you 've mentioned is scholarships which say they 're a subjective right which does n't matter the notes Students at the university are allowed to enrol in half of the credits corresponding to a course of study and of this half they have the option of a scholarship approving in the most demanding of cases 65 In other words one student has a scholarship approving three out of ten subjects that constitute a course The demagogic argument you use that this is for equal opportunities to fall by its own weight because in addition you generate comparative grievances that are terrible It turns out that take note a student who belongs to a family of three members who enters 32,967 euros and who approves three of ten subjects has a scholarship but a student who belongs to a family of three members who earns 44 euros more per year is not entitled to a scholarship even if he approves all subjects Fairness fairness in the distribution of scholarships There is a fundamental reason why this social government may decide to consider scholarships as a subjective right and to absurdly lower academic criteria and this reason is the result of its crude and disastrous ideology For you the university is an end in itself and not a means to work out a professional future or for research They 've turned certain faculties into sinister activist training centers There are faculties in which it is difficult to discern whether one is in an educational center or in a headquarters in Podemos If it was quite common to meet high school students with their scarapela and tambourine singing the Clavelitos already at forty forty years old now what we see are not tunas but tunates who are dedicated to making scrapes who disguise themselves as poor and who instead of the tambourine and the Clavelitos carry the dog the flute and the Bella Ciao but still are social parasites at the service of governmental ideology I 'm going to finish because I do n't have time Mr. Serna has taken a lot away from me You do not welcome the fact that we are not making partial amendments because we do not like to work Look the amendments aim to fix some aspects of a law clean or enhance those that are right and modify those that are wrong That is why it is good that I remind you of a Lao Tse ruling which is immediately applicable to these budgets of ruin and in general to all the ideological laws with which you have punished us in this legislature Lao Tse says you can't clean a wall made of manure the wall we tear down Thank you very much"
President ladies and gentlemen Minister you see that when the independence and separatist groups want to improve a national law it is precisely in order to further deepen their quest for independence you know who the rooms are playing with You will know that the university is a Latin rooted concept that points to what is universal precisely that is why it is called university and not particularity that has its core in Greek schools in Aristotelian high school or in the Platonic academy and as a matter of essence it is basically the search for truth this search for truth that the Greeks called philosophy the search for knowledge These schools also developed during the Roman period the Proculletana and Sabinian schools of Roman law Sabiniana has nothing to do with the racist and xenophobic founder of the Basque Nationalist Party and not with Joaquín Sabina And then the universalizing explosion of medieval universities led by scholastics the University of Paris the University of Salamanca the University of Coimbra to the present universities especially the Anglo Saxons where the most innovative sciences and technologies are studied Universities have historically deployed an essence a nucleus that is the search I insist for truth but the Spanish university has long dragged a degeneration of this essence that within the limit to which this harmful law contributes produces a transformation of that universal essence of truth itself into a different genre of ideological and particularist character Endogamy the lack of means the devaluation of content the gross pragmatism and fundamentally ideology have been the causal agents of this degeneration which has led to the absence of any Spanish university among the best in the world With this law the transformation of the universal in particular is already almost irreversible the conversion of the university into another instrument for the implementation of an official ideology that instead of defending itself dialectically against others is canonized in the legislative texts and uses extortion insult and slavery as the only form of defense The ideology of the fundamentalist left with its climate fanaticism its feminism and contradictoryly to that feminism the theories of gender its inclusive language its political correctness its puritanism combined with contempt for effort study authority and academic excellence replace the truth and cancel the debate Thus this law no longer guarantees the right to education When students call a strike or rather a parody of a strike of those that their subsidized associations promote when they do not govern you will they have students who want to go to class right to be able to enter Because what comes out of the law does n't seem to be By the same rule they award scholarships to mediocre students who only approve 25 of the credits you want to ensure a perfect activist factory An ideology yours that no longer seeks the truth but supports the power of elites who seek to end the canonical nations and turn citizens into subjects of a new order supposedly progressive and in rigor completely regressive Because the model you are pursuing separatist gentlemen is a neo -feudal model and that has nothing advanced In their search for universality medieval universities for example used Latin as a free language which allowed interconnection between them which allowed a Spanish scholastic such as Juan Caramuel to defeat Descartes because Descartes had written his metaphysical meditations in Latin and Caramuel understood it perfectly After the French Revolution and the emergence of political nations with their national languages English and Spanish maintained this universality that frank language character that allowed the development of research programs in two connected areas the Angloosphere and the Spanishosphere remnants of the empires that make up our contemporary world When with this law the separatist social government intends to break the already precarious unity of the single university district encouraging classes publications research to be done exclusively in the regional languages are they not attacking the same universality that the university defends Are n't they using college to break up with what 's common to propitiate the breakup Is it not a new attack on the university district that from this law it is the autonomous communities that set the prices of academic fees And how do you rate that with this law labor personnel are allowed to take the position of rector All the reforms contained in this law are aimed at weakening the university system Undoubtedly as is already the case in Hispano America with propaganda for pre-Columbian languages this linguistic apartheid of Spanish is an instrument for breaking the Hispanicity of our transatlantic ties but also for breaking our nation With this panorama I would ask you to make an effort of coherence and at least to stop calling university what is no longer universal but a ram of the promotion of particularism of villageism and of the disappearance of Spain as a political nation In the logic of preaching affirmative universal propositions have as contradictory proposition the negative particulars Particular and negative is his law they deny the nation deny Spanish deny academic excellence and deny the truth Explain yourself to the Spanish university students of Castilla Aragon Andalusia Extremadura Cantabria or Murcia but also to the Argentine students Peruvians Venezuelans etc. who will not be able to study or work in the Basque Country Galicia Catalonia Valencia or Balearics and will add some more with the bable and these things because you have decided that knowledge truth and universality are less important than the destruction of Spain and the re-conception of the only universal language of our mischievous nation in order to establish a feudal regime in the service of separatist and globalist oligarchies Thank you very much
President ladies and gentlemen Minister you started with a quote from a book by Crozier that says Society is not changed by decree I completely agree but you will completely agree that your Government is constantly trying to change society by decree and not just society they are also trying to change reality to accommodate its ideological dogmas I will explain here an old theory which is the theory of the suspicion of the philosophers of the 19th because when I read the joint I have to suspect that behind the good words are hidden avious intentions as suspected Freud Marx or Nietzsche They literally say that the end of this project is to ensure an autonomous democratic and participatory university which constitutes an area of freedom cultural debate and personal development and at the same time is effective and efficient in decision making and its management but it is that we already know what this Government and its allies mean by cultural debate that it is to prevent with violent squabbles that enter the university any political approach that opposes the official ideology that pseudo religion of the progressive left woke and its identity logomaquias that permeate the entire document Thus in Article 2 you include democratic memory or the fight against climate change in Article 18 you speak of sustainable development in Article 4.3 of gender equality in all university activities in Article 44.5 you establish gender parity without regard to merit in Article 43.2 you speak of the creation of equality and diversity units in all universities in Article 46.2 you speak of gender equality etc As is already the case in its disastrous primary secondary and high school themes all its dogmas now become the official doctrine of universities feminism gender theories that turn their backs on the biological reality of sexual dimorphism climate fanaticism inclusive language globalism and relentless persecution of those who dare to disagree That 's what you call in your Orwellian neolingua the space of freedom Space of freedom yes but only for its activists and only for those who impose their ideology on the university They call cultural debate to attack any ideological antithesis through the process of encapsulating these arguments with disqualifying adjectives Thus everyone who opposes these items of the left woke becomes facha nazi homophobo macho reactionary that is an adjective discourse not a substantive discourse In this way the university which should be the intellectual training temple of the nation becomes the factory of semi-alphabet activists who properly educated and bought with scholarships that do not reward the effort and the approved because you have declared them a subjective right that is established only on the basis of economic criteria constitute a force of shock against common sense against the minimum political rationality necessary for a just social order It has been a long time since this sluggish extravagant and anti-national left has used the university to obtain through deception coercion slavery and propaganda demonizing the adversary most of all my political party taking advantage of the need and lack of preparation that young people carry after a practically secondary education and a poor baccalaureate of only two years The fundamentalist and anti-national lefts represent the official ideology of the globalist and separatist elites and have no more function in this social order that impoverishes workers that attacks families that devilizes life in the popular neighborhoods consenting to crime occupation of housing insecurity and illegal immigration than to turn school and university into an immense ideological trap aimed at young people seeing a distorted reality and accepting their ideological fallacy The globalist and anti-Spanish lefts far from the real problems of the nation prefer individuals who lack knowledge and are easily manipulated This is why they replace the history of Spain with a hysterical false and partial memory therefore instead of objective knowledge they offer students ideological content identity schemes collectivization and substitution of rational debate by swallowing into emotional and sensitive content For you it is a priority to sweeten the students to remove them from the critical and philosophical knowledge of the real to become activists who content themselves with the zoological works that the elites to whom you do the dirty work offer them in the form of a minimum income unjust scholarships that do not reward the effort established as a subjective right and therefore granted to the margin of objective criteria such as the student 's academic performance His interest is rather in having deans and rectors like his ideology that justify the slavery and violent attacks on teachers lecturers or student associations such as S'ha Finet who do not commune with his creed We have seen I acknowledge an effort to clarify the recruitment system We hope that this effort will help not to hire a person to teach in Complute for the merit of being the wife of the President of the Government This project also constitutes a new attack on national unity by disconnecting from what has to do with the problem of Spain its identity and those political programmes aimed at its survival within the framework of a terrible dialectic of States like this to which we are subjected under the heading of a false and deceptive internationalism of the university an internationalism contradictory to certain norms included here such as for example the empowerment of vernacular languages of co-official languages Are you going to talk to the French and English in Basque or in bable Of course this will have to be with the imposition of English because with these languages we cannot talk about internationalization But you have not included the approval of the titles either If the university is to be internationalised the first thing will be to have a clear rule allowing for the approval of titles In fact what is hidden under this internationalism is Spain 's submission to the globalist dictates and the loss of sovereignty and with the excuse of enhancing the co-official languages they enhance the dismemberment of the nation in taifas in feuds that limit the mobility of Spanish university students and promote the rupture of a single university district by imposing these languages on students In short under the disguise of cosmopolitanism and autonomy assumes the real project where only the elites the new feudal lords have political rights and the citizens are reduced to their status as subjects A new order where every form of dissent is persecuted demonized with its adjective and false speeches a new order of Orwellian coloration as in 1984 the book of Orwell Moreover this preliminary draft lacks rational guidance to clarify the procurement systems Nor does it clarify the funding It is true that there will now be dual funding because the autonomous communities have to be involved in financing up to 1 which by the way will mean that universities in fiscally favoured autonomous communities will also have more opportunity to devote more funding to the university which will further deepen the Spanish division as already happens in high school and high school where students and teachers in the Basque Country have more investment per year and also earn more money This deepens much more in the division of the Spaniards and goes against a single university district In addition to not clarifying this funding in that deleterious wording we have only made clear what you want to harden the requirements for the establishment of private universities which are very typical of the socialist government The same thing that happens with concerted education in the field of middle education is now transferred to the field of private universities which are the refuge of many people fleeing this indoctrination that you also want to impose at the university In changing the matter there is also no known economic memory that would allow us to know the credits for a new funding model or for the multi-annual plans that facilitate the new figures that they have created this psycho- pedagogical accompaniment vocational guidance In economic memory we do n't see how this is going to be financed if you can you 'll explain it to me later The proposal to include the Autonomous Communities in the funding will as I said widen the gap between universities and does not include the procedure for the approval of qualifications All these reasons lead us to present an amendment to the whole that is mainly based on this interest that you have contrary to your first sentence to regard society as something manipulated and designed according to the government What they have to do is let society itself create its own ways of life and survival What they have to do is to facilitate a quality university that at last there is a Spanish university among the best in the world For that they have to be the best in university and for that there has to be a single university district and a university aimed at overcoming the very serious economic problems that we are going through at promoting science critical thinking and not what we have today which is an ideological pastiche aimed at giving propaganda to a completely irrational ideology which is opposed not only to common sense but also to the opinions of the sciences themselves When you include gender theory while feminism commits a profound contradiction because both theories are incompatible and I do n't tell you they call it classic feminists You can't please everyone The university has to be the factory of knowledge it has to be oriented to the labor market and not to the promulgation of careers that they encounter with their students in unemployment but that is very well educated to serve you as a ram and political activism Nothing more Thank you very much
Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen the Royal Decree regulating the ESO curriculum has been published today The first news we have had according to an ABC publication of your impact memory is that you have rejected the request made to you by the Directorate General of Support for Victims of Terrorism to study terrorism as one more issue within the area of Geography and History They have also been against the proposal of the Ministry of Defence which proposed adding the Civic and Ethical Education collection the Culture and National Security collection However they have listened to Mrs Montero tan feminist who has asked them to censor the musical compositions I read textually which could contain components relating to the myths of romantic love in which a differential and complementary conception of men and women is assumed I mean at this point the bowlers are going to turn out to be part of the song protesting against the system with these things that you have But it is that moreover in this curriculum you say that you are going to remove the chronological sense of history Minister if history is taken away from you the chronology is no longer history it will be something else that is indoctrination which is what you claim pure and hard indoctrination And I do n't tell you the Spanish Royal Academy of History tells you which accuses you in its opinion of presentism and of using history to publicize your famous memory which you now call democratic because it seems that those leaders of the Popular Front were fighting for democracy when there is nothing more to see than their declarations to know that what they intended to do was to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat you put yourselves as you put yourselves on But it is that moreover you have skipped a unanimous agreement that there was here in this House in 2018 to include Philosophy in Compulsory Secondary Education you have replaced it with this Education for Citizenship 2.0 which as I say is pure indoctrination The historical perspective you change from a gender perspective Look you 're going to allow me a galeate tour because I know where I 'm going to come from that if homophobia that if machism that if and what Look we are opposed to gender theory for the same reasons and the same reasons why we are opposed to explaining in Secondary the nigromancy voodoo or any scientific theory such as phrenology etc. because it lacks a scientific basis Moreover the arguments against this theory I do not give them if you want Mrs Montero has gone I give you the arguments of classical feminists of the PSOE and of the United Left like Mrs Amelia Valcárcel who has just extended a published book called Nobody is born in a wrong body Mr Errasti and Mr Marino Pérez And also Mrs. Lidia Falcon founder of the Spanish Feminist Party who says the following Gender theory is a fantasy fiction an ideological roughness And Mrs Falcon describes the trans lobby not me as a mutant sect And then before the Prosecutor 's Office and topped by feminist activists she said that this trans lobby pretends she says they are her statements campaigning for paedophilia she intends to medicate Spanish students with puberty blockers hormones and other medications And he says that the ultimate purpose of these gender laws is to make women invisible He believes that gender laws are the greatest attack on women in the last 50 years and they allow a gentleman swimmer who is not even among the three hundred best swimmers to declare himself a woman to beat all the cuts and to cut all the podiums because you will be able to hide everything you want with your genres but you cannot hide sexual dimorphism that is scientific evidence Here Mr Echenique was speaking this morning about the scientific consensus with climate change With what there is a scientific consensus is with chromosomes and with the result of that chromosomal division which is sexual dimorphism And you 're gonna load up the women 's sport you 're gonna load up the women 's sport with these gender theories that go all over each other Another block as Mr Errejón another radiating nucleus would say of ideology is its climate fanaticism which includes everywhere in the agenda and in the curriculum of Secondary And understand me well we would find it wonderful that the phenomenon of climate change will be dealt with from scientific coordinates that it be explained for example in Chemistry what are the greenhouse gases and that not only carbon dioxide should be said because water vapor is the most important factor And I do n't think you guys should put an ecotase on those who cook I am convinced that it would be great to explain in mathematics how these statistical calculations are made these statistical models of climate change how temperatures are obtained the different climatic phases of the planet All this would be great but you do n't do that You want to form activists on the Greta you want to have an army of individuals who are only dedicated to repeating their mantras their ideological mantras which are ruining our primary sector and our energy sector In addition you have done something rather curious and I 'm already going to the Bachelor 's curricula we 'll talk about this already we 'll have more time to talk about it you 'll allow me with the History of Philosophy agenda I have been a professor of History of Philosophy for thirty years and it turns out that you have gone in the haystack to look for a needle that does not exist and have found it so as to give a feminist bias to the History of Philosophy They put us at Plato 's and Aristotle 's aspasia of Miletus Surely everyone knows Miletus Aspasia philosophical Hispanism is well known They place at the height of Plato and Aristotle a lady who was dedicated to rhetoric and who apparently according to some sources also 2 They place it at the height of Plato and Aristotle But we go to the Middle Ages and there they put poor Saint Hildegard a Benedictine nun who dedicated herself to natural history not philosophy Natural history is the way in which natural sciences were called at that time that is a bit of botany a bit of geology What does this lady who at best could say that she is theologist in a curriculum of History of Philosophy paint Why By their chromosomes Those that apparently do n't exist according to gender theory You 'll tell me cause let 's see what he looks like there It will not be because of your feminism because come on you tell me that a Benedictine nun is a defender of feminism for up to that point we have arrived In the Illustration you also put two perfect strangers Mrs. Olimpia de Gouges or Mary Wollstonecraft very famous because you went to France to see how they guillotined poor Marie Antonieta That 's all We do n't know anything It is true that the French made a text called Vondication of the rights of men and Vondication of the rights of women where by the way she defends virginity that is a feminist for this lady too It 's amazing But absurdity comes in the Modern and Contemporary Philosophy where you place next to Carlos Marx no less than Hannah Arendt a fierce anticommunist They put her next to Carlos Marx Man you could have put Rosa Luxemburg even if it were Well no sir Hannah Arendt a defender of pluralism and democracy and they put her next to Carlos Marx And to finish the matter in the Contemporary Philosophy you forget the father of phenomenology of Edmund Husserl you forget Bertrand Russell and all his contribution to the logic and theory of science you forget Gustavo Well the father of philosophical materialism you forget Unamuno and you put us to the testist Maria Zambrano who by the way was also dedicated to the phenomenology of religious fact Another feminist And they also put Simone de Beauvoir there but they do n't put us in their partner Jean Paul Sartre It 's amazing What is the criterion for deciding the authors of the History of Philosophy What 's in your crotch Is that the criterion Come on it 's just amazing From a philosophical point of view it is inadmissible for you to make this trap to sneak up in the morning here to non-partisan characters 2 Words withdrawn by the Presidency in accordance with Rule 104.3 of the Rules of Procedure of the House See page 110 of the history of philosophy and whose contribution to the history of philosophy is as irrelevant as that of Minister Iceta to the classical ballet And finally mathematics You have eliminated the rule of three in Primary you have eliminated the Roman numerals but it is that in the ESO and in the Baccalaureate you have eliminated the theorem of the breast and the theorem of the cosine It must be that the breast has no gender perspective They 've eliminated Cramer 's theorem Bolzano 's theorem they 've delayed the study of equation systems This is said by a professor a doctor in Mathematics Carlos Madrid in an interview with the national newspaper You 've removed the algorithms In other words it seems that the gender perspective consists in lowering the content to make mathematics perhaps more attractive I remembered Euclid 's anecdote Euclid wrote his geometry elements because Pharaoh Ptolemy asked him to do so I wanted to learn the man When Euclid gave him those elements of geometry Pharaoh did not understand anything and asked him to do something more digestible something let 's say with Pharaoh 's perspective to understand it but Euclid said to him Majesty there are no real ways to learn geometry I mean there are no smooth roads plains no hindrances on which Pharaoh walked with his chariot There are no real ways to learn geometry nor to learn physics nor to learn mathematics nor philosophy nor history The only real path is the effort the study the discipline that with what you want to end with your general approval with your elimination of numerical notes etc. favoring those who can afford a private education and harming the Spanish people who are forced to eat that ideological papilla that you provide them That 's what public education leads to but do n't worry about it because this will change There is already a political party that promises that if it comes to power and it will be sooner than later it will put all Spanish students on an equal footing studying the same according to any model they study and with no prospect of being Basque Catalan Andalusian or Murcian All the same all the same all according to their merit and ability Madam Minister what you have just done is an attack on public education no matter how much you say you defend it Thank you very much
Madam Minister Madam President ladies and gentlemen we are again here to talk about rules and prohibitions that have failed to contain the pandemic such as Royal Decree Law 30/2021 of 23 December which among other things regulates the use of masks We say it loudly there is no scientific study I repeat there is no study that has demonstrated the usefulness of outdoor masks Of course they are useful in indoor spaces and an FFP2 mask is better than a surgical one and is in turn better than a fabric one but none of them are worth anything if it is misused or used longer than due it is more they can become a walking focal point of contagion That 's the real problem But it is a problem that you have preferred to hide because it would mean treating the Spanish as adults which this government never wants to do They prefer to subject the Spaniards to absurd regulations and then rejoice at how they obey them which gives them a sense of domination over the population Better to impose than to report on reality But as a doctor I assure you that the Spaniards have good health criteria have common sense and are getting tired of their absurd and unjustified impositions The Spanish Government and the Taifa governments never inform the Spanish if they did they would have to recognize VOX 's proposal for the masks to be financed That 's the real problem We have a clear example in schools where this tyranny is exercised more rigorously The chances of hospitalization and ICU in children are extremely low and the minimal lethality so it makes no sense to use masks in recreation and in a context of high vaccination of the parents neither in the interior Adequate ventilation diagnostic tests and masks suitable for teachers That 's the way to go in schools When a parent knows that a reused mask is an infection vehicle we will be fighting the epidemic When the state funds the masks we 'll be fighting the pandemic When filter ventilation mechanisms are put in place in public transport we will be fighting the pandemic When a family does n't spend 10 of their income buying masks and antigen testing we 'll be fighting the epidemic This government does not fight the epidemic all you do is dictate a useless measure to cover up your incompetence Not to finance masks or to cancel the VAT on FFP2 masks is a credible proof that the government puts the collection before the citizen 's health You only think of collecting to then waste that money that you steal from the Spaniards in wages for the useless plugs that the NGOs and the ministries parasitize Stop bittering the lives of citizens make recommendations report well and have citizens decide freely We 're sick of such baseless imposition That 's it With regard to article 2 with regard to the recruitment of retired health personnel we believe that the work should be adapted to its risk profile at reduced hours not at night and also with an adequate tax contribution and remuneration to compensate them for their sacrifice In relation to article 3 do you believe that hiring extra-Community doctors will solve the saturation of primary and specialized care We 're telling you it 's not going to be like this It would be smarter to perform concerts with private health and only go to non-Community specialists if necessary and always taking into account the opinion of professional colleges Finally the Government has introduced into this royal decree law a matter that has nothing to do with the essence of the decree it is an ugly practice that you abuse where you hang a matter as transcendental as that of pensions which deserves a separate treatment It is good enough to use pensioners and our elders as currency Stop blackmailing this Congress to cover up its inability to give a dignified solution to the weakest people It is always the same ladies and gentlemen they throw the bone of the debate at those Tertullians on the left who come out like dogs of prey to bite and attack the opposition parties telling half truths or lying without any kind of modesty to widows elders or parents of disabled people By the way this group opposes the comparative aggravation between pensioners who have contributed and those who have not when they have very similar pay We do n't care Ortega Lara 's game does n't pay for blackmail Madam President ladies and gentlemen we will oppose the validation of this royal decree- law not only because of the obligation to wear masks or because of its harmful management of human resources in public health but also because we consider it a genuine aberration and a cowardice on your part Mr Sánchez to put in the same package the masks and the management of human resources health along with a subject as serious as pensions We cannot allow pensioners to continue to be used as a currency of exchange because it is cruel and inhuman and clearly portrays the ill intentions of this Government totalitarianism and imposition In VOX we will always defend the Spaniards especially the weakest and that is why we will not allow this blackmail Thank you very much
Good afternoon President Ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to offer our condolences to the family of Sara Gómez who died after a liposculpture I think that talking about cosmetic surgery in a general way leads us to mix concepts and can harm the professional practice of many doctors in Spain On the one hand this sector employs a large number of healthcare professionals so we would have to be extremely careful when talking about them in order not to generalise criminalise or induce suspicions that may harm them On the other hand we must take into account the safety of people undergoing aesthetic treatments This initiative seems well intentioned because it aims to improve the protection of users as well as to combat intrusiveness However in order to assess its scope it would be necessary to know the text of the concrete amendments that are proposed to be incorporated into the text of Royal Decree 1277 2003 or other rules that indicate us in the initiative Thus point 3 of the proposal states that it is intended to amend the Royal Decree establishing the general basis for the authorization of health centres services and facilities This regulatory rule was not enacted to regulate the exercise of the qualified professions since it is a subject reserved in accordance with the rule of law and is intended only to lay down the basic requirements for the authorisation of health centres and establishments Point 4 of the proposal states that it is presented to combat the eradication of any intrusiveness and pseudoscience affecting the various specialties of medical professions The purpose is certainly laudable However it should be noted that there are no plural medical professions since as can be seen from the Law on the Ordination of Sanitary Professions in its article 5 and it has already been written in its day by the Supreme Court the medical profession is one and the medical specialties are a character with which it is exercised The holding of the title of specialist will be necessary for the express use of the designation of specialist for the exercise of the profession with such character and for the occupation of jobs with such name in public and private centres and establishments To combat professional intrusiveness in medicine and in today 's specialty the said law should be amended that is a rule with legal rank We also have to assume that the different medical procedures are statistically subject to various complications such as bleeding infections destabilization of pre-existing pathologies known or not in the patient side effects of the medicines used and other vicissitudes Therefore information to the patient and user is essential for him to assume that he is exposing his health and sometimes his life and to decide freely whether or not to undergo these treatments with full knowledge We must also differentiate the activities undertaken by aesthetic centers in which apparatus is used that have a use in addition to aesthetic sanitary such as laser or pulsed light apparatus They should only be used for uses that the personnel handling them have authorized and never in medical treatments The same applies to parenteral administration of medicines such as hyaluronic acid or botulinum toxin which require the informed consent of the patient as a medical procedure that is and should be administered by an optional With the above clarifications we have made an amendment to improve the information to be provided on healthcare professionals and medical procedures for which they are legally authorized and trained to carry out and thus avoid the intrusiveness of other professionals who are not Thank you very much
Mr President ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to point out that the aim of this Commission was to investigate vaccination in Spain not in Europe or in the rest of the world In addition it had stated objectives from the outset which consisted of analysing among other issues whether high ranking vaccination groups had been jumped of which it is not astonishment here as well as the rest of the objectives A year ago VOX told them that it was not the time to start an investigation when the Spaniards were still in the middle of the pandemic and we had to deal with more practical things for the citizen such as mitigating the queues of hunger raising small businesses that the illegal closure imposed by the government had ruined and caring for and empowering our health professionals At the time it was not that VOX thought that investigating the entire management of the vaccine was not necessary on the contrary but we thought that an investigation by this government was a waste of time because we were not going to know anything and it would only serve for the politicians who govern us to throw flowers at each other as it has been I will explain to the Members who have not been in the Commission and to the Spaniards who listen to me that we have not participated in the Commission because they imposed on us the list of assistants in an undemocratic way without respecting our share of participation and refusing to quote any of the representatives proposed by VOX We had no choice but to stop wavering to the Socialcommunist Left and the nationalists and we stopped being part of this drama that was the Commission After the time of appearance twenty five participants in total and all of similar opinions since for this reason they had been chosen the time came for conclusions and pantomimes of recommendations The conclusions set out in the opinion have given us reason The speech seems to be made by the minister 's cabinet Reading it gives the impression of being in front of the ministry 's vaccination strategy The basic text on which he has worked is that of the PSOE and on this text the rest of the groups made their amendments United We can make an attack on private property price intervention and blaming the pharmaceutical industry The PNV proposed to delete all references to co-governance and to try to delete everything that was Spanish in character They prefer the context of the European Union of Health while the Spaniards spend their lives being cared for by other communities or getting an appointment of specialties Compromís brought an allegory to the NGO Doctors of the World in order to attack the pharmaceutical industry and promote the vaccination system in the countries where they have representation forgetting the rest of the world The Republican Parliamentary Group in a love for work that covers half a leaf spoke of something important such as the side effects of vaccines but lomezclaved with other points and questioned that the first vaccination groups had to be chronically ill From the whole period of amendments came the final text of the Commission 's opinion which varied little from the original except in some small reference here and there to what was amended to satisfy the partners of government However there are different points to highlight from what we are talking about and I insist that in no way meets the objectives of the convention in its constitution First they claim that the actual cost of vaccines is unknown How do you understand this Do n't you know how much they 've paid or how much they owe for the vaccines they 've bought What contracts have you signed Have you signed a blank cheque to the European Union without asking for explanations Why this obscurantism Is this going to be the case for all centralised purchases with the European Union Ladies and gentlemen when paid with public money there can be no confidentiality clauses explanations must be given We demand transparency Another issue to be noted is that at this point any citizen knows that Spain is participating in solidarity vaccination and in the transfer of knowledge However the opinion does not provide any information about how much money you are giving to other countries for this purpose when in Spain you are not taking care of the entrepreneurs you have ruined with the closure of your businesses We would like to know how much money you are giving to other countries and how much you are devoting to the recovery of the Spaniards because after all it is our money that you waste In addition in the case of knowledge transfer it is insulting that the Spanish benefit from the diagnostic test given to C TAPno Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission you have not met any of the objectives No irregularities delays or vaccination failures have been found What a coincidence Nothing is said that the delay in buying vaccines ruined our country 's health and tourism Nothing is said about the lack of concreteness about the responsibilities that can be generated by the adverse effect of vaccines The Government and the European Union are obliged to declare the degree of responsibility of governments and the industry for the adverse effects Nothing is said about the reason why doctors are not allowed to prescribe vaccines Nothing is said about why the vaccine data sheet was skipped to start a heterologous vaccination It should also be noted that the Spanish Government has not given a cent for the development of the vaccines received by the Spanish neither a euro to Pfizer nor a euro to Moderna nor to AstraZeneca but what the parties of the left and separatists are considering is to give money to the cannabis manufacturers flagged by Podemos and his travelling companion in this case the PNV Finally they congratulate themselves on the vaccination I will tell you in this regard that making the possibility of vaccination available to the citizens is only their obligation and it is thanks to the citizenship of the Spaniards that the scope of vaccination in Spain because they have come to be vaccinated and protected in a massive way demonstrating common sense trust in the science and maturity that we have as a society Thank you very much
"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon The ceramic industry is a leading sector that has suffered enormously in these years and it is necessary to support its recovery but it is enough of unfulfilled promises Before entering the electoral campaign it would be useful to explain why the companies in the ceramic sector and so many Spanish companies have been left out of funds designed precisely for that purpose for recovery A month ago the ASCER employer met with President Sánchez and sent him the urgency to act on the part of the government and they have received no reply to date only promises Nor do the various ministries to which he has come respond I 'm addressing the government and telling them that before they promise they 'll do it Basically what is happening is the loss of competitiveness in the prices of the product in the ceramic sector compared to our main competitor in the European Union which is not other than Italian which helps the sector with a 40 bonus on the price of gas leaving us in total defencelessness and inferior in terms of competition It must be borne in mind that the lost position on the market is very difficult to recover and that there is competition in the European Union beyond Italy They are countries that in the ceramic sector do not have such a high dependence on gas as is the case with Poland whose companies rely mostly on coal or neighbouring countries such as Turkey which has its own gas and is not suffering from this price rise In this respect as a more obvious example we have the case of the United States of America which at the time for the most part imported Spanish ceramics but which due to the large increase in both material and freight costs and maritime transport has been strengthened its own ceramic industry which exploits its own gas and produces its own land Even there have already been cases of renowned Italian and Portuguese factories that have relocated their production to Tennessee where their government receives with open arms and all kinds of aid and facilities for their new production plants there By the way ladies and gentlemen I must announce to you that representatives of the Tennessee government were last week in Castellón visiting ceramic industries specifically in Villarreal as well to offer you the means for this relocation We are talking about relocation to the United States not a third world country What this motion does not say is that in Spain a Recovery Transformation and Resilience Plan has been approved which between aid and loans can reach up to EUR 140 billion which are barely reaching companies and which is excluding SMEs We had and have the opportunity to support this sector we have the instruments and it was a great opportunity but you and the majority that supports the government by paralysing the processing of a rule that regulates these funds are being necessary collaborators for this exclusion The ceramic sector of the province of Castellón represents the fourth largest producer of ceramic tiles in the world and the first in Europe being also the second largest exporter on the planet only surpassed by China Thus this sector places the province of Castellón in the world and therefore Spain creating wealth and many jobs as many as 17,180 direct jobs and about 50,000 indirect jobs In Castellón the rise in the price of gas and the war in Ukraine has put more than 11,000 workers into ERTE not 9000 64 of the total workforce mainly in those low cost companies that did not have the limited profit margin that they had entering into losses and presenting ERTE and worse in some cases ERE which means the destruction of employment If the government acted like Italian many ERTE could be recovered which would be very beneficial for workers and businesses From June 2021 to date the impact of the gas per square metre produced has quadrupled In the ceramic sector it already rains on wet because to increase the price of gas it is added that the clays that came from Ukraine to manufacture the products have been gone for quite some time having to resort to looking for others not so good and having to change the formulas of the mixtures to manufacture the products Ladies and gentlemen Castellón 's ceramics is Spain 's brand and it must be borne in mind that in a country as deindustrialised as Spain Castellón is one of the few provinces that has as its largest family income generator an industry such as ceramics which exports more than two thirds of its production worldwide Ladies and gentlemen one question are we prepared to risk the livelihood and the future of an entire province It 's over President"
"Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen the current Spanish foreign policy is in a deep crisis because of its improvisation and lack of direction In his appearance last week the minister told us of successes during his term but he was left with pride and let go of humility to recognize the errors of silence that have been made during this time A paradigmatic example of this improvised policy at the service of Sánchez is found in the letter sent to Mohamed VI published by the Royal Moroccan House on 14 March which modified Spain 's historical position on the Sahara avoiding as you know any prior consultation with the king and his own government and what is more serious avoiding any parliamentary debate which is not acceptable In addition it has given rise to all kinds of speculation related to the Pegasus affair and the theft of information from Sánchez 's phone because no one in this House no one finds any other reason for this change unless it is a personal decision of the president which is equally unacceptable Foreign policy is a policy of state and therefore of consensus with the rest of the political forces especially with the main opposition parties so Sánchez cannot and should not act as head of state because he simply is not If humans are making mistakes fools are persevering in error and this is what the president did on April 7 three weeks later when he travelled to Morocco and signed a joint statement in which moreover there is not a single word about the Spanishness of Ceuta and Melilla and of the Spanish sovereignty islands and pawns to the north of Africa This is where the weakness of this social communist government is clearly perceived once again On the contrary the Moroccan Government persists in its aggressive assertive policy with its claims of sovereignty over these territories Morocco qualifies Ceuta and Melilla as usurped cities which it considers together with the islands and peñones the last colonies in Africa The Kingdom of Morocco has its permanent interests clear while our Government is banditling in its relations with that kingdom and agreeing that it is this country that marks the road map according to its interests and in whatever way it may be Ladies and gentlemen the Maghreb has tried to dress one saint by undressing another a lack of political touch that has led us to have Algeria suspend the Treaty of Friendship and review its trade relations with Spain especially those related to the supply of gas something which is not a reality at this time of energy crisis For lack of time today I will not talk about Europe in which we are no longer among the best nor about Ibero America where we have lost influence The motion that the PP brings us today is like a letter to the Magi with a fifteen point petitum that we will vote one by one ten of them being more defense than outside although some of them deserve a comment Point 2 calls for NATO 's new strategic concept to provide for the protection of the entire national territory with particular attention to non- peninsular territories Ladies and gentlemen of the PP welcome to the postulates of VOX although we would have liked to request the amendment of Article 6 of the Treaty to explicitly include the cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the islands and pawns of Spanish sovereignty to the North of Africa something proposed by our group repeatedly and we therefore tabled an amendment to this point as well as three other amendments to points 6 and 7 concerning the maintenance of materials and defence budgets Point 14 refers to the threats to freedom emanating from totalitarian communist cut movements in Hispano America to which we are also submitting another amendment and we hope that all of them will be taken into account by the People 's Group Point 13 calls for the resumption of the political economic and commercial relationship with Algeria thereby restoring the position of active neutrality with regard to the future of Sahara prior to the famous letter of 14 March This point seems of vital importance to us since not only does Morocco apply the strategy of immigration blackmail to us but Algeria given the results of our new relationship with Morocco has done the same by allowing the departure of more than one hundred irregular and illegal immigrants who arrived to the Balearic Islands on board six pateras last June 8th it seems that as a warning and retaliation for the declarations made by Sánchez in this Congress on the same day on June 8th when he reaffirmed himself in his bandage with regard to the Sahara Ladies and gentlemen I conclude with a reflection that has to make us think seriously More than 2,000 immigrants attempted the assault on the Melilla fence last Friday with a terrible record of dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded among them our civilian guards Scary images of an invasion that according to Sánchez has been well resolved by Morocco What a lack of empathy for the autocrat These misfortunes and the attack on our security and sovereignty are the consequences of the migration policies of this government"
I 'm done in no humanitarian or human rights protection and which also generate a so called effect and feed the mafias of human trafficking something you are already aware of In the end they 'll agree with VOX
Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen Members of the Assembly of the Community of Madrid welcome A preview as you like to say to a famous Member of Parliament here Mr Baldoví do not try any harder we already know that you dance very well in fact you dance other well but we will not hire you for the 22nd that we already have high level figures not like you We are discussing today the consideration of a proposal for a law that deals with the amendment of three state laws the General of Grants the Law on Public Sector Contracts and the Organic Law Regulating the Right of Association and it does so for the purpose of combating anti-Semitism although it is clarified in the initiative that in this case it is specifically sought to protect those who profess the Jewish religion and not other ethnic groups or beliefs that could also be included in the concept of Semitism which is somewhat broader In the preamble in particular the aim is to bring about a change in legislation so that public aid contracts or subsidies may not be available to entities which carry out discriminatory practices on grounds of birth race sex religion belief and in particular stress on anti-Semitic grounds in order to determine clearly the loss of opportunities when such a situation occurs It is clear that our parliamentary group as the autonomous deputy Pablo Gutiérrez de Cabiedes has already put forward here will support the consideration of this initiative because it is of justice The serious attacks that have been suffered in Spain by those who profess the Jewish religion as well as the Christians by phylotterrorist groups linked to leftism are chased by supporters who have representation in public institutions without going any further in this very House through extreme leftism of socialists and ultra leftism of communists That is why measures must be taken to curb them We have heard you say here many excuses for not deciding clearly to support this initiative but ladies and gentlemen works are love and not good reasons It is works that you leave in a number of municipalities of Spain through the famous network of municipalities ELAI free spaces of Israeli apartheid all of which are governed by parties of front populist court and under whose umbrellas there have been and there are actions as disgusting as conjures to not engage with any companies products entities or organizations of Israeli origin or with Jewish links because of the simple fact of being so or to apply to everything that smells of Jewish the so called politics or culture of cancellation that is canceling contracts with theatre companies lecturers filmmakers actors or Israeli companies that are in progress being the most serious example that happened in Cadiz in September 2018 when the communist mayor of that city known as the Kichi took precedence of his office as mayor to promote this racist act and the ruthless attack that using the power of the City of Molins de Rei in Barcelona his mayor perpetuated in November 2018 against a group of women youths in opposition to the Spanish party that some officials in this dispute prevent these parties The party had to play elsewhere and behind closed doors as if the girls were stinking Faced with this it should also be remembered that my parliamentary group defended last week in the Constitutional Commission a PNL calling for greater protection for the right of religious freedom of Spain a PNL that defended our colleague and deputy José María Sánchez and that was rejected in this House by the leftist groups The result serves as a demonstration and confirmation of the continued belligerence of leftism in the twenty first century towards a fundamental freedom for the support of any democratic system such as religious freedom Works are love and not good reasons I told them More works According to the report prepared by the Observatory for Religious Freedom and Consciousness during 2020 attacks on the right to religious freedom in Spain increased by 37 over the previous year especially against the Catholic religion According to the observatory the breakdown by type of attacks would be as follows two cases of direct physical aggression against Catholic believers for being so thirty attacks on Catholic places of worship twelve harassments against Catholic believers for being so fifty seven scorns against Catholic beliefs and believers 121 cases of belligerent secularism with marginalization from the religion of the public sphere Ladies and gentlemen listen carefully two out of three acts of violence against hatred Fidei in Spain suffered by a Catholic in 2020 Not only are the Jews attacked in Spain in Europe and in the world but also Christians and we Christians are the ones who suffer the most martyrdom all over the world Therefore ladies and gentlemen when this initiative is taken into consideration we will work to ensure that the right to religious freedom is guaranteed also for Christians and we will improve this initiative with amendments In short ladies and gentlemen rather than collectivizing society as leftism does by fabricating false offenses to which to water with public money it is necessary to protect those who are real victims of attacks that they pay with their lives On this path you will always find VOX and very soon you will see how it is also decided in Spain Thank you very much
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Today we are discussing a bill to reform the Congressional Rules of Procedure which basically aims to control the Government 's compliance with what is agreed on in the GNP and other motions that are passed It turns out that for the PNV this great party of state which is always willing to cut it here it is not urgent that the regulation be amended so that the political plurality that we represent here is real and effective so that for example the third parliamentary group in this House is treated with justice There is nothing going on in front of the cacicada that VOX has been deprived of being present at the tables of all the commissions all of them There has been no democratic decency to respect in this House the order of majority that the Spanish people have established with their votes There is nothing at all about the fact that VOX has been allocated seats by way of irregular and arbitrary distribution through the Chamber while other groups such as the proposer with a small number of Members enjoy privileged locations It does not seem to be a problem either if Members of the third parliamentary group are arbitrarily deprived of their participation in international activities to which this House sends representatives placing in their place Members of groups with much less representation as is the case with whom The PNV Oh my God For the PNV the important thing is that in Congress we lose more time with the PNL and other motions We all know in this House that GNP and motions are nothing but declarations of principle that they are indeed important for deepening the quality of our democracy but that they are not binding and we are not just saying this nor a large part of the liberal sector as the Constitutional Court 's judgment 180/1991 also says And they cannot be binding because the separation of powers proper to a democratic State determines that the essential function of the Legislative Power is to draft laws In short Article 203 bis proposed by the Basque Nationalist Party goes beyond the constitutional function assigned to this House But this is not an obstacle of course for VOX to have brought good non-legislative initiatives to this Parliament such as the one calling on the Government to suspend the granting of visas to nationals of countries who refuse to readmit those who are expelled for illegally entering Spain And it is that we do not have to endure those who violently assault our borders of Ceuta and Melilla recognized by Minister Marlaska and seriously and savagely harm our police officers Or the one calling on the Ministry of Equality to guarantee equality among all Spaniards because men and with us many women are already tired of being pointed out as stinking Or like the one calling for measures to prevent ETA from deciding Spain 's prison policy Because ETA has not only not disappeared it has an influence on politics because you peneuvists and also socialists are very comfortable with it after having bleached it What a shame Of course these initiatives were also rejected with the votes of the PNV But look even assuming they could have been approved by a majority what would they have served For really little by little because you cannot be required to answer to those who do not comply with what is not binding upon them so simple however much you gentlemen of the PNV propose And you yourself Mr. Legarda have recognized him in the rostrum We really are not here to waste time we are here to legislate and to do it right which is our obligation It would therefore have been interesting for his proposal to deal for example with improving the system of drafting laws Because let us see is it acceptable as a parliamentary practice for one or more groups to make amendments outside of a legislative presentation by denying participation to the rest of the groups Or is it acceptable as a parliamentary practice that in some legislative papers they are presented by majority groups in a surprising way and without time for their study massive modifications of the normative texts in progress forcing their vote in addition We do n't think so The question is gentlemen of the PNV whether you as a group linked to the majority that supports the Government recognize yourselves as collaborators in such practices And since we are talking about regulatory changes I ask you have you agreed to encourage the amendment of the Basque Parliament 's Rules of Procedure to ensure ideological plurality and political participation I do n't think so I say this because of the totalitarian deprivation of democratic rights which under the guise of loopholes or voids in your rules of procedure of the regional Parliament you together with your socialist communist and Batasun allies are imposing on our parliamentarian Amaia Martínez whom we admire for her courage and send from here a strong embrace Ladies and gentlemen of the PNV we Members of VOX are not like you We are not afraid to discuss their parliamentary initiatives however absurd some of them may seem to us you see You on the other hand do not dare to do the same with VOX in the Basque Regional Parliament It seems that the brave Gudaris even playing with a great numerical advantage are shaking their legs In short it seems that this time there will be no unanimity We will vote not on your proposal for a law not because we intend to do this illegitimate government the favor you know that it is not but because we only managed to waste all our time even more and we are not for this We cost the Spanish people a lot of money and for that reason they deserve a little more respect from us Nothing more and thank you very much
Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen It is really difficult to talk about budgets when we have an unscrupulous government that betraying its nation changes accounts for penalties and deceives us with tales to release prisoners and the tales start every autumn with the new general budgets of the state Both the AIReF and the Banco de España the European Commission and the IEE among other bodies have questioned the data on which the budgets are based because they are not credible Title III staff costs is a subject on which the Government has not stopped fooling all Spaniards since it drew up the first budgets of this legislature in 2020 We have already said this last year and also the previous year and the previous year it is indecent to place on the Spaniards the burden of putting up with an elephantic government that to top it off spends public money on insulting us all by calling us wasteful Did you waste Crazy for turning on the light or putting on the heating Did you waste Crazy for trying to live with the dignity that we have earned by right and that this government should protect because that 's what we pay you for How dare you thus lose respect for the Spanish people How dare you What do we call a government that has not wanted to reduce a single ministry a single high office or a single euro of political spending to share even a little the pressures in which its people live How What do we call a government that has n't stopped hiring advisors even at the worst time in the pandemic when the worst people were going through it How From January to September of this year this government has broken the national record of spending on advisors 51.5 million according to data from the General State Intervention This represents an increase of almost 6 over the previous year Is this your way of showing empathy Yes the Spaniards have seen what that is called progressiveism It 's a school of peseprismo and mammourria What if they start by shutting down the Ministry of Equality In the current year its staffing has been increased by 121 121 But in view of 2023 they are planning to put 65 more officials in that pool of incompetence and hatred And for what To keep calling us criminals all men To lower the penalties to rapists or pederasts or to protect women kidnap children Because that is what this ministry is dedicated to under the orders of the Government because they are not avoiding the deaths of women at the hands of men or men at the hands of women nor by the way those of children at the hands of their parents men and women yes also women even if it bothers them to hear it that is the truth Is that the authority of this ministry that we have heard before Mr. Honrubia No the government will not close it but we will as soon as we can because in a VOX government there will be no room for hatred of the Spanish be they men or women Another well known unskilled public manger is the Ministry of Universities How many Spaniards would know the minister 's name Not even a survey of Tezanos would fix it ladies and gentlemen In these circumstances they promise to increase the staffing by 31 more by 2023 when by 2022 it had already increased by 65 over the previous year This is see gon zo so And we come to the ministry of the Presidency the courtship of Mr. Bolaños who attends this gentleman named Pedro Sánchez A staff of 1721 is planned for the coming year of which 37 will be senior officials and 553 advisers And in VOX we ask ourselves How much does Pedro Sánchez need to live among flattery ladies and gentlemen Because a politician who needs a contribution of 553 advisors is either deeply incompetent or is implementing a giant manger which will be very resilient and very circular but nothing sustainable This is a policy of leverage ladies and gentlemen of leverage And in the face of this waste the Directorate General of the Police will see the police force reduced in 2023 by 4138 implying a loss of more than 5 of its staff Ladies and gentlemen without security there is no freedom even the socialists are already beginning to recognize that octopus is a problem that worries the Spaniards and they are not mere bubbles of what you call far right Looks like they want to get out of the matrix they live in Well socialist ladies and gentlemen welcome to reality But it is that the Ministry of Justice also rigs the other pillar that supports the security building the Administration of Justice allowing insults to the judiciary breaching the commitments made with judges and prosecutors lawyers and other officials No bargaining tables for wages no pay adjustments no reduction of population groups no updating of the amount of guards outstanding for years Nothing for 2023 We need more cops more judges and less plugs ladies and gentlemen These budgets of ruin have no possible amendment because with this government the distance must be infinite Fortunately every day there is less for our country to regain democratic normality freedom order and security Members of the Government you will have to listen to us We will demand from here and also from the streets of Spain that they stop hurting our people We will teach them that democracy is respected and defended Thank you very much
Good morning ladies and gentlemen This draft organic law whose adoption we are discussing today is intended to transpose a European directive of 2019 1153 the aim of which is within a context of judicial and police cooperation to allow certain authorities and officials access to and exchange of information of a financial nature in order to make possible the prevention detection investigation and prosecution on European soil of a number of serious crimes being one of the most important to combat those linked to terrorism and its financing and this is expressly mentioned Terrorism on European soil is today particularly linked to Islam although consensus is progressing and of course this government and you Minister too deliberately conceal it from us because you think it is a small detail And they hide it from us so that it is not evident what millions of Europeans had the opportunity to witness in May in Saint Denis Paris that the multicultural experiment that you have introduced in some neighborhoods of our cities has turned them into outlaws of religious fanaticism hatred and crime Directed against whom Minister Against ourselves against our women against whom we have welcomed them with stupid generosity while you were singing your promises of an inclusive socialist paradise It is clear that socialism in any version of it is the opium of the people And the reality progressive ladies and gentlemen is that with their foolish policies these neighborhoods now house caves of terrorists and other criminals from where money is collected and soldiers are recruited to attack us in our own land Hence the desirability of having tools such as the one introduced by this European directive to allow the cooperation of authorities and officials to trace sources of financing for serious crimes such as terrorism But of course if our authorities and officials discover with the financial title file or with any other instrument that uses a money gathering focus in one of those multicultural neighborhoods also known as no go zone how are they going to get to the criminals You Minister surely know what kind reception our police receive when they dare to enter some of those areas Look I 'll show you News from El Faro de Ceuta April of this year The National Police intervenes a assault rifle in the Prince 's district in Ceuta This is how they receive the National Police in the Prince 's neighborhood this morning Men and adults receive the local police stoned in Prince Alfonso's neighborhood The Prince the neighborhood where basic community services are to be provided should be escorted by police And this is happening in Ceuta Spain Minister And this is the model of coexistence to be exported all over the world as some Member said here two days ago What is here is a lot of ignorance about the reality of the Islamic world If you want to know I 'm going to give you three names to find out you can Google them Asia Bibi Deborah Yakubu Maria Jusuf from the town of Borda On the other hand the European directive does not require you to assign powers of international communication to the autonomous police That has been invented by you ladies and gentlemen of the Government because you are still obsessed with the mantra of co-governance With the current model the only possible governance is that everyone exercises his or her powers by assuming his or her own responsibilities and always always with the Government of Spain as the ultimate responsibility for everything Therefore international relations between authorities and officials should be dealt with by the Government of Spain with its institutions and under its control Because as far as I know Minister as far as I know the Spanish Government today has no control over autonomous police such as Basque or Catalan police And how can the Spanish Government ensure that the commanders of these police appointed by governments that do not assume their membership of our nation will behave loyally when their own governments do not do so Can you ensure that the local police share with the National Police and the Civil Guard all information about risks and crimes It is clear that we have no longer seen this for example on the occasion of the coup d'état of October 17 in Catalonia The autonomous police forces are only empowered by constitutional mandate to participate in the maintenance of public security because public security is the exclusive competence of the State hence the need for our amendments because the threats affect us all Spanish and do not understand autonomous borders Since it could not be otherwise we also do not think that they should take advantage of this bill to introduce a new tax that of waste through amendments by the Socialist Group and also to give new powers and money to self government It is seen ladies and gentlemen that they do not miss any opportunity to put our hand more in our pockets You socialist ladies and gentlemen and your conglomerate of communists coups and flounders are already out you are in free fall as VOX grows election after election If you still have a minimum of shame save yourself all the more suffering Spaniards and let go of those who can bring order and above all decency Nothing more and thank you very much
Good morning ladies and gentlemen minister The truth is that when I met this bill that talks about fighting corruption I was amazed I could not believe that precisely the PSOE the party most closely linked to corruption plots in Europe could promote such an initiative I understand that the Socialists had finally decided to take responsibility for the terrible plot of corruption in Andalusia or for the recent Qatargate or Morocco Gate a corrupt plot that particularly affects your European parliamentary group but with you there is no hope Now if as they say this rule will serve to protect whistleblowers from corruption perhaps ladies and gentlemen of the PSOE you still have a chance to do something for your country Let 's see Can any of you help us recover almost 700 million that Andalusian socialism has stolen from all Spaniards Can any of you tell us if there is any high socialist office that has been favoring Morocco 's interests in exchange for money Is there a brave man sitting in those seats that 's cheering up Does n't look like it does it Anyway I must admit that as we said in the Commission it has been hard for us to discover that under the pretty wrap candy was poisoned because under those headlines who talk about protecting whistleblowers from corruption and fighting it this project really hides a content that is highly toxic to democracy and coexistence This bill says it transposes a European directive but the truth is that it ends up perverting it and it does so because it extends its object to any criminal offence and to any serious administrative offence and is not limited only to the list contained in the directive Observe observe insist how its name begins Draft law regulating the protection of persons reporting administrative offences Let them report administrative violations see This was the important thing was n't it ladies and gentlemen Wow This bill simply makes it possible to open up general causes against defects And of course to protect whistleblowers even anonymous ones within the framework of the liberticidal laws created by this government such as sectarians called for democratic memory equality abortion or the next few for animal or trans protection among others we are dangerously approaching Spain from its Popular Front or Marxist Cuba with the famous political whistleblowers right Mr Santiago You know them well Can you imagine what can happen for example to a teacher who is heard by the political commissioner explaining to his students that human beings are biologically men or women Can you imagine what can happen for example to a foundation that is observed by an infiltrator giving a talk about PSOE 's criminal history during the 1930s Of course they imagine it of course that 's why they have expanded the object in this twisted way It is clear that the serious legal uncertainty that this bill introduces puts at risk freedom of opinion and expression something that no Democrat should tolerate Therefore while agreeing with the need to protect those who report serious crimes and offences related to corruption corruption the health of our democracy is incompatible with supporting this bill Proof of VOX 's commitment to the fight against corruption is the registration in February 2020 of an initiative for the comprehensive protection of whistleblowers of corruption but unlike this our initiative delimits its scope exclusively to those infractions produced in the field of the public sector and from which it could result an injury to the public sector We do n't open the door to general causes Reporters of corruption must be whistleblowers of corruption and not squatters or political commissioners used to harass and accuse dissidents On the other hand there are some other details of this bill that we do not like either For example we do not like the existence of this consultative commission that creates the rule because it introduces more bureaucracy and therefore more political spending Nor do we like the system you are proposing to appoint the independent authority because we believe that its independence is not adequately guaranteed That is why in one of our amendments we propose and propose that it be appointed by Congress and not by the Government which is what you have brought here We understand that the appointment by Congress makes it possible to broaden the scope of protection and thus to give greater security to its independence Another element that we also do not like is that the bill usurps the role that the Local Regulators Act gives to provincial parliaments especially in this case it is what it is the role of supporting small municipalities because it is an exclusive and exclusive task of provincial parliaments Finally we do not think it is right that companies should be forced to appoint a manager to assume the role of head of the internal communication system More flexibility must be given to companies to choose the person from their staff who is best qualified to perform this function be it management or be employed because the key is here in which the necessary legal preventions are established so that when the person in charge is acting in the performance of his or her duties he or she cannot be disturbed disturbed or sanctioned by his or her superiors In short we are not going to support this fraudulent transposition of a European directive because it has totalitarian tufos Look the best gift you can give all the Spaniards for Christmas is to ask forgiveness for so many years of corruption to put an end to the blow to democracy and to return everything stolen And minister let 's see if for Reyes you fulfill your retributive commitments to judges prosecutors and lawyers of justice Do you know the expression pacta sunt servanda Well let 's do it
Thank you very much Madam President Mrs Fernández you have done some historical analysis of the initiative and indeed I think that could be considered as stretching the gum that is you have copied exactly the same initiative that you have presented in the Senate and it comes from a non-legislative proposal adopted last week in the Parliament of the Canary Islands Although you spoke of two GNPs really the origin of everything is a motion for a resolution which was adopted in the debate on the state of evil so called canarian nationality By the way ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party and the PSOE I do n't know how canaries can be fooled with that of canarian nationality It is a name that has been used in the Parliament of the Canary Islands which you have given for good and I would like to know if any of you when you fill out a form where you put nationality write Canary Islands There is no canarian nationality In addition it seems that we will have to get to that autonomous police that the canaries we call guanchancha because it lacks absolute meaning it founded the Canary Coalition for greater glory of its president in order to be able to move with the helicopter and for a few more things in order to end up telling them that the Canary nationality does not exist as it has happened elsewhere in this country As far as the content of the initiative is concerned we have tabled two amendments and of course it has thanked all the amendments but it has not been agreed with us The first is for technical reasons because points 1 and 4 are absolutely redundant because they say exactly the same thing with different words so I understand that one of them should be deleted In paragraph 3 they insist on the creation of a joint committee of the Government of the Canary Islands and the Government of Spain to monitor and evaluate the subsidies provided for the transport aid of the Canary Islands But ladies and gentlemen of the Canary Islands the aid we can have in our capacity as the outermost region of the European Union is not specific to the Canary Islands but is specific and negotiated by the Kingdom of Spain because you will know I suppose that the subjects of original law in the field of international relations are the States and not the regions Therefore the only one with the competence to monitor and evaluate such aid is the State the Kingdom of Spain On the other hand I think that the aid provided for in this framework of the outermost region of the European Union is very good but it needs to be updated Indeed it is accelerating by the pandemic and the rather high inflation that we are suffering but we need to update them We must do so I think it is very good that you demand it but perhaps after you have been in the Canary Islands for almost three decades what we need to do more is to create a framework where economic activity can be developed and not just for a few because for example you did not want to talk about the AIEM which is something we have in the Canary Islands something that you have promoted and protected for your business friends very little It is quite contrary to the tax of the rich of which they so much like to talk to those on the left It is a tax that all canaries pay to help very few friends of the Canary Coalition Finally they are blaming this Government for its lack of work which it has said was not going to leave anyone behind Be clear because this government is here for your support It is true that his partner did not want to support him in the investiture and cost him a sanction but be clear What is the position of Coalition Canaria I understand that if it was sanctioned it is because they want to support this Government And they also supported him when the motion of censure came forward not proving it and they have supported him on many other occasions Be clear because Spain wants to decide and has to have clear ideas Thank you very much
"Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen the natural disaster caused by the volcano of La Palma was the perfect occasion for the Social Communist Government of President Sánchez to amend at least at the very least the progressive deterioration of his image by over motivating since the beginning of the legislature the betrayal of the electoral promises not to agree with the Communists of Podemos or with the Filoetatras of Bildu the Delcygate scandal and the thousand versions of Minister Ábalos the unconstitutionality of the states of alarm and the kidnapping of Congress the invasion of the mafias of illegal immigration the rapprochement of terrorists to approve the budgets and a long et cetera It was the perfect opportunity to fulfill at least in favor of a very small number of Spaniards with that slogan of do not leave anyone behind with which they have deceived the Spaniards since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic It was the perfect occasion but President Sánchez for all he has served is to show off his complete ineptitude to solve the problems of the Spaniards So many times in Falcon the president and ministers for what Nothing at all It is not a personal opinion it is a general opinion ladies and gentlemen I am surprised that those who are theoretically representatives of the people and especially of the palm trees are so satisfied with this situation because it is not the reality Yesterday the palm trees went out into the street after a month that the volcanic activity ended to highlight the drama that the palm trees live On October 28 they also interviewed an illustrious resident of La Palma at COPE Lanzarote just before he touched me and I was lucky enough to hear these words I literally read You have n't got a euro from the administrations you have n't got a euro from the administrations It 's been over 40 days and the ones that 's left You do n't have to be there so much you have to figure it out and point it out That hassle over the journeys in the Falcon in order not to solve anything is manifested by a gentleman named Jerónimo Saavedra I do n't know if he sounds to them a declared Mason President of the Government of the Canary Islands twice minister and I do n't know if he is still a socialist militant As for the content of the actual decree that is intended to be validated today it is inevitable for me to highlight the difference between how the Spaniards who have suffered this drama and the non-Spanishs whose need is not even to be believed It will be one more edition of mathematics to progress First elemental premise money is a scarce and therefore limited resource Well for those who have lost everything total destruction of habitual housing the only thing that is expected is 60 480 euros That money is the one that will receive a family that has stayed on the street with nothing On the other side of the comparison we see how illegal immigrants who violate our borders and refuse to provide any documentation and information the State rewards them by financing their stay in establishments at 120 euros a day Remember the figure only in 126 days four immigrants have consumed exactly the same amount They do n't have to worry about where they 're going to sleep where they 're going to have breakfast or where they 're going to eat And there are already more than 40,000 illegal immigrants who have arrived in the last two years in the Canary Islands Make the numbers if they 're capable As they so like to quote Pope Francis despite being declared persecutors of the Church as laymen and communists I will tell you a fundamental aspect of the Catholic doctrine that any child of the first year of catechesis of first communion knows to see if they fall off the horse indeed today Christians celebrate the conversion of the Apostle Paul I guess you 'll know that charity is ordered by definition because if it 's not ordered by definition it would n't be a virtue anymore it would become a perversion like a perverted father who snatches bread from his hungry children to give it to those who do n't even know it With the treatment that was being given to illegal immigrants in three and four star hotels the Canary Islands had been imagining and thinking about what would happen when the Canary Islands again had another fire or catastrophe Will they put us back in the pavilions Indeed that was what happened The day after the eruption I was there in La Palma in the El Fuerte quarter and they did not let me in precisely because that difference of treatment was evident I am also obliged to remind your lords of the People 's Party that their pact with the PSOE to distribute the Cabildo de La Palma and the City of Santa Cruz de La Palma as they did in Lanzarote has left the palm trees completely orphaned by public representatives who fight for their interests in the face of the meekness of the amount of the aid and the delay in its processing For this reason Minister Bolaños is allowed here today to praise the president of the Cabildo de La Palma in the same way that Pablo Iglesias congratulated Pablo Casado on the motion of censure Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Parliamentary Group you have betrayed your voters by giving up any opposition just so that you can stay in the Government 's armchairs Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party they lie when they say that they are the opposition to the PSOE they lie blatantly and that farce makes their betrayal even more serious With a government of socialists and communists we do not even aspire to improve aid for illegal immigrants but we do demand that it be at least the same amount Although he has forgotten his main obligation is to help and protect the Spaniards and if they are not willing to do so what they have to do is resign call elections and allow the Spaniards to put them in their place for their lies and betrayals Thank you very much"
Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen in this Title VII which we are debating now only two amendments have been tabled to Rule 93 and 113 which have been rejected by the Government and I will therefore make no reference to them The presentation of the draft law of the general budgets of the State the so called yellow book in relation to this Title VII gives a very eloquent data regarding the situation to which we have arrived I am sure that quotes As a result of this process of decentralization in Spain today more than 43 of public expenditure is managed by autonomous communities and local corporations while the central administration without including the funds of Social Security manages approximately 23 of total expenditure closure quotes Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party and the PSOE for the joy of the nationalists enemies of Spain have surrendered the once solid Spanish state and diluted it in a realm of taifas with very serious consequences This level of decentralization of the State was not even remotely in the mind of the 1978 Constituent Legislator who illuminated the possibility of setting up autonomous communities for a few territories with the naive belief that the few nationalist at the time conformed to a certain level of self government This naive and therefore guilty confidence of the constituent was soon betrayed by the continued and dissatisfiedness of those nationalists who continue to show today that they will always want something more The last example we had a few days ago as soon as President Sánchez made public that he made the rule of law before Catalan coupsmen by eliminating the criminal type of sedition Mr Rufián declared that that was not enough and set the new target on the type of embezzlement In this context the most disloyal to Spain have always benefited Why do PP and PSOE presidents strive to surrender to those who attack Spain from within It is a shame that we are left alone in this battle In the Canary Islands they are already responsible for the People 's Party announcing their post-election pacts with the Canary Coalition Are you not aware ladies and gentlemen of the serious damage that Spain is causing to achieve or maintain quotas of power in public institutions How far are they willing to betray Spain How long Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party and the PSOE you have shown that since the nationalists do not limit their demands you do not limit your betrayal of Spain for its spurious and miserable party interests For the PSOE this betrayal has a particularly striking hue those who claim to promote equality have contributed to the development of the largest generator of inequalities in the national territory the autonomous communities which have dedicated themselves to multiplying inequalities and discrimination due to the territory of residence in many areas such as taxation education and public health We are now seeing this in the area of complaints about the management of public health in some autonomous communities The differences between communities should be ashamed to rule by preaching equality among the Spaniards His betrayals have exceeded any moral limit I cannot forget the speech in this very rostrum of my colleague Antonio Salvá the father of Diego Salvá the civilian guard killed by ETA in which he manifested the pain that caused him to see the political representatives of the terrorist band ETA no longer only on the street but in institutions like this House charging a public salary People 's Party and PSOE agreed on a Political Parties Act to exclude from the institutions the promoters of violence against the Spaniards and their institutions and the same parties PP and PSOE agreed on a Constitutional Court that betrayed the Spaniards undermining the work of the security forces and bodies of the State and the judiciary They opened the door of institutions to the miserable and cowardly murderers of so many innocent Spaniards including without deceiving themselves the betrayal of their own victims and their families How far are they willing to go When will the minutes of the negotiation with ETA that we have requested be made public The Spaniards have the right to know the price you put on our dignity All this is not postulated by left or right but by common sense They have left us to those of VOX but more and more Spaniards are opting for this political instrument at the service of Spain which does not promote a Spain divided into sides but defends the union of all Spaniards on basic and essential issues in our life such as food security health the defense of private property religious freedom freedom of thought freedom of choice in relation to the education of children and a long series of fundamental rights and freedoms that have been taken away from the Spaniards and silenced in the political debate VOX has come to reopen these debates which the consensus of the People 's Party and the PSOE considered closed in order to recover these fundamental rights and freedoms in favour of all Spaniards regardless of their political convictions It is clear from the foregoing that the State of self government in no way assists in the efficient management of the services to be provided by public administrations The state of autonomy has been the mine in which the political class has found the line to develop a mastodontic welfare state for its comrades friends and family replicating state structures and institutions that no Spanish would miss if closed tomorrow It has also been the battlefield in which PP and PSOE have surrendered to Spain in favor of the nationalists who want to break it and it has been the rake in which equality and peace among the Spaniards has been given In VOX we will give that battle until the last consequences on the political the judicial and the social There is no other solution we must dismantle the autonomous state and give back to the Spaniards their unity their dignity and their money Thank you very much
Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen first of all I should like to refer to the amendments which have been maintained and which will be voted on in advance of the opinion With regard to Amendment No 30 by Mr Bel Accensi and Mrs Cañadell Salvia for the deletion of Article 13.2 k it seems reasonable to us that the current wording represents a genuine sanctioning disproportionateness and is inconsistent with the limitation of business risk Amendment 41 of the People 's Parliamentary Group assumes the postulates of VOX against the regulatory differences generated by the autonomous communities We congratulate you ladies and gentlemen on the fight against the autonomous state which only generates inequality and division among the Spanish The Republican Group with its amendments 42 and 44 aligned with Mrs Illamola Dausà 's amendment 8 and 43 reiterates the non-law proposal on the increase of gambling tax and the limitation of its advertising discussed already in this plenary session on 30 November 2021 The initiative repeated today was only intended to deepen the disruptive factor of the autonomous state so we will vote against it All this as far as the bottom is concerned With regard to the forms I am obliged to stress the complete absence of the debate proper to the handling of any legislative initiative the absence of debate imposed by the groups supporting in this House the coalition of the Social Communist Government of President Sánchez These parliamentary groups once again converted the first meeting of the Paper into the only session of the Paper The institutional abuse that represents the absence of parliamentary debate has been accomplished with forms lacking not only in the minimum parliamentary courtesy and elementary education but also in the fulfilment of the obligations of parliamentary procedure by failing to make known beforehand the texts which were intended to be included in the report of the House by stealing the reading and the debate of the same as provided for in Rule 72.2 of the Rules of Procedure of this House Another example of an anomalous and anti-democratic development has been the inclusion of the five amendments of the Socialist Parliamentary Group and the Confederal Group of the United Nations We can say that as the lawyer has stated in the paper 's report they do not seem to meet the requirements of homogeneity and congruence with the draft law in accordance with the doctrine of the Constitutional Court The Bureau should have ignored them by rating them What is the relationship between the prosecution of tax fraud and the manipulation of sports betting which is the subject of this bill and the reform of the sanctioning regime of the General Law for the Defense of Consumers and Users Well absolutely no relationship The abdication of the Bureau 's obligation to monitor amendments before they are adopted significantly affects the handling of the legislative initiatives of this House How far will the degradation of the highest institutions of the State by the parties that support this social communist government go As for the claimed majority which is a recurring appeal by the parliamentary groups that support the Frankenstein Government to justify these democratic abuses I must remind you that the majority that have formed in this Congress of Deputies has been the result of the lie and betrayal not only of President Sánchez but of each and every member of the Socialist Parliamentary Group because during the election campaign they repeatedly promised their voters that they would not agree with Unite Podemos or Bildu Therefore ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Parliamentary Group your majority lacks all legitimacy as it is the result of the deception of the Spanish people the sole holder of national sovereignty of which you by your deception and betrayal have become unworthy and illegitimate representatives I appeal to all those socialist parliamentarians to show a minimum of dignity and commitment to the PSOE voters They owe a minimum of fidelity to their electoral promises and therefore have to oppose the manoeuvres of the autocrat President Sánchez for the destruction of the rule of law and the separation of powers Each of you is held responsible for everything that happens as you continue to give your votes to the betrayal of the Socialist Party voters leaving them in the hands of the most radical and sectarian left represented by the Communist Party the ideology responsible for hundreds of millions of crimes in the past 20th century They have also been abandoned in the hands of those who jail honor and represent the ruthless assassins of ETA and finally in the hands of those who with another attempt at a coup d'état against the territorial integrity of Spain are constantly threatening us Your votes ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Parliamentary Group in the service of the autocrat President Sánchez serve only to keep President Sánchez travelling in Falcon while the Spaniards cannot afford to pay for their cars petrol and are increasingly struggling to access basic food and goods Stop the maneuvers of destruction of the democratic rule of law such as the assault on the Constitutional Court the last guarantee to the repeated abuse of the fundamental freedoms and rights of the Spaniards that President Sánchez claims with the help of the People 's Party Ladies and gentlemen I 'm not asking you for anything you have n't done before I will read you the October 1 2016 column of the PSOE newspaper After a dramatic day with screams cries and insults it came to eight and twenty o'clock in the evening when Sanchez agreed that the members of the federal committee would vote hand in hand on his proposal to hold a primaries to elect the secretary general He was defeated by 132 votes against and 107 in favour a minute later he announced his resignation Ladies and gentlemen you have the opportunity to obtain the just solution of these Courts and the convening of elections that would allow the Spaniards to exercise their legitimate right to elect representatives worthy of their trust From VOX we will continue to put all legal political and social means in place to put an end to this government 's lies ruin and misery Thank you very much
Thank you very much Mr President Ladies and gentlemen Mrs Oramas today we are debating your non-law proposal registered on 24 February concerning the volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma which began on 19 September 2021 and which was declared to be completed on 25 December almost four months ago Mrs Oramas it 's better late than never but time in these kinds of natural disasters is key From the VOX Parliamentary Group we recorded a non-law proposal on September 21 2021 that is two days after the volcanic eruption began As for the timing of your initiative Mrs Oramas but as far as the substance is concerned it is on a single page of the Official Gazette of the Courts General and I would like to read briefly The Congress of Deputies urges the Government of Spain to launch a programme of economic recovery in La Palma which includes in depth aid lost to cover the current and future needs of companies until the economic recovery is complete preferential loans to cover infrastructure costs necessary to recover the activity or to convert the companies in cases where it is impossible to continue the activity as proposed and finally to include palm companies as preferential in all the business or economic support activities that are being launched by the Government of Spain Our initiative registered only two days later is eight times more extensive and urges the Government to fulfil its obligation which is to put all means at its disposal to help the affected immediately and to take as many actions as necessary to offer certainty and hope to the future of the palm trees We are talking about the necessary declaration of the area affected by a civil protection emergency the urgent adoption of a package of exceptional measures the urgent processing of administrative files relating to the measures agreed as a result of the declaration of the area seriously affected the immediate setting up of the coordinating committee which unfortunately was not set up until a month later the assessment of the damage with all the necessary information and the request for aid from the European Union Solidarity Fund On this last point as in many others the opacity of this Government motivated the question of Mr Buxade Villalba MEP for VOX on 3 February to know whether the Government of Spain had sent to the European Commission the damage assessment required for the activation of the aid and its amount if so and whether the Government of Spain had requested an advance in order to be able to provide aid to those affected as soon as possible I insist that in catastrophic situations like the one we occupy time is key Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Group time is key and palm trees need action Mrs Oramas we have recorded an amendment with three aspects firstly it is a question of establishing the immediate nature of the measure in question secondly our amendment covers the various forms of business activity which your initiative involves in the end companies seeking to avoid unfair exclusions in the processing of aid and finally we eliminate the discrimination that the classification of palmera might entail to businesses self employed and entrepreneurs who are domiciled outside the island of La Palma and who have also been affected and deserve such aid I trust Mrs Oramas that you will accept our amendments Finally Mrs Oramas I am obliged to show you my doubts and concerns about the position of your party the Canary Coalition with regard to the management of the disaster You Mrs Oramas with very good judgment did not support the investiture of a social communist government which presupposed the arrival of communists to the Government of Spain also the consummation of electoral fraud by the betrayal and lies of candidate Sánchez about the partners of government Although you acted with good judgment not supporting the investiture the truth is that your party had given you another indication and that is why you received disciplinary consequences With this background Mrs Oramas although I congratulate you on your common sense I find myself under an obligation to demonstrate that the Canary Coalition is an ideologically drifting party For the Spaniards and I conclude Mr President who are willing to work in freedom both in Madrid and in the Canary Islands only VOX is left Thank you very much
Good afternoon When we first saw this popular legislative initiative I must admit that we read it with great interest for affecting a matter as high a priority for VOX as the Mar Menor What seemed to be an innocent legislative initiative turned out to be an attack on the Constitution the most elementary laws and human rights a Bolshevik experiment to abolish with the always excuse of the environment the rule of law in one part of Spain and we assume that to extend it to the rest as I will explain below It considered it relevant to include previous presentations in this plenary on the same subject Throughout the Mediterranean there are only two geographical phenomena that unlike lagoons lakes or albuferas receive virtually all of their sea water one is the Chica Sea next to Melilla and the other is the Minor Sea in Murcia This uniqueness causes the Sea Minor to be subjected to two impacts On the one hand the human impact which is the least of them as I will explain later and which is due to two main causes tourism and agriculture which are not by far the greatest threat to the Minor Sea On the other hand the impact of nature is a factor that is in danger and it is one that can make the Minor Sea completely disappear and it is due to the problem of the constant landing of the gorges which communicate it with the Mediterranean and the ramblas resulting from the rivers and torrential rains I will try to explain all this problem that I have outlined and its solutions The Mar Menor has an area of 13 500 hectares and 630 cubic hectares of salt water an average depth of 4.4 metres although the maximum is slightly more than 6 These 630 cubic hectometers have the following flow on the one hand there are losses of water that evaporate Annually they are about 220 cubic hectometers which therefore would be the amount that must enter to keep its volume stable and that does not overflow or dry On the other hand with regard to the contributions of water they come from the Mediterranean 190 cubic hectometers through the gorges which thanks to the minister 's incompetence and the abandonment of functions of the government of the Moroccan PP are closing Rivers and rains contribute 20 cubic hectometres that carry 10 of suspended solids which cause a slow sedimentation that causes the coast to have stolen land from the sea especially in the area of El Algar and Los Alcázares and there are phenomena such as the Rame Tower formerly a watchtower of pirate attacks being already 2 kilometers inland 2 cubic hectometres are brought by the black waters mainly overflowing with municipal scrubbers and 8 cubic hectometres by the infiltration of agricultural irrigation What problems do these contributions present and how to deal with them The contribution of 190 cubic metres of the Mediterranean does not present any problems but it is essential for the Sea Minor not to dry out The 20 cubic hectometers of the rivers and their suspended solids do pose a problem of long term landing which can be solved as was done in Cartagena with the Rambla del Hondon which drowned the fishing port and diverted to the Mediterranean The 2 cubic hectometres of black water from PP and PSOE municipal sanitation are the most serious problem And we come to the 8 cubic hectometres of agricultural irrigation which are irrelevant and it is the excuse that this government was seeking and the consensus is progressing one to comply with its dogmatic agenda and another to throw balloons out to continue to chair and criminalize the farmers of Levante with useless and purposeless laws like the one they want to pass today By the way all groups of ecologists in the Murcia Region lied that farmers were guilty of the supposed degradation of the Lesser Sea because they poured 90 cubic hectometers at it The face of reality was given by the ministry itself and Tragsa with a demolishing study that reduced the catastrophic expectations of these groups by leaving it alone on 8 cubic hectometres Conclusion from VOX we propose the following solutions cheap fast effective and definitive irrefutable for VOX in any government or agreement First the opening of the throat and its maintenance at the levels of the fifties or sixties considered the golden age of the Mar Menor This government has closed it to create an alleged ecological hecatombe in an area where they do not govern and are guilty of the death of tons of fish who died looking for oxygen in the throat of Marchamalo which they had closed Secondly install mandatory rain separative sanitation in all PP and PSOE municipalities in the area which are the major culprits of what is spilled Thirdly the construction of a perimeter ditch around the Sea Minor whose preliminary draft we have already brought here which makes nitrate filter brine etc Fourthly draw up a zero salm plan allowing farmers to install ventilators to dispose of all these products And fifthly the diversion of the ramblas to the Mediterranean So far the simple quick and cheap solutions that VOX proposes in the face of its delirious totalitarian projects for this area of Spain such as the one they bring here today and which we will repeal in the next parliamentary term from the Government of Spain There are already many state autonomous and even European administrations with competence over the Mar Menor and the adjacent territory of its basin as well as public actions in the field of urban planning and the environment for the reporting and prosecution of possible crimes against ecological heritage as well as the use of the Prosecutor 's Office the Seprona etc. which make this initiative a toast to the sun This ILP is more wasteful and more legislation rather than managing well with existing instruments and without increasing public spending There is no more pretension than to create a new anti-democratic and totalitarian chiringuito that operates outside the laws and the suffrage of the Spaniards as I will explain below The first time I was aware of this initiative was in Murcia in the square of Santo Domingo when a group of people collected signatures to save the Sea Minor A crowd gathered around the table lent themselves in good faith led by good intentions to sign that request for help to save this unique enclave without further proof of what they were signing I had the occurrence of asking and I was stunned when I was told what the signatures were for to give legal personality to the Mar Menor I thought it was such nonsense that I continued to walk thinking that such a legal misconception would have no way until today that they bring here this nonsense dressed in popular initiative supported by all the ruling extremism and the shameful submission of the People 's Party to the suspension of the rule of law in this area of Spain depending on it among other rights private property and free enterprise As nothing that has happened lately in the Minor Sea is innocent I saw that they repeated the typical left wing move that we have seen so many times in this Parliament to present extreme left wing activists as independent technicians in the matter to be discussed We saw it in the Commission of the COVID when the independent expert was nothing less than Monica García of More Madrid and here they repeat played They catch a specialist person also dressed as an independent expert together with other people all known activists of Podemos and try to bring back the deception that what is presented here is a peremptory necessity and a social demand endorsed by scientists when it is nothing more than an attempt to create a new chiringuito dominated by the extreme left to steal funds to squander our pockets and take advantage of the good faith of citizens escaping any democratic control I fully agree with you on one thing that you say in the explanatory statement that all measures all ideological laws all attempts to perpetuate the problem in order to fill themselves with the subsidies proposed by the left the anti-system ecologists and the progress consensus have served no purpose And to avoid it they bring us another chiringuito like all those who have been creating for decades so far in the form of expert groups observatories and other words As I said moreover it is a legal nonsense but you who teach VOX about democracy do not care very much because you skip the laws to the bullfighter as in this case article 35 of the Civil Code and a comprehensive and profuse Spanish and European legislation that invalidates your proposal without entering into all the terrible for the freedom it hides In its proposal they question the rule of law by saying that environmental law no longer serves to protect nature and that alternatives to the law which is the foundation of the democratic state must be sought They give rights to the Mar Menor which is similar to when Caligula wanted to appoint his horse Incitatus consul of Rome I guess we 'll soon see him listed for voting or signing contracts at the Mar Menor itself They create chiringuitos where they have the decision making majority about the environment people like you who do n't answer to anyone about their management and stuff themselves with our money The rights of fish crustaceans plants organisms and the different elements that integrate and interact are fundamental to you in equality or superiority in relation to the exercise of fundamental human rights in the area To be equal in rights to animals to be devoid as they have done in other legislative nonsense of any vestige of humanity of any value to the miracle of man 's life of everything that makes us exceptional and unrepeatable and underpins the freedom and democracy of each of us to be equal in rights and obligations to plants and pets If we leave them we will soon see a cat or a horse voted with the Mar Menor in that collective madness in which they find themselves Laws in which it is cheaper to haul a machete to a human being than to cut off the ear for hygiene to a pet You use the Sea Minor for your globalist plans and climate agendas which prohibit transfers That is why they want to ban agriculture in the Minor Sea to close de facto the transfer of the Tagus because simply they no longer have any land to water VOX will always denounce their manipulations and attacks on freedom Only VOX can close your bars and quickly solve the problems of the Sea Minor that all of you have created on the basis of bad faith incompetence or cowardice and we will do so without the agency of placement of incompetents who slip our pockets because only VOX is left Thank you
Thank you very much Franco finally showed up in the room it was late Franco I do n't know if he is but Bildu I see there Republican Left there Podemos there Communist parties there all the anti-system there all the enemies of Spain there those I do see Franco I do n't know where he is but those are all sitting there including the ETA which I see in the background First of all since it has not given a single argument nor has it overturned one of the proposals beyond saying nonsense about science and so on what brings VOX here are scientific studies they are studies presented by engineers of Caminos Canales and Ports they are preliminary projects they are serious things Here I have seen nothing but generality vagueness and genuine nonsense of cancelling the rule of law in these areas of Spain I would also like to remind all the Spanish victims of the storms and of course my best wishes of course to those in the area of the Mar Menor and Cabo de Palos because these torrential rains have exceeded the scrubbers of their municipalities which has caused a new discharge of black waters to the Mar Menor after decades without doing anything as we have proposed to them since VOX I 'm going to keep insisting In addition to the ramblas they have poured into the Sea Minor new tons of mud that fill the tail competence of the PSOE government and Podemos preventing water from entering the Mediterranean Sea for the regeneration of that unique environment that you want to collapse It is their environmental hecatombe to criminalize agriculture the worst the better to see if they touch power where they do not take a vote If we are already on the basis that man is equal in animal rights because we must not forget what is being discussed here what is this that man is equal in animal rights and that ecosystems are even above the law the rule of law and people as you say it will not be surprising that donkeys deer or some wild boar end up being mayors because if they are so equal they will also have the right to vote and to be elected in their crazy logic I 've already announced yes that VOX is only going to take people on their lists Put whatever you want in yours It is also tremendous that two parties such as Citizens and the People 's Party have shown their enthusiasm for this legislative aberration I am going to be generous and I am going to think that genuine in the face of the moral superiority of this left that in which they believe they have not even read it because it is a bestial limitation of fundamental rights in the area including private property as acknowledged by the rapporteur who intended together with restrictions on more freedoms such as business the creation of criminal types without reforming the Penal Code I do not think that your voters like it very much to support the creation of a soviet in the Minor Sea managed by an agency above the administrations and the state itself and that of the thirteen members who make up it always have the decision making majority characters like the extreme left and its head ecologists who know nothing about the Minor Sea except that we have to sovietize That 's why I say I have n't heard a single argument beyond what we 're used to as fascists etc. and bring back who we all know If I have to say in view of the fact that I have not been struck by anything I have said or denied that the totalitarian content of this ILP is the one I am denouncing here on behalf of my parliamentary group which so far has been my intervention We have made a rigorous presentation of the problem and of easy cheap and common sense solutions for the Lesser Sea He has not been able to forward our proposals to us with arguments except with his disqualifications I am already telling you that we will repeal this nonsense when we govern the next legislature along with all the laws criminalizing agriculture and all its chiringuitos that have been approved by the cowardice of the popular government of Murcia and suicidal dogmatism for Spain from all over the left We 'll restore sanity and hope because there 's only VOX left Thank you very much
"Good afternoon This motion is the result of an amendment to the budgets within the so called Framework for Priority Actions for the Recovery of the Sea Minor With it they intend first to create a technical office for the conservation of this enclave with millionaire endowment and that they say it will be composed in principle by two officials and public enterprises but later on they already speak of contracted personnel that I imagine it will be composed of their usual associates and it will be another agency of placement of plugs and another unusable chiringuito more than will fix only the pocket of its graceful components They speak of subjecting their operation to the totalitarian ILP of the Mar Menor that we will take to the courts because it is an attack on the Constitution and the freedom and only aims to carry out a communist experiment with which to abolish freedom in that part of Spain by means of a chiringuito dominated by the extreme left and by characters and associations that do not present themselves to the elections to govern the legal personality of the Mar Menor and by the way its municipalities apart from the Government the administrations and the popular vote abolishing private property because they intend to make them houses of the beach an administrative concession and freedom of enterprise consecrating the disparate that ecosystems and animals are on equal rights with man who ceases to be the protagonist of the laws which are humanized Human life is devalued relativized as in all its laws This is the emergency they 're talking about This chiringuito will study in 2023 the deadlines for the implementation such as the framework of priority actions of the Government which are so high priorities that they need a chiringuito to see if they have begun two years after announcing them with great propaganda And finally if you finish the previous bicoca your plug in will continue to operate to spread what they call the Mar Menor brand But the proof that you 've never stepped on the Lesser Sea is when you end up saying that your goal is to close the artificially created gorges to avoid what you call sweetening Given the chiringuito and its intention to end the gorges I 'm going to give the keys to what the climate emergency is or I do n't know what they call it the Sea Minor Of the 630 cubic metres of the Sea Minor they are lost by evaporation and filtration every year 220 cubic metres and only by the gorges 190 cubic metres enter If we do the nonsense they say it 'll dry out in less than four years That 's a climate emergency but it 's getting them out of the government as soon as possible too With the closure of the gorges which are the canals linking the Mediterranean with the Lesser Sea which you opened and regenerated and which today you have closed and whose key has swallowed the minister you intend to artificially create an environmental hecatombe turning the Lesser Sea into a sunbathing with its green waters for lack of circulation That minister who never comes to the things of the Mar Menor being secretary of state with the government of Zapatero dredged in 2011 the golad Marchamalo with the joy of the director general of Sustainability and secretary general of the Communist Party in Murcia Pedro Antonio Ríos who boasted of the positive that it was for the Mar Menor to have cleaned the throat and reused its 22,000 cubic meters of sand in regenerating the beaches That 's how you spend it coherently Secondly with the closure of the gorges and the artificially created hecatombe with elabonan never better said the criminalization of Murcian agriculture They blame farmers for their negligence in managing to dismantle their farms and create a subsidized economy of captive voting in the area because they no longer give up Thirdly they intend to eradicate this agriculture from the Cartagena countryside by abolishing the transfer of the Tagus by the way of the facts since it would no longer be necessary to have no fields to water The problem is that the People 's Party remains its counterpart Therefore in just one year we will rule in Murcia and Spain we will abolish its liberticid laws and close its chiringuitos we will open the gorges as in the sixties we will make a perimeter filtration ditch we will impose separational sanitation we will eliminate the brine and we will divert the ramblas to the Mediterranean Because there 's only VOX left and more Spaniards know it every day Thank you very much"
Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Ladies and gentlemen this is what almost all of you want from the victims of terrorism our silence A permanent silence for the mourning of our family murdered by ETA They also want the silence of the terrorists and their accomplices when they pay tribute to the terrorists by celebrating the prize of that advanced freedom but they want the silence of those terrorists not because they humiliate the victims of terrorism they want it so that they do not complicate to all of you what they have agreed with ETA That is why I have to define that this proposal for a law is partly a fraud and not because it is set out in it that it is necessary and improveable that is why we will vote that it is because it aims to simulate by giving more protection to the victims of terrorism while the events that have taken place since 2004 and continuously by all governments show that all the laws that you have passed have been in order not to comply with them Make the law make the trap Some acting like a good cop and some acting like a bad cop But then we found out that in privacy Rajoy was telling Zapatero do what you have to do and you 're telling me Ladies and gentlemen on these same dates precisely one floor in the pamphlet of the proetara newspaper Gara said that the process was going to be very long that it would have to wear those approaches and those discharges with supposed legality and that it would be dripping Drop the drop so it does n't generate social alarm And that drip of treason and indignity has become a permanent jetty when you have approached five terrorists every week Five for each of the votes of the representatives of the etarra party that we have here Some of you will support this law so that the agreements adopted in the negotiation with ETA do not cause you any problems of social alarm and can carry it out others however do not conceal it and directly say they will vote against it It 's normal they 've never been closer to the victims Some are picking nuts are n't they gentlemen of the PNV and others even sharing walks with terrorist Otegi And during all these years with the various laws that have been passed to protect the victims a new victim has been generated that victim is the truth The truth that only VOX only VOX has requested here in Congress and in the courts which are the minutes of negotiation with ETA We 're left alone And we are left alone because you could hardly justify if it were to come to light everything that has been negotiated Because remember the tributes that have been made have been with the majority of all governments Unwarranted imprisonment has been carried out with all Governments Do you remember Bolinaga What a disappointment we 've had many victims Unwarranted approaches have been carried out with all Governments Not persecuting terrorists to pay their debt to the State for their attack as reflected in this non-legislative proposal is something that has happened to all Governments Prison benefits to terrorists without complying with the requirement to cooperate with the justice system have been carried out with all Governments It is a disappointment as a victim and I hope ladies and gentlemen that this new law will help you to rectify the drift you have carried over all these years Ladies and gentlemen if there is a permanent tribute in this Congress that we suffer the victims of terrorism are those five representatives of a party of ages of ages like Otegi or as the newly incorporated head of ETA David Pla If you are sitting here it is because you have all consented not to apply the Party Law despite the evidence that the Civil Guard had and you have done absolutely nothing Ladies and gentlemen of the PSOE if you want to dignify the victims and do them justice you have it easy start by ceasing the unworthy and treacherous Minister Marlaska and the secretary of prisons Mr Ortiz by trading with the murderers of ETA I know you wo n't because you 're more than your partner the PSOE representative in Burgos says you have to forgive the murderers How generous and how kind you are all Right They are and do n't hesitate to trade with the sacrifice of so many victims and you know why they do it Because they 're not their loved ones they 're not their children That 's why they have n't bothered to shake hands in the pact with ETA and have stained them with blood with the blood of our loved ones None of them none of that blood was your children's otherwise you sure as hell would n't have done it Memory dignity and justice is the flag of VOX it has also been my flag as a victim and we will continue to carry it and in memory of one of the people who has fought the most for that memory dignity and justice and in his honor also for my wife Mamen Thank you
Thank you President First I would like to join of course in welcoming the delegation of the Courts of Aragon to this Congress and in particular my colleague Santiago Morón This reform of the Aragon Autonomy Statute on the elimination of the severances of members of the Courts and the Aragon Government to be tried by the High Court of Justice of Aragon or where appropriate the Supreme Court in line with what has been adopted on previous occasions with respect to other autonomous statutes and the fixing of a minimum number of deputies with representation in Courts namely 14 per province was essential As for the first question it was essential because we have a clear example of how the prerogative of afforestation the prerogative of afforestation had become an unacceptable privilege and a legal and political distortion which in turn had resulted in a democratic degeneration I am referring to what has been happening with the Government of Catalonia since 2014 A first illegal consultation only merited the conviction of Artur Mas then president of the Generalitat for disobedience by the Supreme Court of Justice of Catalonia freeing himself from the penalty of imprisonment for embezzlement of public funds when later this was claimed by the Court of Auditors itself to return these public funds improperly used in this consultation In other words there was privileged treatment of the then President of the Catalan Government Then in the trial of the trial we meet with some defendants finally convicted by the Supreme Court who claimed as active and passive the competence of the Superior Court of Catalonia thinking that there they will find an equally privileged treatment for their beating behaviors And finally that feeling of impunity we have today A few days ago Mr Pere Aragonès publicly stated that Catalonia will vote for independence in the hope that the suffocation once again could serve as a parapet to unthinkable conduct in a modern democracy By the way a gentleman named Aragonès who supports a consultation for the breakup of Spain and who does so from Catalonia often has this gentleman 's mental cocoa The explanatory statement of this reform proposal is correct when it states that suffocation is a legal figure perceived by the majority of society as anachronistic typical of past times which today hardly fits into article 14 of the Spanish Constitution which enshrines the principle of equal citizenship before the law I add more so when such a degenerate use is made of it in the Government of Catalonia as I have already explained But this statement of reasons has not been so clear as to warn an important detail that the elimination of the hindrances in short is a reversal a full recovery to the State of competence to judge and execute the judgment in accordance with the rules that apply to the rest of the Spaniards Because here what is relevant to the independence forces was not so much in the referral to the Supreme Court in their case which of course would not be done by system but in attempts to appropriate the judicial competence of the higher courts of justice by those autonomous governments led by independence parties who always wanted to pressure and interfere with the much needed judicial independence With this reform therefore it is fully returned to the judiciary as the power of the state its full competence to judge and execute the judged and this is something that VOX has been maintaining since its foundation With regard to the second question of reform it is equally clear that depopulation can never mean the nullification of any representative political capacity and influence of a province and we also think that this reform is appropriate on this point In short we will vote in favour of the reform proposal Thank you very much
Thank you so much Minister your government has transferred powers in prison matters to the Basque Country which means that the autonomous government that is the PNV decides on third grades and prison permits and you have previously decided on the second There 's the trap At the same time you 're moving the criminal etarras to the Basque prisons I mean he 's giving them a covert pardon ETA killed more than 800 people Of these murders 378 have not yet been solved one of them is my son's Of course none of the ages to which you grant covert pardon has revealed key details for resolving those crimes Moreover when one of these murderers is released his Bildu partners cheer them and organize parties in his honor Meanwhile the victims of ETA rot in oblivion Their servile attitude and PSOE 's pacts with ETA are an insult to victims and good people You might as well spit in our faces explicitly Here 's my face listen to me The affront would not be greater We all knew that the PSOE is the most corrupt party in the history of Spain and Europe but what is clear now is that this corruption is not limited to economic issues It is precisely moral corruption the blood vows on which his Government is based the most vile form of corruption You say that ETA does not exist In order not to exist tributes to terrorists are becoming more frequent In fact the victims do still exist As I have already told you 378 murders one of them my son's whose executioners have not yet been identified ETA may not kill today but tributes and victims do exist We call on the Government to defend us protect us and investigate the crimes to be solved we demand memory dignity and justice Finally why do you grant these hidden pardons to ETA And to finish I have to tell you that the ETA bullet kills three times the first time the person the second time when politicians like you betray us and the third time in oblivion which is where you intend to take the victims Thank you
Mr President the conversion work of Decree Law No 50 of 17 May 2022 the so called aid decree which let us not forget takes place in a dramatic historical moment or rather falls at a particularly difficult time of a historically dramatic period which is even worse I repeat the inconvenience for the timing of the work imposed by the government and for the de facto monocameralism that I hope can soon be archived as a great constitutional force I thought my first parliamentary experience had been in a very difficult legislature the XVI with the President of the Council Berlusconi there was the earthquake of L'Aquila the great world recession started from the financial crisis of the United States the very high spread the floods the resignation of President Berlusconi in November 2011 the rise of Professor Monti with his own measures defined a few years after recession the suicides of entrepreneurs and craftsmen Well this parliamentary term is even more dramatic Many speeches have been made by colleagues in the House who have improved the text especially in favour of territories entrepreneurs and municipalities I remember the 31 million citizens receiving the 200 euro bonus I remember the one off allocation of 500 million for 2022 for self employed workers for professionals enrolled in compulsory social security schemes managed by private institutions The municipalities were allocated the residues of the Covid funds not used for facilities on the Tari and 150 million to stem the increases in energy bills temporarily giving the possibility for 2022 only to use also the proceeds of fines to stem energy costs I imagine that it will be a condition shared by all of us to be contacted every day by very worried mayors who do not know how to bear these costs how to guarantee heating in schools libraries municipal clinics municipal offices cadastral poles civic halls The mayors are already heroes as other Members have mentioned this morning but we really need to give them the opportunity to operate because they represent the institutions in trenches which every day must give convincing answers to all citizens The same dramatic phone calls come to us from the entrepreneurs who say that the bank from today does not grant them the transfer of the tax credit that they are out of 2 or 10 million that they do not make it and they skip We must give these people answers and unfortunately we do not have all the answers they need Needless to say the 110 bonus was an expansive measure because the changes that are taking place have complicated the realization of the works and even in some cases put at risk the holding of small medium and large companies really important I guess we 'll have to keep going We still come to the absurdity of the heat to energy plant You 've seen a stomachache of some unintelligible Waste management remains a disgrace to Rome and Italy as a whole due to the enormous economic environmental and image and dignity costs We need seriousness and we do not need distractions from the program of an emergency government by a majority that in another context would never have been born This week we have seen a psychodrama of which we would have gladly done without remembering that one must never fear the vote of voters and electricians I hope for more serious and responsible behaviour towards not only the institutions we represent but also and above all towards the country which is lost and with little expectations of recovery
"Mr President first of all I would like to thank all the members of the Government who followed the measure in particular the undersecretary Mr Sartore who has always been present making the trip with the MEF and the rapporteurs As has already been said by others it seems a bit anachronistic to work on a decree law passed in fact by events But in these two years there has been an acceleration of events that have upset the normal life pattern of households businesses the state and municipalities We must therefore go quickly and try to act with timely and timely measures to prevent the system from jumping We have seen that inflation has begun to grow after years of constant levels the risk is that inflation is also added to stagnation which is the worst of economic conditions But we come to what is contained in the decree law support ter and above all to the amendments that have improved the measure First of all there has been a follow up to what has already been done in the budget law for the recruitment of personnel where it was planned in the police forces and in other categories with an amendment that provides for the sliding of the rankings of the students police officers In many parts there is a demand to increase the number and presence of the police forces for the safety of the cities for the emergency Covid for the entry of Ukrainian refugees and for a thousand other things obviously these people must also be hired The adoption of a number of amendments concerning the tourism sector is also good We remember that tourism represents our oil because it is really our wealth Therefore the non-refundable appropriations for tourist buses and tour guides as well as the exemption from social security contributions for tour operators and travel agencies are good This is one of the topics on which the League has always insisted because in the absence of intervention this would have caused the default of many artisans and traders they speak of 600,000 people So it 's an absolutely positive thing There has also been an extension of the deadlines for approving the 2021 consolidated financial statements and financial statements for the reporting of the Regional Health Service aid to the Regions There was then during the discussion an episode concerning the administration contracts Although there were two amendments by Forza Italia and the League on this very subject which had received the favourable opinion both from the competent Ministry of Labour and from the MEF there was a proposal for an extension of only three months when the amendments provided for the abolition of the deadline of 30 September This proposal was voted on by the whole Commission with the exception of the League Group which voted against We believe that at this time of major labour crisis we must defend work and not facilitate redundancies I remember that 110,000 jobs are at risk and recently 450 temporary jobs were fired by Poste Italiane This is what has unfortunately happened and is incomprehensible but I would like to remind you briefly of what has not been done Mr President there was an amendment by Mr Arrigoni on the qualification of companies a non-payable and very important amendment that asked us all the categories of the construction sector because it would have allowed us to exclude all those companies that were born as mushrooms without staff that grey area in which the scam aspect could also reside This amendment like other proposals has not been completed and it has been a huge mistake because everyone was waiting for it and because it would reward serious entrepreneurs who with difficulty continue to stand and give work for real There were also other amendments such as that of Mr Briziarielli which included measures for the bodies responsible for environmental surveillance and control or that of Senator Cantù on the free professional activity of health workers It is not possible that with the work so important that it has been done despite all the time limits dictated by the haste or by the situation as I said before anachronistic it is not possible to complete the process of some absolutely good and positive proposals because they do not physically arrive at the last second the amendments We will have to take an in depth look at this It 's not acceptable"
Mr President the Economic and Financial Document is perhaps the main instrument of economic planning so it is the document that has the least certain data because it is entirely based on prospects Before moving on to the perspectives which are all contestable and objectionable I would like to start from a reasoning on a central theme of these days these weeks and these months a theme that some friend and esteemed colleague of the Democratic Party has been called the scare of taxes I am sure that this reference was not addressed to the opposition but that the colleague evoked it at the address of some of his government allies In any case I think that there is little to joke about this issue because if there is a certain fact that reports the DEF is that for the third consecutive year the tax pressure has increased so speaking of numbers we have reached 43.5 of tax pressure on GDP which already puts us in the best to use a euphemism position in Europe and because I believe that we all know how GDP also takes account of the submerged we can also imagine that if we consider the impact of tax on the legal economy with a tax pressure of 43.5 we would find ourselves at a 49 percent that would be worth the enviable record of being the country in Europe with the highest taxation in relation to GDP So when it comes to tax scare I say that taxes are an instrument that these majorities I am referring to all those who have ruled in this and in the previous legislatures have ignored too soon and faced without the due concreteness The result is a limitation to growth and development Let us not forget that we have grown by 0.7 with the tax burden 2021 on 2020 in the previous year by 0.5 and in the year before even 0.6 So for three years as an opposition we have been witnessing policies of Count 1 Count 2 and Dragons that mean growth in the tax burden Then we are told but here we are already in perspective that thanks to the wonderful interventions included in the budget law last December in 2022 we will finally have a small drop in the tax increase We will see whether this will be the case because in our view the few denarii made available by the fiscal law for tax reduction will not allow a reduction in taxation and as has been seen mainly because of indirect taxation and VAT we will probably have a tax problem in 2022 as well On these issues I call on the majority to reason and understand that without a fiscal policy instrument we can not get out of the pandemic and international crisis It seems to me that everything that is happening in the majority and in the Government in the House where there is a continual dispute over tax reform is demonstrating what the Brothers of Italy have been saying for a long time namely that in a time of difficulty and emergency we need not a Government of national unity or better of national bickering but a homogeneous Government that knows how to give a way to the country and does not have a majority and an opposition to its internal knowing how to distinguish between who is majority and is compact and who is opposition and then loyally and consistently opposition Inside you there is everything and more and so I understand the colleague when he talks about the fear of taxes to the daughter in law so that her mother in law will understand I turn to the numbers contained in the DEF and here again there is to worry The DEF compared to the previous year 's and NADEF 's numbers shows a reduction in the growth forecast 1.8 less than expected a few months ago due to the apparent international crisis situations which stands at 2.9 percent All non-party commentators and technicians i.e. non-oppositionists I can quote Professor Baldassarre Il Sole 24 Ore today and Confindustria which by definition is always government tell us that your 2.9 percent is overestimated and that the realistic growth figure for 2022 varies between 1.3 and 1.9 percent This means that we will still remain well below 2019 GDP and that in fact the country is in stagflation that is GDP does not grow but inflation increases We do not need to be Nobel laureates or academic academic academics to understand that in a state of stagflation we must intervene in a concrete way and have the courage to make very determined policies that your majority is unable to adopt for the reasons we have repeatedly said namely because you are heterogeneous In heterogeneity we do not determine a virtuous path perhaps it determines the maintenance of our seats our seats our armchairs but it is another topic In heterogeneity the interests of Italians dear friends are not taken into account This is demonstrated by the fact that there is another issue that the DEF does not consider that of the transfer of tax credits because if it really considered it other than +3 percent other than 1.3 other than 1.9 We 're going to zero We have businesses that are failing thanks to the games of this majority and this government The first political force in Parliament the 5 Star Movement fought for tax credits But then ladies and gentlemen the government does not make you a very good figure since in the text of the bill of conversion of Decree Law No 17 which we will examine tomorrow in this House Article 29 bis provides for a paragraph in which the variations to reopen the disposals of tax credits are frustrated simply saying that the new provisions will apply to communications to the Agency of revenue made after 1 May a bit like telling a sick person that he will be given the medicine for the influence that he will take tomorrow and not for what he has already taken and which he must cure The majority therefore is not only incapable of having a precise and punctual identity path for the future of the country but is not even able to impose itself with the Government We have a Parliament that would agree on so many issues and a Government that then does what it wants it ridicules you The same is true of the resolutions we are about to vote on I am sure at least having read also the resolutions presented to the House that we will agree on many points in Parliament but they are resolutions which like any simple agenda will be destroyed by your Government by the Government that you support We will continue on a road that is not the one wanted by the representatives of the people but it is probably the one indicated by other forces and by other realities which are perhaps outside of this country In conclusion Mr President this is not a virtuous path Brothers of Italy asks for seriousness and respect for Italians If you have plans have the courage to carry them forward and force the government to do what Parliament and the majority who support it decide Otherwise we 'd better all go home
Mr President Minister these days the death of an African citizen at the slum tower Antonacci is reported in Rignano Garganico in the province of Foggia following a fire that has involved the camp which has hosted for years thousands of immigrants engaged mostly in agricultural work and with a significant numerical increase during the harvest season There are more and more cases of slums tendostructures and spontaneous settlements of migrants which host people mainly employed in seasonal agricultural work on the national territory where there is a dramatic inhuman and complete abandonment situation with considerable problems related to the issues of health and public safety as well as the safety of the migrants present These settlements represent a concrete example of the difficulties of management and integration due to the numbers of immigration out of control These places pose risks of public order and health for the surrounding area and risk food for organised crime businesses as well as seriously putting the same safety of guests The labour exploitation of migrants in the agriculture sector is a scourge for our country which generates social insecurity and precariousness and feeds the black economy and organised crime Finally it must be assessed that no restrictions on landings and no serious policies of containment of exceptional migratory flows lead to an overload of the reception system which feeds the bad management of migrants on the Italian territory and the consequent abandonment on the territory of thousands of migrants mostly in the situation of irregularities In our opinion as a solution it is essential to invest in training work and assistance in order to accelerate the consequent process of voluntary returns which is able to bring benefits wealth and development to the country of origin also pursuing the concept of discouraging departures as a pillar of future immigration policies The question Minister asks whether he is aware of the numbers of spontaneous and self managed settlements of migrants present on Italian territory and what initiatives he intends to take in order to manage and put an end to this emerging situation
Mr President Minister representatives of the Government colleagues I have listened very carefully to the report and I am speaking on a specific aspect to which you Minister have devoted about a minute and a half I would say very little I am referring to Part 5.4 on family and child rights In the written text of your report and in your speech here in this House you have dealt with the many cases of violence against women and children a growing dispute in family relations Instead speaking in this Chamber he did not mention in the written text yes the feminicides which unfortunately in 2021 were 109 they are not numbers but they are women killed often mothers It 's a war bulletin I come back to the issue of family and children 's rights on which you yourself rightly pointed out that insufficient coordination between the authorities involved reduces the possibility of guessing and preventing the consequences even fatal ones and called for a thorough reform of procedures and judicial organisation Minister you also mentioned and this is the main subject of my speech a draft law adopted at the Council of Ministers in early December which rightly enjoyed thanks to a press conference in the presence of all the Ministre and President Draghi sitting in the front row in the audience a wide press review It is precisely that bill that aims to strengthen the prevention tools also to complement what is already provided for in the code red which we have also voted on but which in the application has shown to require some adjustment Moreover there is also a vulnus a hole in the reform of the criminal trial as denounced in December by the prosecutor of Tivoli compared to what happens when the person who violates the prohibition of approaching the places of attendance of the victim stops Maybe the day after the arrest is tried for direct but is released in condition as much as harm to the victim That bill of yours with eleven articles if I am not mistaken also filled this aspect that is neither marginal nor banal Minister then we wonder whether this important regulatory framework which you approved in early December and which also improves aspects of the reform of the criminal process because it contains stringent measures to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence has been boiled down We could n't find out Where did he stop Where are we You know better than I do that this measure contains very important rules and I mention only a few greater use of the electronic bracelet immediate detention in the presence of a serious risk to women strengthening of the compulsory arrest in flagrante for those who violate the above mentioned prohibition of approach to the victim in order to prevent more effectively the risk of repeated violent conduct moreover outside the arrest in flagrante of crime the precautionary measures can be applied Mr. Minister where has this bill gone The node is you have said it and you know it but unfortunately we all know it for the cases of news that we must strengthen the compulsory arrest in flagency in order to avoid what we said that is the trial by very direct and the release easy with the release in freedom of the perpetrators of violence The questions to be asked are why did this bill not come to Parliament Why has the evidence of this emergent and dramatic phenomenon not taken place Why did n't the government want to issue a decree law instead of a bill which it notoriously postpones over time However if you have done so you must bring it to the House as soon as possible we want to discuss it analyse it and approve it We do not divide ourselves on these matters but we must avoid making press conferences that are not followed by facts because we cannot afford any vacuum normative or temporal when people 's lives are at stake every day as you yourself mentioned There is no time to waste do n't waste time You mentioned Paolo Borsellino and I would like to remind you on behalf of the Brothers of Italy Group that today Paolo Borsellino is the date of his birth It is therefore a kind of birthday honor to him and his memory Minister please you have now chosen the long way of the bill rather than the way of a decree law But make this path as short as possible take it now before anything else because it serves the daily lives of many women who are in danger Mr. Minister the best are n't the ones who say The best are the ones who do what they say
"Madam President ladies and gentlemen the general state statement is the accounting document through which the Government reports to Parliament on the results of budgetary management In accordance with Articles 35 and 36 of the Law of Accounting and Public Finance the statement articulated for missions and programmes consists of two parts the balance sheet account which sets out the results of the management i.e. the actual amount of the revenue and expenditure of the State budget compared to the forecasts approved by Parliament and the general account of the assets which shows the changes in the size of the assets and liabilities constituting the assets of the State A supplementary note shall be attached to the statement of accounts for each administration For revenue the additional note sets out the results of the management The analysis of the content of the draft law shows that the management of competence achieved in 2021 a general improvement in all balances compared to the financial year 2020 In particular the net balance to be financed i.e. the difference between final revenue and final expenditure has a negative value of around 187.7 billion in 2021 an improvement of more than 83.2 billion compared to the balance recorded in 2020 Compared with the initial forecasts which indicated a negative value of the net balance of less than 193,5 billion the improvement was approximately 5.8 billion Public savings i.e. the balance of current transactions which if positive measures the share of current market resources in the financing of capital expenditure amounted to less 64.9 billion in 2021 an improvement of 40.5 billion compared to 2020 This result is determined by an increase in both current expenditure plus 22.5 billion and tax and extra-tributary revenue plus 63 billion The improvement is over 20.6 billion compared with the initial forecasts Finally the figure of the use of the financial market i.e. the difference between the final revenue and the total expenditure including those relating to the repayment of loans was less 424.4 billion in 2021 showing an improvement of 82.5 billion compared to 2020 and more than 56.3 billion compared to the initial forecasts Overall despite the continuation of the emergency by Covid 19 the results achieved with the 2021 management show an improvement for all the balances both with respect to the initial forecasts and with respect to the definitive forecasts including the deviations authorized by the Parliament The maximum limits set for the net balance to be financed and for the use of the market by the budget law for the financial year 2021 which had been indicated respectively in less € 196 billion for the net balance to be financed and in less € 483,235 billion for the use of the market were updated during the financial year by the emergency measures adopted to deal with the consequences of the epidemiological emergency by Covid 19 17.35 Following Mr Faggi rapporteur on draft law No 2682 Overall the budgetary deviation proposed by the Government to the Chambers and approved by them on 20 January 2021 with specific resolutions has re-established the maximum limits of the net balance to be financed and of the recourse to the market bringing them respectively to less 286 and less 573,235 billion euros in terms of competence Mr. President I can't talk"
Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is important fundamental for our society today more than ever disoriented and prey to unspeakable and inhumane behavior the path addressed and extensively analysed by the Femicide Commission to which my heartfelt and personal thanks go on the issue of violence against women and on how to intervene both in prevention and rehabilitation of these subjects Human evolution which has led us to be excellencies in many fields has however been inversely proportional to the manifestation of the soul 's brutishness and the dissolution of ethics rather than its growth Ethics that should be the backbone of every human action from the smallest to the most complex ethics that should be parallel to the physical and mental growth of each individual The roots of brutality have been rooted in distant times Violent behaviors could cling to a still crude society they brought with them psychological constructions that were fed in cultural and urban contexts still strongly evolutionary This is certainly not an excuse because there is never an excuse for violence of any kind committed by both men and women but it can be a consideration allow me lawful for a reasoning on why this dramatic issue which does not cease to exist Today still shows the same modus operandi of violence perhaps the instruments have changed a bit besides the hands the sticks the straps the weapons to much more the violence has been somewhat refined in its cruelty violence not only physical but also verbal and psychological Sometimes it is still difficult to understand where one begins where the other ends or vice versa If the physical one there is no doubt is more visible and often mortal the psychological one is underground sometimes not even identified The continuous derogatory behavior made with a smile is an example of this even the derision masked by irony exclusion avoidance isolation from friends and family the so called constructive criticism which instead wants to be purposely destructive the rebuke of the adult like a child are the classic character distortions of these individuals which deeply mark the soul divert the path of life of those who suffer them make the individual object of such behaviors devoid of his dignity often unable to understand what is happening to him and equally frequent is the position of guilt he assumes The mechanism becomes even more perverse those who suffer abuse physical or psychological feel worthy of what they are subjected to a sense of guilt and inadequacy are the consequences such as the fear of not being understood in exposing their own discomfort their own suffering the fear of ridicule shame the fear of not finding solutions to the serious problem Brutality feeds on this Today with this motion for a resolution referring to the Commission 's report it is proposed to pursue through a difficult regulatory path the aim of making the means for fighting these violence more homogeneous and structural However it will be necessary to address this issue in two ways always looking at the medal on both sides so that it does not become an instrument to exploit but is an instrument to respect the human being in a track of lively understanding but also of necessary awareness of how complex and multifaceted this drama is One last thought It is necessary to focus a great deal on teaching those who manifest violent behaviors to admit their limits errors cruelty to teach them to be able to understand that they must be helped because doing themselves justifying themselves saying I do n't do it anymore I did n't do it on purpose or I was misunderstood is profoundly wrong This will be the real challenge to be able to expose the fragility of these men so that they can really where possible undertake a rehabilitation process interrupting the vicious and inhuman circle that feeds violence
Mr President ladies and gentlemen years ago when I became mayor a person who is no longer there but who has been very dear to me he said to me mayor is the one who has the burden and the honor of leading a people whether small or large On these words which I will always remember I began what was an adventure which ended even in a not complete way and left me and still leaves me bitter in my mouth To be mayor as my colleagues have previously explained is to play a very important role often with little resources available with an apparatus of technical offices lacking and with political difficulties too because being mayor having a Junta and a Council does not mean because more small as a role not having political problems In fact many times it means having a context with which to relate more difficult The mayor has the resilience that we are talking about today in the PNRR which is a different resilience because it is a physical and psychological resilience to which he has to act daily for a time that has no border a mayor is not asked to participate in a Commission a Junta or a Council a mayor is available 24 hours a day on Saturday on Sunday in Ferragosto and at Christmas He is a public officer he is a health officer he must declare the state of emergency he must know how to intervene in the most extreme and most difficult conditions A mayor confronts the bureaucracy and perhaps any proposal that comes out of these classrooms should be considered very well when it concerns the mayors because they often find themselves in a position to not apply the rules that we legislate here Why Because they are extremely complicated in their application and in their reading and because the method of extension of the norm is often extremely complicated the large municipalities may have a legal office but the small municipalities which do not have it are perplexed to try to understand what is the most correct interpretation not to incur the mistake Our measures often overlap and are a further inconvenience to these mayors The mayors then have a responsibility they do not have immunity like the parliamentarians in the exercise of their mandate The mayor confronts himself daily with the error that can be there next to him with the error made in good faith with the error made to try to solve a situation in immediacy and then maybe to make the expense in the following years Of course transferring a possible responsibility to an official is a simplistic response because it often results in the cessation of all administrative activity The measure that we are going to adopt today is certainly important but let me say the word it is a niche It concerns the importance of making the second or third term the fact that the municipalities under 5.000 inhabitants may not be forced to do management control although they certainly have other paths to follow and then the question of the difference between the concept of incandidability and that of ineligibility But basically what the mayor needs the one who wants to hold this office in both a small and a large municipality is a reform it has already been widely said by my colleagues of the TUEL provided for by the bill of delegation to the Government which is substantial and fundamental because a good mayor is measured today only in terms of consent and in order to have the consent he must succeed in doing There are dozens of administrators who would like to do this but they have their hands tied to matters of money or standards The mayor seems to have a small role while instead it is the fundamental part of the whole society so many mayors together make the territories the territories make the Provinces and the Regions the Regions make Italy and so many mayors who work well and are put in a position to do the job well can give an immediate response What mayors need is a text that allows them to be truly operational When we get out of here we go to our offices some come back to their homes and some have appointments to attend On the other hand the mayor goes around his own territory he never ends up doing his own business he meets the citizen who asks him why a lamppost is not in place because a road is not fixed and today he is often in a position to answer that the money has not yet arrived that he is waiting for a norm The hope is that this measure although important will be the flywheel and the push because the other great measure the reform of the TUEL will really come to fruition with the assumption that it serves the Italians and that our mayors of whatever political color are are fundamental for the citizens because they carry out their demands in a direct way It is difficult to find who wants to run today it is another political problem but this is not the place to talk about it The other hope is that those who want to apply and want to experience this role which remains and will always remain in the heart of those who do it have the awareness not only of wearing a band but also of honoring it in the true sense of the word We can help them
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I am continuing along the lines of what my colleague and co-rapporteur Senator Ferro has said As already mentioned as regards the forecasts the DEF estimates the debt to GDP ratio to fall in the current year and in the following three years Although in a context of great uncertainty linked to the war in Ukraine and inflationary pressures the growth and interest rate component should contribute to the reduction of the debt to GDP ratio as a result of sustained economic growth and high inflation which would compensate for the rise in interest rates Economic growth should benefit in particular from the impetus from the 2022 budgetary manoeuvre and the implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan In particular the DEF expects a debt to GDP ratio of 147 per cent in 2022 down from 2021 both due to the expected decrease in public sector needs and nominal GDP growth As regards the subsequent years of the forecast horizon a ratio of 145.2 per cent is expected in 2023 mainly due to lower nominal GDP growth compared to stable public sector needs In 2024 the ratio is expected to fall to 143.4 as a result of the reduction in net policy debt to 3.3 of GDP Finally the DEF provides for a debt to GDP ratio of 141.4 in 2025 This path of progressive reduction of the debt to GDP ratio should benefit from the reduction of the Treasury 's liquid stocks which in 2025 will be brought back to a level slightly higher than in 2019 To complete the budget manoeuvre 2023 2025 in the DEF the Government declares related to the budgetary decision a series of draft laws that are adhered to by the document and that colleagues themselves will be able to read Together with the DEF the Government forwarded to Parliament the report setting out the update of the re-entry plan towards the medium term budgetary objective for the necessary parliamentary authorisation The report is adopted pursuant to Article 6 of Law No 243 of 2012 the so called reinforced law implementing the principle of balance of balance sheet which provides for temporary deviations of the balance sheet balance structured by the medium term budgetary objective to be allowed in the event of exceptional events after consulting the European Commission and subject to authorisation approved by the Chambers by an absolute majority of the respective components The presentation of the report is motivated by the fact that on the basis of the new estimates available in 2021 the budgetary balance in structural terms is deteriorated by about one percentage point of GDP compared to 2020 For 2022 an improvement in the structural balance is expected to be lower than the change indicated by NADEF and in the budgetary policy document this results in a different profile particularly in 2022 than the one planned in NADEF and in the budgetary policy document in terms of speed and convergence It is also recalled that for the current year the European Commission has decided to apply the so called general escape clause which ensures a temporary suspension of budgetary rules in order to provide Member States with greater room for manoeuvre in order to bear the health costs necessary to deal with the pandemic and to counter the recessionary effects of the pandemic crisis Finally in the overall analysis of the DEF particular attention must be paid to the issue of increasing the cost of raw materials and more generally building materials with inevitable negative effects on investment and interventions in the construction sector which will inevitably reverberate also on the timing and modalities of implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan as well as on the maintenance of the macroeconomic framework The above issues have also been highlighted in the testimonies made both by the social partners and institutional actors during the round of hearings held jointly by the Senate and Chamber of Deputies budget committees In this respect in line with the considerations of the Court of Auditors it is recalled that tensions on the raw materials markets which have been going on for more than a year have become even more acute with Russia 's invasion of Ukraine Among the various aspects the most important from the point of view of the impacts on the economy is the increase in gas prices on which electricity prices depend High energy prices are reflected as well as directly on consumer prices also indirectly on production costs borne by companies the most energy intensive sectors are experiencing exceptional cost increases At this stage it is not immediate to determine what the magnitude of the increases of the various products under regime will be due to the high uncertainty linked to the outcome of the war This is also an important unknown with respect to the implementation of PNRR policies since the cost of the investment programmes indicated in the plan could also be different from the initial estimates possibly requiring a remodulation of the programme or the allocation of additional resources from the public budget a road the latter which was undertaken by the Government which in the DEF under consideration has anticipated a next measure to adapt the financing to public investment to the extent corresponding to the higher costs of the works With specific consideration to the legislation adopted so far to mitigate the impact of the expensive raw materials on the productive sector while appreciating the interventions put in place so far however cannot be considered the continuing criticality concerning for example the inadequacy of the compensation system the absence of a mechanism of contractual rebalancing with a reservation of balance the failure to recognize the problem of the finding of raw materials or the increase of prices as a cause of force majeure for the termination of the contract Possible solutions to the problems found based on the following proposals should therefore be envisaged for the work being carried out and for those of next confidence an extraordinary update of the prices in use in order to restore the contractual balance to provide for framework agreements already awarded on the basis of unup to date prices an adjustment of the projects before the conclusion of the implementation contracts to consider the possibility of providing for the termination of the contract for excessive onerosity which has occurred to assess the opportunity for certain raw materials related to specific sectors in serious crisis to provide for an extraordinary update of the prices of the materials to be put on the basis of competition in order to take account of the international economic crisis For further information colleagues can refer directly to the public finance documentation prepared by the documentation services of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies
Ferrero L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen in this heat at the end of the parliamentary term we are quickly examining the general government statement for the financial year 2021 and the provisions for the adjustment of the state budget for the financial year 2022 two very important documents that are generally somewhat neglected because they deal with figures public accounts in short boring issues However budget reporting and budgetary adjustment would need a great deal of further study as other colleagues have already pointed out but we can not do so any more today The accounting statement is the accounting document that photographs the performance of the accounts of the year just passed 2021 while the adjustment updates in mid-year the budgetary forecasts formulated under current legislation so we are talking about the development of the first half of 2022 These documents serve to verify the goodness and effectiveness of the measures put in place by the Government and then approved by Parliament In general the accounts are in order in the sense that compared to the forecasts in 2021 we have finally recorded a decrease of the expenditures pairs to approximately 2 but above all greater revenues pairs to approximately 11.7 This is certainly a positive figure for the public accounts but in my opinion a little less for the pockets of the Italians Inevitably after the closure of 2020 with the global blockade of the economy 2021 began with disproportionate increases in the costs of raw materials in February 2021 the price of iron to speak of a material that we all know began to rise dramatically as well as that of plastic and wood it is therefore obvious that a company that no longer returns with the costs eventually increases prices as happened throughout 2021 Price increases in manufacturing and processing may have taken a few months to intervene but inevitably they have arrived and reflected on consumer prices The situation has been worsened by the war which has also led to increases in the prices of energy products which have certainly made more clamour to the public but which have gone to add further to those already in place All this pressure on prices has meant that VAT revenues have increased in particular in fact the higher direct tax revenues are the first cause of the unexpected improvement in revenue Certainly this Government was able to support and help the economy in difficulty for the closures and restrictions that also characterized 2021 Let us not forget how much the League has fought to obtain for example the reductions on excise duties the containment of the effects of the expensive energy for 2022 the cancellation of the system charges measures that only according to the Government even if in a varied government of emergency has been able to obtain It welcomes the fact that the Commission has managed to put in place aid measures without further recourse to debt even the last budgetary deviation from 14.3 billion which technically is not a deviation since we have established in advance in particular the higher tax revenues for more than 10 billion is allowing the Commission to allocate these amounts to the so called Decree Law on Aid bis which will shortly be approved During 2020 deviations of around 200 billion were approved a figure virtually equivalent to the whole PNRR and then allocated to measures that in some cases as is said in the jargon have not done much Many of these billions could then be used for other support measures without further deviations This leads me to a reflection on which I personally always insist Good laws must be made written well and usable by families businesses and citizens in general When too many residues remain in the coffers of the state it means that even what could have been the most beautiful measure in the world risks becoming a pure illusion I take advantage of this explanation of vote to make a final appeal to all of you ladies and gentlemen The citizens and the productive fabric call for serious and concrete tax relief interventions the increase of salaries without the aggraviation of taxes and leaps greater delays in order to be able to pay the debitorial records the cancellation of that tax warehouse inexpensive We are also calling for VAT to be reduced on basic necessities It is necessary to be concrete to get down in reality and to overcome the distances that often exist between the citizen and the legislator All that has been said ladies and gentlemen I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets for the years we have spent together during which we have worked in harmony despite all the differences I also thank the undersecretary Sartore here present who has always been very attentive to all our requests and requests I would like to thank Mr Pesco with whom we have spent these years I have also noted the comments made by the rapporteur Senator Faggi and I therefore conclude by voting in favour of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group
CASELATI L SP PSd Az Mr President on 25 July 2018 I spoke for the first time in this House about the ferocity of a no TAV attack on the Chiomonte shipyard It 's been four years but nothing 's changed In fact today I want to bring to your attention what happened on Saturday in San Didero A thousand protesters started from the camping of the Festival Alta Happiness in the direction of the TAV yard Among these some thirty antagonists gave rise to a guerrilla war with the Forces of Order which caused the injury of 14 agents The premeditation is evident from the clothing of the attackers the weapons used and the strategy The attack had two fronts a handful of protesters crossed the A32 motorway and forced SITAF to close the Turin Bardonecchia at the height of Avigliana in order to prevent the launch of blunt objects against the Forces of order could cause highway accidents All this of course creating a strong discomfort to the road and to the citizens of a valley that would be evoked for tourism which hosted the Olympics of Turin 2006 and which now lives a moment of economic difficulty caused also by these situations The procession at the construction site was in the program of the festival organized as known by antagonists which have little to do with the inhabitants of the Val Susa and which attracts people from all over Europe A tragedy announced despite everything some phenomenon has well thought to advertise the event on the site of the Municipality of Turin Askatasuna has always been the undisputed protagonist of the attacks on the construction site that have occurred over the years and the reports of DIGOS emphasize how the guerrilla techniques used are very similar to those seen in war zones borrowed from other territories of conflict see Kurdistan and adapted to the context of the area Mr President I 'm sorry I 'm just asking you for an extra minute given the buzz PRESIDENT The debate is All right I 'll give you one more minute but try to synthesize why they want to intervene in so many CASELATI L SP PSd Az I summarize President but the situation is serious and the noise is high Explosive orders rockets stones and handicrafts such as the potato shooter defined as a lethal weapon because it can launch long range objects at the speed of a bullet are constantly used against the agents placed on guard of the yard What do you expect to prevent certain situations What do you expect to ban the High Happiness Festival What do you expect to close the social center of Turin Askatasuna a well known den of criminals Run off the dead guy Politics and institutions must distance themselves from these criminals who using the TAV as a fetish want to attack the State and its institutions through unprecedented violence against the Forces of Order Full solidarity and closeness to me and the entire League to the wounded and the operators of the Forces of the Order which we thank for the defense of the legality and the work of the workers Enough with criminals out of history and against modernity that do nothing but damage our territory and the whole country Hard wrist certain penalties and on the side of the Forces of Order always
CASELATI L SP PSd Az Mr President Mr Bonetti ladies and gentlemen since the beginning of the year there have been 21 cases of feminicide which perhaps could have been avoided if action had been taken in time and prevented However the victims are many more because these women were in turn wives mothers daughters and sisters It is precisely from the point of view of prevention that the resolution we are voting on here today is put forward Unfortunately the centres for the recovery of abusive men are too few not online and distributed in a non-homogeneous way on our national territory The data are alarming without psychotherapeutic help violent people tend to carry out aggressive acts more and more serious and with a very high recidivism equal to 85 percent The study of the data collected by the Milan police station from 2018 to 2021 on a case study of 381 people admonished and invited to attend the rehabilitation centers tells us that the relapse after at least an interview in a center is equal to 10 percent poor compared to that equal to 20 percent of those who have never presented themselves to the appointment The causes of violence are known socio-cultural relational psychological and behavioral factors therefore what better method to combat the phenomenon of violence if not an intervention in schools of every order and degree able to teach respect for neighbour animals and the environment around us The teaching of overcoming any type of stereotype genre race or physicality all this certainly does not replace the final vowel with an asterisk but instilling in young minds the axiom that one 's freedom ends when one invades the space and therefore freedom of one 's neighbor or family There are many cases of torturers who in their youth or childhood have been victims of violence direct or assisted Precisely for this reason the approach of the centers with the user does not identify him as suffering from pathology but as incapable of managing the social cultural relational and emotional aspects that he is experiencing helping him to overcome his taboos but at the same time assessing the actual danger all however always aimed at the full protection of the weak subjects who live next to him Important is the accreditation of the centers to ensure that the professionalism expressed is qualified and functional to the effective rehabilitation of the subject The data collected must be put online and as perorated by the report cannot and must not be protected by privacy of course by having the data subject sign a consent form It is news of yesterday that Marco Turinese suffering from pathological narcissism denounced by the family after years of abuse and angeries which had pushed the family even to flee and hide from him after a rehabilitation path at a rehabilitation center he got back on track and even if at a distance of different time he began to have normal relations with his parents and his younger brother There is still no scientific data on the real effectiveness of the recovery pathways of men who are the perpetrators of violence Nevertheless it is evident that the attendance of these centres is certainly always a help and never a damage and it is precisely for this reason that it is important to credit new centres throughout Italy and above all to network the data collected Any new information is certainly useful to analyze and frame the potential danger of an individual if shared with the competent authorities perhaps to prevent a new tragedy In conclusion I would also like to thank the rapporteurs the President all the Commissioners and the Commission 's offices on feminicide for the deepening and great commitment they have made in drafting the report I agree with those who have said before that this resolution signed by all the parliamentary groups is really a good political page today
"Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister we are here because Parliament felt that it was urgent for you to come and report on a further matter from which there is a clear criticism of your work Minister you are well aware that we in the League have never done and we will not give discounts to anyone when it comes to security and public order when the work of the law enforcement forces is in some way called into question The first analysis we need to do to approach the issue in a constructive and unobtrusive way is that what we all saw should not have happened Madam Minister you are called to coordinate the prefectures to organize the management of public order with foresight you are called to assess the risks of situations that can become explosive and to immediately understand how the safety of demonstrators must be protected avoiding violent fringes being able to infiltrate and work from within in order to achieve objectives that have nothing to do with peaceful social claims rightly brought to the streets Let us not allow bad management to be the tool for attacking women and men of the Forces of Order in the accomplishment of their work It is clear that in the management of the event in Turin which had also been authorized as a static garrison things did not work in the right way it was allowed that violent fringes of anarchist insurrectionalism and belonging to the social centers have infiltrated among the students It is obvious that all this has been programmed and organized over time from what emerges from the images these movements were well inserted within the event and had organized in the smallest details the methods of provocation to arrive at the clash The mobile team called to manage the public order of the event immediately understood the danger of what was happening and how it could degenerate if it had not intervened in time to contain the protesters Preventing certain phenomena from happening requires careful guidance and intelligence that needs to be structured and structured well After the well known events of Rome culminated in the violent aggression of the headquarters of the CGIL we would have expected a careful assessment of the risks of the Turin event also because in Turin we have the professionals of the clash antagonists with multiple and multi-annual experiences of attack to the Forces of the order matured mostly in Val Susa but not only Senator Fattori I can't see now anything but provocative agents Askatasuna could not miss the appointment of Piazza Arbarello never miss an opportunity to attack the institutions physically it was a situation too gluttony Of course she showed up with sticks bricks and other blunt objects that they have launched at the appropriate time to trigger the police reaction The guarantee of the security of the citizens and the management of public order are obtained with the daily work means to understand train and train the men and women of the Forces of the Order to equip them with the right means to evaluate which are the most suitable means of defence and above all to monitor and repress the environments where violence against the State nests Since we have assumed the responsibility of Government as a League we have felt the duty to be at the side of the Forces of Order to guarantee them maximum dignity in the performance of their duties we have worked to strengthen their staff and to acquire new endowments that facilitate their tasks such as taser and bodycam Let us not deal with what has happened superficially please ladies and gentlemen You all know how deeply our country has been wounded by ideological clashes by partisan wars by red and black terrorism When one trivializes referring to what happened talking about demonstrations of students one forgets how the dark pages of the political opposition that resulted in terrorism and violence were written just starting from student movements Today marks the anniversary of the death of a young boy Paolo Di Nella it was February 9 1983 the last act of that horrible season of the years of lead when a young student was beaten by violent fringes armed by partisan hatred Let us be careful when we empty the contents of what happened in Turin let us be careful to criminalize the Forces of Order It only takes a little to make a spark turn into a fire We at the League are responsible be it clear If a cop is wrong he has to pay like anyone else The facts will be deepened the images will be reviewed we will have to understand in detail what happened This must be done absolutely quickly Young students and their parents who have found themselves unconsciously in a high risk situation must have answers must be able to know what mistakes and especially by whom they have been committed Minister believe me we are aware of the historical period we are going through We understand how difficult it is to ensure compliance with the rules and how difficult it is to stem violent demonstrations burning under the ashes of the restrictions and suspensions of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms due to the management of the extraordinary and unprecedented event of the pandemic Minister believe me when I tell you that for these reasons security and public order must be a priority for the government We cannot allow events like that which happened on Sunday evening in Milan 's Wall always in Turin where dozens of Senegalese celebrating the victory of the African Cup attacked a patrol car forcing it to escape One of the main problems is precisely the total lack of fear and respect for uniforms and the almost total certainty of impunity for those who care spit or attack the guardians of order Mr. Minister as a League we will be watching over your actions and we will try to direct you to the best of our ability because we are not interested in exploitations at the moment We do not want to capitalize on mistakes an easy political consensus we are in the government because we want to contribute to the good of our country and also to that of those who for 1,600 euros per month endanger their lives every day to ensure the safety of all people"
"Mr President Minister ladies and gentlemen let me say that if the Rules of Procedure allowed this I would have liked to ask the Minister of Justice about the scandalous decision taken yesterday in France regarding the failure to grant extradition of 10 dangerous terrorists communists and murderers However the timing did not allow it and so I return to the question I had put to the Minister of the Interior about the truly incredible number of landings that we are recording every day on our coasts The Minister in recent days has authorized the docking of as many as five different ships for a total of about 1,000 illegal immigrants who have therefore been authorized to land in our ports The data speak for itself at the same date of 2019 the landings were 2,114 immigrants arrived illegally in 2020 this number was 6,614 in 2021 we reached 19,749 and today Minister we are 26,652 These are really impressive numbers which are not even complete because as we know the ghost landings are not recorded which no one is able to quantify exactly These figures alone show that it was extremely wrong to dismantle the so called security decrees which also in 2019 and 2020 had the results that I referred to You wanted to set up a wide mesh system and that is the effect As if that were not enough Minister a few days ago you made statements without perhaps realizing how much they can contribute to the immigration business In order to summarize with a very effective phrase that used Daniele Capezzzone on The Truth a few days ago you developed a theory that the solution would be more immigrants more cooperatives that is exactly the opposite of what you would need I refer Mrs. Minister to your statements at the Confcooperative Assembly PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for the Interior Mr Lamorgese has the right to reply to the question which has just been put for three minutes"
Mr President Madam Minister I am surprised that you are also able to take into account ghost landings because if they are such no one can know how many they are when they happen and to what extent Congratulations though With regard to the theory of relocation Madam Minister we cannot expect to relocate migrants who arrive on our coasts without being real refugees You know better than I that those who really escape from war persecution who really are entitled to refugee status are at most 10 of those who arrive The other 90 percent are economic refugees as is also shown by the demographic composition they are largely young and strong men unlike Ukraine where 90 percent are women and children who really run away from the war Do you understand Madam Minister the difference The solution is not to help landings it is not NGOs that act as sea taxis for boatmen for human trafficking The solution is to block departures less departures means fewer deaths That 's a statistic Madam Minister The only way to block departures is to ensure that in agreement with the States of origin there is what we call in naval blockade jargon even if it is not really a naval blockade because we do not propose an act of war but an act of peace in agreement with the countries of origin so that asylum applications are made in these countries and at the diplomatic representations of the countries of origin or transit can be submitted applications and screened This is a screening that we should do in any form of relocation however we can get the green light from Europe It is very questionable that European countries accept immigrants who are not entitled to remain on our territory Therefore Madam Minister the solution that Brothers of Italy proposes which I hope the Government will eventually adopt is to ensure that these boats of despair do not leave That is the real objective we must aim for
Mr President today we are all committed to reaffirming the commitment of the Senate and Parliament to combat violence against women an alarming phenomenon which despite the constant commitment of the institutions cannot be eradicated and unfortunately seems to be on the increase Nothing is more hateful than violence against women and I would add even against children who are sometimes victims of the violence they are witnessing Brothers of Italy shares the conclusions of the report under discussion with particular regard to the need to regulate on the basis of homogeneous standards to coordinate and above all to strengthen the centres for the treatment of men who are the perpetrators of violence centres which have so far been established in a spontaneous and leopard spotted manner on national territory The action of these centres is fundamental both for the prevention itself when the violence is still in the potential state but the so called spy behaviors that announce it are already manifested and to intervene when the violence is in place in order to prevent further degrees of escalation of violent acts and above all the cases of recurrence which as is well known and many colleagues have already mentioned are also very often the most serious episodes The available statistics show that the relapse in crimes against women is very high we are talking about 85 But we also know thanks to the many studies mentioned in the report that proper treatment especially if carried out on as voluntary a basis as possible can lead to the reduction of relapse by up to half i.e. up to 50 For this reason it is important that the treatment is also ensured during the execution of the sentence as required by the reform of the prison order approved under the so called red code But it is even more important that this treatment is not interrupted at the time of release as unfortunately happens too often It should therefore be stressed that the report rightly points out that it is precisely at the time of the return to freedom that the greater the risk to the victim is It is important to remember as the report does the good practice of the Milan court which has activated the sending of perpetrators of violence to specific territorial recovery programmes Another fundamental instrument also introduced with the code red is the new discipline of article 165 of the penal code which subordinates the granting of the conditional suspension of the sentence in cases of conviction for crimes of sexual violence stalking domestic violence and so on to the participation of the guilty person in specific recovery paths more reason in our opinion to enhance the centers that are responsible for this objective Many others would be the ideas for reflection offered by the report on which there is no time to dwell I would just like to stress that most of the Brothers of Italy agree with them and for this reason too we shall be voting in favour of the resolution which refers to the report However ladies and gentlemen in conclusion I should like to express some concerns about the apodittic statement that I quote on page 43 of the report it is precisely the patriarchal model within which individual acts of violence against women develop Attributing to the patriarchal model which in Italy no longer exists for decades the main or even exclusive cause of violence against women seems to me to be too reductive and risks underestimating if not ignoring other triggering factors much more current and insidious that originate more from the loss of every model of value reference induced by nihilism and relativism of this modernity than from a patriarchal culture now disappeared and outdated or worse still means focusing all the attention on the patriarchal model as if it were a scapegoat and ignoring the negative influence of traditions and religious beliefs outside Europe that assign to women a role yes anthropologically I would say almost biologically inferior and that produce these yes sexism and masculism as a necessary result It will mean something colleagues for example if 42 of the sexual violence in Italy is committed by foreigners who as is well known are only 10 of the population especially of North African origin or if 33 of the abuse in the family or even 71 percent of the crimes of induction and exploitation of prostitution are once again committed by foreigners Perhaps an additional reflection by the Commission on these figures would have been helpful in my opinion and in our opinion I conclude with a final critical remark in the report we read on page 24 that among the factors that would facilitate violent behavior there would be I quote the static and rigid vision of male and female gender identities I believe that this statement is not only unfounded but also misleading and the result of an ideological forcing which in this report is frankly untrue Respect for and enhancement of the male and female identity are in our opinion the most solid prerequisite on which the mutual acceptance of the natural differences between the two sexes is built to be understood as an opportunity for mutual enrichment through complementarity obviously on the basis of the absolute equality of rights and duties On the contrary it is from the claim of ignoring differences and making everything fluid homogeneous neutral and homologable which opens the way to the lack of respect for the other and to all forms of violence In any case even in the presence of these questionable elements which are fortunately marginal we agree entirely with the report and therefore we will vote in favour of it
Madam President Madam Minister as you know very well the prison police are working in very extreme conditions Among other things today some prison police unions have called for a demonstration under the Ministry of Justice for next Wednesday April 13 to ask for measures against them Unfortunately as you know the prison police are subject to continuous assaults which no longer count and the decision to close judicial psychiatric hospitals OPG and to transfer prisoners with psychiatric problems to ordinary departments because the residences for the execution of security measures REMS are all beyond to come has aggravated the situation further Moreover the system of open cells with the so called dynamic supervision has unfortunately handed over to organised crime the control of many prisons because the staff available to supervise is insufficient in the face of prisoners who can move freely inside the prison all day long There are shortages of staff but above all the average age is increasingly advanced so many prison police officers struggle to cope with these very heavy tasks As you know Minister doctors in prisons are no longer there because health care has been transferred to ASL Many prison police officers no longer know what to do because now systematically the prisoners denounce them for torture because we have a case of torture so elastic wide and undifferentiated so it can be in everything even psychological suffering let alone in prison In such a situation you have appointed the new head of the department of the penitentiary administration DAP raising the protests of the unions but also even within the Supreme Council of the judiciary CSM because undoubtedly the profile of the new head of the DAP is more suitable for the guarantor of the prisoners than the head of the penitentiary police It is a divisive appointment unfortunately I have already mentioned this and you have answered me by inviting me to evaluate it on the ground but Minister such an appointment should be made with an ex ante judgment and not by referring to an ex post evaluation Therefore from this point of view I would ask you to know on the basis of which criteria you have made this appointment PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Justice Professor Cartabia has the right to reply to the question which has just been put for three minutes
I can't say I 'm satisfied Minister I 'm sorry The reference to the opportunity to appoint the head of the DAP within the prison police force was obviously a reference de iure condensing I was interested in your opinion you did n't give it to me but I guess I take note of the appointment of Dr. Renoldi but I have never questioned the professional qualities and the curriculum However he certainly was not the only one to have these qualities Dr. Renoldi's choice as you know has provoked opposition within the MSC itself Dr Di Matteo said he was opposed to this appointment because Dr Renoldi I quote delegitized with contemptuous words people and institutions that deserved respect referring as you know to the criticisms directed by Dr Renoldi to the militant anti-mafia perched according to Dr Renoldi in the cult of martyrs Dr. Renoldi expressed opposition to Articles 41 a concerning the hard prison regime for mobsters and 4 a of the Law on penitentiary law He defined the principle of certainty of punishment as old talk show payouts and the result of obtuse justiceism in parentheses Dr. Salvatore Borsellino replied to the press that Renoldi at the DAP was the last promissory note of the State Mafia negotiation Well Madam Minister Caesar 's wife must not only be honest she must also appear above suspicion In this case I think that with this appointment you made an unnecessary divisive choice
Mr President the adoption of the report on the treatment paths for men who are perpetrators of violence in affective and gender based relations bears witness to the sense of responsibility of the members of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into Femicide and the great work that has been done by fellow Commissioners of all parties in order to arrive at a shared document that goes beyond ideological fences It is a report which analyses a serious and important issue which unfortunately involves a great many women and which is very often linked to cultural roots which deserve a more in depth analysis The work done by the Commission of which I am proud to be a member seeks to provide answers to certain aspects of the problem Violence against women is a widespread and structural social phenomenon with deep cultural roots which still permeate the relations between men and women all over the world although in some countries the phenomenon is much more serious than others for cultural and even religious regiments Unfortunately this phenomenon is also present in our country albeit to a lesser extent than in other European countries as far as feminicide is concerned If the mere statistical data tells us that the other European countries and the rest of the world excluding Oceania record percentage numbers on the feminicide superior to the Italian ones when we get out of the statistics the situation changes because the 99 victims of feminicide of 2019 have names and faces have stories that no arid statistical report can tell and even a single woman victim of feminicide is unacceptable and represents an immeasurable defeat for society because violence against women is a phenomenon that has a public dimension not exclusively private as is often lived by the victims and the authors of violence is determined and fed by the imbalance in the relations of power between women and men and for this interrogation and requires a decisive and timely response from politics I would remind you that a strong response has been and has been strongly desired by the League 's Parliamentary Group I refer to the introduction of Law No 69 of 19 July 2019 known as the Red Code It is a law for which we fought and which represents a conquest for women who are victims of violence because it does not merely tighten the sanctions but provides for the first time in Italy an obligation to transmit immediately the news of the crime to the public prosecutor in oral form followed by the written one with an acceleration of the possible adoption of measures for the protection of victims The time factor is in fact fundamental the speed of intervention can depend on the physical integrity of the woman or even her life Turning to the genesis of this report I can only welcome some of my comments and I thank the President the Members of the Commission and the rapporteurs for taking them into account and of course for all the work they have done I am pleased that a substantial part of the report has been removed from the report covering issues that should not be discussed at school because these are aspects that are completely unrelated to the context of the report itself and because the education of children is the responsibility of parents The report also deleted the paragraph expressing concerns and concerns regarding Article 6 of the Code Red Law The provision in question provides that with regard to offences of domestic and gender violence the conditional suspension of the sentence is however subject to participation in specific recovery routes in bodies or associations dealing with the prevention psychological assistance and recovery of persons sentenced for the same crimes and that the costs arising from participation in the recovery courses are borne by the sentenced person With regard to this rule there had been some criticalness determined by the possibility that the deed was without economic means This observation has been accepted in the final document and therefore those charges are borne by the sentenced person as it is right that it should be The protection and priority concern must be addressed to the victims of crime and our aim is to adopt laws that are on the side of the victims As a League we are always on the side of the victims not forgetting the perpetrators of the crimes their risk of relapse and the reeducational function of the sentence In fact all this must be accompanied by the certainty of the penalty I can say that in Italy there is violence against imported women which comes from cultural roots outside our own and we only hear about them when they come to take care of the media that is when it is too late It is undeniable that religious factors and millennial cultural traditions are the greatest obstacles to the removal of gender violence We must intervene on these situations in which women are really considered culturally as an inferior being and of which all too often we avoid talking as if it were a taboo Pretending not to see might be politically correct but it is not a solution We give voice to women to all women to invisible women who also live semi-secreted at home who go out only if accompanied and suffer forms of creeping violence including the least visible is the impossibility to choose and decide independently of one 's own life
Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government it is in the role of food policy and building new cultural models The report on the treatment paths for men who are the perpetrators of violence that we are about to vote on today places us in front of a rather delicate topic which must be addressed with the intention of being able to act on the behaviour of each one and being able to provoke a change necessary to build the cultural changes place that in the end the goal is precisely to change the culture of the entire country Male violence against women is a widespread social distress with deep cultural roots a phenomenon of a public dimension which at last in recent years is treated with transparency but which has been silenced for too long just as the victims have been It has already been said that one Istat study confirms that more than three out of ten women aged between sixteen and seventy years have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence throughout their lives In 2021 the victims of feminicide were one every three days These are figures that make us shudder if we think about the country we want to be and the emancipation that we believe we have Unfortunately even today the reluctance with which men's violence against women is punished is perceptible While it is true that the ius corrigendi exercised in the family by the husband towards his wife has come out of Italian jurisprudence we can still feel its cultural influence because unfortunately this imbalance of power between women and men has been part of our way of life for too long The role that man and woman play in society is not defined at birth as each society establishes the rules by which a man and a woman should behave The problem must therefore be tackled with intense and convincing cultural action with the help of the operators involved and their specific competences with the objective of the definitive eradication of this behaviour The pain of the victims will in fact be elaborated over time and the internal suffering will remain forever For this reason a decisive and timely response to the Government is required Data show that men who exercise violence against women tend to become increasingly aggressive and in the absence of intervention relapse into 85 of cases In order to carry out the interruption of violent behavior the centres concerned with re-education aim first of all to make men understand what are the violence and the indelible pain caused to the victims and to develop in them the skills necessary to recognize and manage those lives that generate anger and violence in order to avoid relapse and escalation It is therefore essential to focus on the treatment of men who are perpetrators of violence with targets to stop the escalation of violence already in the first spy behavior to sanction in accordance with the constitutional principle of reeducation of the condemned to reduce the high rate of recurrence among the perpetrators of violent behavior The Istanbul Convention which aims to eliminate all forms of gender based violence promotes the treatment of men who are the perpetrators of violence with a view to preventing new violence and changing violent behaviour and identifies the creation of re-education pathways as one of the key interventions of the strategy to combat domestic and gender based violence Today in Italy men who are the perpetrators of violence face different destinies depending on the geographical location of their residence In fact there are few specialised centres to which they can turn not widely distributed on the territory without accreditation and public funding that in order to exist must offer paid services The centres should instead be spread everywhere on the territory with uniform standards and be financed in such a way that they can offer services up to the goal to the perpetrators of violence and their families who voluntarily turn to them to the Quaestors and to the magistrates who send them to the centers and also to the prison structures Among the dedicated centres I would like to focus on the Italian Centre for the Promotion of Mediation CIPM that was born in Milan in 1995 and since 2018 exists also in Cagliari the Italian Centre for the Promotion of Mediation and Reparative Justice CIPM Sardinia formed by various professionalism The CIPM and the CIPM Sardegna in 2021 carried out a project together Interventions aimed at the perpetrators of gender violence and in affective relations In this regard there is also an operating toll free number H24 throughout the region but that is not enough The centres in Italy are very few The resources must be allocated with accreditation it is necessary to create proximity centres so that man at the first signs of discomfort can go to the nearest centre In conclusion Mr President it would be desirable for all the relevant legislation to be rapidly approved and to be included in a specific title of a single text dedicated to the fight against gender violence and the promotion of a society free from violence against women
Mr President I would like to make a few points starting with this morning 's debate on gender Even on this request which came in these days from the Government we could talk about a technical language in the sense that for days it was said by some political forces that there was a need to provide for a deviation that could put resources in the field to help families and businesses but we were told that the deviation cannot be done because we cannot do new debt Today however the request comes from the Government and we are supporting after hearing the European Commission that the Government itself requires permission to resort to debt On the one hand they tell us we do n't have to do another debt and then the government makes a request for debt clearance It is obvious I see Senator Misses that he shakes his head that we are not doing new debt that is absolutely clear but we are not even improving compared to the higher revenues and compared to what the law provides so it does n't really change much We can play with words say that it is not a deviation but a request for authorisation of debt so it also serves the absolute majority as prescribed by the Constitution but the substance is that The higher revenues should be used to reduce public debt because there is a rule Article 17 1 a of Law 196 of 2009 which says that the higher revenues cannot be used for new interventions but in fact to improve public finance In order to be able to derogate from this law let us not reduce public debt because we rightly use these resources which should in fact reduce public debt to give aid to the population as we have always said You can use the technical language you prefer but in essence it's what we 've been saying for months and we 've been told it could n't be done In view of the narratives that these days are heard in the debates on television it is interesting to underline the fact that these 14 billion that will be available to help our citizens are not children of who knows which policies of the government or of who knows what miracle but they are children of a very simple factor with inflation and the increase of the costs of raw materials and energy substantially the State introduced more VAT there are no great miracles that is the reason And these resources must rightly be used in aid We would have expected this is a bit sorry the debate is quick and quick and we do not want to waste time on the government or the country and we would have liked a more substantive discussion on how these resources will be allocated In fact today we are faced with a delegation in white in the sense that we delegate in white to the Government which will decide essentially how to employ them We will also have little room for intervention because now that the decree is published and sent to the Senate in fact there are the month of August and then the election campaign and therefore very little can be done We would have liked to have done more We take advantage of the intervention to underline to the member of the government that since these greater resources derive substantially with inflation from an increase in VAT revenues it would be very important to use them this is the proposal that the League made to zero VAT on basic necessities This would mean meeting the people who are in difficulty and the people who need them the most
Mr President I am satisfied with the Minister 's reply because he has clearly focused the problem he has explained to us what the problems are and he has also proposed possible solutions It is clear that health surveillance as he acknowledged cannot be the solution at least because not all workers can be used as smart working therefore there are categories that in case of necessity have the need to take advantage of the absence from the service The measure has a cost which we estimated in about 70 million for the three months but could also be higher It 's a problem but it can't be the problem In these two years we have found resources for everyone rightly and dutylessly from restaurateurs to ski resorts we have spent billions and you members of the government know this better than we parliamentarians It is absurd not to be able to find 70 million even 80 90 or 100 for the most fragile and weak people I invite you during the conversion of the decree law reopening that is under consideration by the House to accept the amendment that restores the protections of Article 26 and not those of the list of superragiles that as you know is not enough because it excludes too many people The invitation I make to you and your colleagues is to prove that you are a civilized country worrying first of all of the weakest
"Mr President Minister I will be very detailed in my speech and I will deal with a small part of your report which I have listened to and which has asked me to speak This part concerns the condition of our penitentiaries and all the considerations that you have expressed in this regard with respect to this macro- problem which we carry behind us from several managements of your Dicastery and not from today of course Minister I appeal to the sensitivity that I have been able to perceive in listening to your report to the great sensitivity that you have shown on this and on all the issues you have dealt with during the illustration because I am aware that we are starting from a somewhat different point of view and paradigms I 've always had great attention to the condition of our penitentiaries I have constantly visited them starting with those of my region as a regional councillor and I can assure you Minister that by simplifying a lot the daily living conditions on the prison planet are directly proportional to the working conditions of prison police officers this is for a simple and simple observation namely that there is a cause effect relationship between the well being and serenity of the prison police officer as far as possible carrying out difficult work and his behaviour always within the framework of legislation and law towards the prisoners It is trivial as I am telling you but I want to highlight it because in your speech I did not perceive this sensitivity I did not warn you so I feel obliged to express this consideration The servants of the State divided into bodies are all as far as I am concerned our daily heroes but if we wanted to draw up a ranking of those who are subjected to more difficult and complicated working conditions I have no doubt that the prison police officers are really those most put in trouble Firstly objectively for the type of work they have to do they are also imprisoned for a compensation that sometimes does not reach 1,500 euros per month obviously in an absolutely blameless way Moreover they are often put in difficulty by the rules to which we submit them and above all by the chronic guilty incomprehensible sub-organic to which they are subject What up to a few years ago they did in four or five today only one agent does Minister it is enough to access some penitentiary and not enough the example of the penitentiary of Florence I tell you that almost all penitentiaries except for a few very rare exceptions are in the same condition to perceive this great great problem Minister I appeal to your sensitivity The body of the prison police officers refers to his Dicastery evidently therefore I urge as far as possible greater attention to the daily living conditions of the agents more and more moreover victims of episodes of aggression by the prisoners"
"Mr President Minister ladies and gentlemen first of all let me say that of course Brothers of Italy clings around the family of Lorenzo because we are all parents and we understand the pain the drama Losing a child during school hours losing a child in the school work program requires each of us to examine our consciences These parents are in pain and for them there will never be an end of pain because the penalty will continue to accompany day after day the life of this family Mr Lamorgese it is clear that you have difficulty managing public order I listened carefully to your information written by your offices where there is first the description of the events But she forgot to say the most important thing you Minister were not able to divide the students those who were in the streets to manifest for a just cause such as the death of their friend their student social centers provocative infiltrated You see Minister your job should be to prevent and to ensure that students are not paying in these squares because those bloody faces fall into your work Minister Putting the Forces of Order at the mercy of all and of no one is your responsibility because you are at the top of that Ministry is the ultimate link in the chain of command It is useless that today in addition to his inability and his immobility let us feel that at the end of the day a scapegoat will find him But you will not have to find him in the Forces of Order which we defend and will always defend for their work The law enforcement is your responsibility Minister and it is your responsibility Even this time the demonstrations escaped from her hands because she could not prevent That there are social centers that there are provocateurs in every manifestation is now evident we have seen it in demonstrations against the green pass where there were families with strollers but there were also social centers and infiltrated And what 's your answer She always makes the whole grass a bundle this is no longer possible Minister if we were in other states France the United Kingdom Austria Romania too you would no longer be sitting in that chair today you would have been sent home because too many circumstances have seen you unable to play your role I would just like to remind you of the disaster you caused when on the occasion of the attack on the CGIL you failed to stop a gentleman Giuliano Castellino who was a special guard with a residence obligation and a prohibition to participate in the demonstrations Consider moreover that the same gentleman it is said from Piazza del Popolo an hour and seventeen minutes before said let 's all go to CGIL to take what is ours She said she could n't do anything because if she stopped him something worse would happen The worst could not be however because you Minister have reached the worst of the work of your Ministry I would like to remind you of the rave party that took place in August in Viterbo with 10,000 stoners coming from all over Europe She was the only one who did n't realize it and let them occupy 30 hectares for days leaving a dead person on the ground dozens of hospitalized for overdose rape And yet she was n't even able to kick them out They 're gone I would also like to remind you that since you played this important role our borders have become a colob In your mandate you were unable to defend the borders of Italy but only the borders of Europe The landings have increased and we have reached over 60,000 compared to 10,000 two years ago You ask yourself a few questions or can you just read what your offices are asking you to come to Parliament and say things that will remain in the history of this nation as when in this House to the precise question about what that bourgeois agent did when he was pushing that truck always during the attack on the CGIL you replied that you were verifying the wavy force exerted in the middle How long will we have to hear these answers in a House of Institutions Do you really think we 're blind and deaf Do you really think that if ministers in other countries had your behavior today they would still be sitting in that chair Mr. Minister I tell you with ease and politeness that in life it takes courage and you have an opportunity to show that you have to resign"
"Mr President Minister we are faced with a dramatic figure 400,000 new born but for 2021 we will be under this quota We are faced with a birth emergency that has never had such dramatic peaks In the face of this emergency I tell you very sincerely Minister we are convinced that the measure we are examining is a warm cloth or a little more We must have the courage to make real family policies and these are not We insist that family policies are policies to combat poverty but that is not the case Family policy is one thing the policy of combating poverty is another We cannot continue with the destruction of the family from an ideological point of view every day with legal measures and stratifications on the one hand and then on the other thinking that the family demolished from an ideological point of view can continue to play its role from a social point of view It does n't work that way once the family is destroyed and demolished it is forever and you can't think that the birth rate is filled with other resources The birth rate is filled with the family and nothing different My thoughts today go to the 20 million Italian families to the 20 million dads and moms who woke up this morning accompanied their children to school went to work prepared breakfast for them lunch for when they return I think about the everyday life of this work that is very often left without resources help and support The first major drawback of this measure is that we have once again wanted to link the policies that are said to be familiar but in reality they are social to the question of the ISEE we cannot link family policies to the ISEE because this is a tool for measuring wealth and it is fine if we want to use it for policies to fight poverty so that families people who must be helped out of poverty have a reliable measurer But at a time when we want to make family policies we have to get out of this kind of ISEE loop because the ISEE is not primarily made for family policies Excuse me we give indiscriminately the bonus facades we have the money for the bonus earthquake as is right that it is without considering the ISEE and in the face of an emergency such as that of the birthday we link the policies of support for birth to the ISEE You know this is crazy We have the money to give the bonus facades to all Italians and instead we limit the policies of support to the birth with the tool of the ISEE This is in itself the first of the great problems The second of the great problems is that the ISEE moreover is an unfair instrument that misjudges wealth It is an instrument that for example measures gross wealth But how do you calculate the ISEE on the basis of gross income So we force Italians who already pay taxes to pay them twice because they also find their wealth indicator based not on net income as it would be right but on gross income as it happens today Again we have repeatedly pointed out the need to remove the family home from the basket of the ISEE because it does not produce any income for the family that lives in it The family home is the minimum union that we have to recognize to the family in order to be able to raise their children in order to do what the Constitution requires to do Let us not forget that maintaining educating and educating children is not a habit that Italian families have but it is a duty that the Constitution imposes on them We cannot therefore tax that part of the income that families use for their constitutionally established duty precisely which is to maintain educate and educate the offspring Minister we must make a decisive change of pace We have to decide whether we really want to invest in this country and the family or whether we want to keep telling each other about it We can tell it for the next centuries but the result unfortunately Istat tells us will invariably be the same and that is a painful demographic decline of our country that from the present about 60 million inhabitants will soon reach 30 35 million inhabitants without considering the effects of denatality on the social balance Currently the generation that is holding the weight of the elderly and people who are no longer self sufficient because of the age is still a large slice because they are the so called baby boomers born between the fifties and sixties But when baby boomers retire underneath there will be no one paying those pensions instead of a demographic pyramid we will have a demographic fungus in which the part of the active population will be so small that it will no longer be able to bear the burden This is not about making ideological policies but simply about having common sense about investing in the future of our country about the most important good that we have that is our families Families Minister are mother and father with children it is not difficult It 's been like this forever since there 's the world Let us forget the ideologies and invest in the true primary good of our country the natural family the one that our Constitution contemplates At this point I would like to thank Mr Bonetti for listening to Parliament and all the political forces who unanimously called for the opening of a table for the reform of the ISEE It is certainly a very important step and I am very pleased with that because it is a result of all the political forces in Parliament But we must go beyond the reform of the ISEE we must have the courage to say that the ISEE cannot be applied to family policies We must have the courage to say that in addition to parental leave in addition to kindergartens they are for goodness sake a commendable policy contained in this provision we must finally arrive at a family friendly tax Let 's call it flat tax let 's call it family factor let 's call it whatever you want the concept is very simple everything the family earns and spends to raise children cannot be taxed cannot be touched by tax It 's very simple Minister This is what we have to get to the rest for goodness sake are interesting ideas they are proposals animated by the best interest but they will not solve the problem All this to say that this is a measure on which we will certainly as will be said later in the debate and in the explanation of vote will not fail to support us However we ask you for courageous policies and a courageous change of pace We can no longer hear ourselves say in this Parliament that there is no money If there 's no money for our kids then there 's no money for anything else You tell me what it 's like to build motorways what 's the point of building railways what 's the point of investing in who knows what infrastructure if those infrastructures are n't used by anyone why are n't our children using them anymore Might as well reverse the trend We might as well finally have the courage to say that today who brings a child into the world is a hero and the State must put itself at the side of that hero support him and help him with all the resources available"
Minister it was a pleasure to hear your report in this House In this year a good job has been done and however a big piece of road still remains to be done Minister you opened your report with a letter you wanted to read to this House it was important we appreciated it so as never to forget that justice is a very deep cord in the heart of every human being and we are called to that desire for justice each in his role and in his task to give satisfaction You have noted the need to intervene urgently in the face of the latest disturbing facts of judicial reporting which have undermined confidence in the judiciary He spoke in his report of the need to re-separate citizens confidence in the judiciary I could not agree more A reform of the Supreme Council of the judiciary is needed and we need to intervene on each of those issues that the political force I represent today has presented to the public as referenda the appeal of the PM the responsibility of the magistrates the separation of careers and the reform of the MSM Quis custodiet custodias Today it is more essential than ever that this question be asked and it is equally essential to find an answer I do not want to forget what you said about the need to intervene on prison facilities on support for men and women in the prison police I would also like to mention Minister the need to review and do so as soon as possible certain aspects of emergency legislation which restrict in some cases even severely the right to defence and to conflict I believe that we can now decide to go beyond those limits There are aspects which you have particularly enucleated concerning the reform of the family process We worked together on the reform of the family process and I believe that the work that came out of it is good interesting and with good prospects You have rightly started this issue by talking about feminicide but let me tell you Minister that feminicide is not family law but criminal law it is another thing She read a letter I would like to read more in my turn starting with that of Luigi a father of Naples who writes to me Good morning Senator I 've been facing a ten year battle against false stalking and ill treatment charges I 've been tried two times I 've both been acquitted The court had arranged a common trust but the Court of Appeal imposed exclusive custody despite having passed two technical advice for the evaluation of my parental ability If you can help me I 'd appreciate it A broken dad 23 June 2021 is replaced by the following Then there is that of Stephen a father of Nuoro who writes to me Forgive me if I address you but I have not seen my son for almost a year Is it possible that a mother with a four year old son disappears from the face of the Earth The child was taken to Belarus by his mother and although the local court ordered the return under the Hague Convention the mother opposes and nobody does anything Please help me Francesco a father of Prato writes to me Good morning Senator I 'd like to talk to you I 'm a separate dad I got a punitive sentence I just want to see my son more often but now I can only see him one day a week I 'd like to pay the right money to keep it and not a crazy maintenance I 'm gonna have to sleep in the car cause I can't have a house for rent anymore Please call me Then there is Anna a grandmother of Milan Good morning Senator I 'm a grandmother who does n't see her granddaughter she lives 500 meters from my house for months now and even my son can't be with her three year old despite the court order After months and months of unnecessary trials the money is over and my son is desperate and distrusted he no longer knows what to do and I am very worried Please Senator help us These are stories of life lived they are facts we in the face of these facts have tried with the reform of the civil process to give some response but until we intervene with a trust really shared and with a training of magistrates lawyers and other operators who are really respectful of the shared trust we will not get out of this cul de-sac Mr. Minister it is appropriate to avoid in the process of family logic of opposition between mom and dad between husband and wife it is not to be nourished the intrafamily conflict but promoted a logic of alliance not of demonization of the other otherwise it will always be the children to pay for it You said words that I feel like sharing and signing as well as with the pen even with the heart He said that justice does not feed on hatred but seeks the truth and the care of relationships Justice must be able to unite rather than divide this is all the more true in the family process which is still controversial today and cannot be a child of ideologies Please Minister I repeat feminicide is criminal law it is another thing the civil process and the family process must not be the result of mutual demonisation There are other issues Minister which concern us because they always impact on the weakest the most fragile and our children What happens in an abuse of the family process also happens in other areas We have already spoken with the letter that I read before of the international abduction of minors a plague that unfortunately does not mention stopping in Italy It is necessary to intervene and support these parents who are not always dangerous and paternalistic males or worse still patriarchal but very often they are mothers who have suffered the subtraction of their child often brought by fathers in Islamic countries We must intervene and possibly even with legal aid support the immense legal costs that must be incurred abroad Faced with all this international framework we have noted with concern the advance of a creative jurisprudence which despite the clear and precise arrests of the Supreme Court of Cassation in united sections and of the Constitutional Court with the judgment n. 33 of 2021 pushes for the indirect legitimacy of a barbaric practice unacceptable unworthy of a civilized country and contrary to any form of dignity of women I 'm talking about the uterus for rent We cannot legitimize either ex ante or worse still ex post a practice that exposes the woman to be considered less than a living incubator We cannot allow children to be bought on the Internet to be selected from the catalog according to the physical characteristics of their parent and then bought and brought to Italy underground legitimizing all later with the beautiful sentence of a court complacent We need Minister an international moratorium on the uterus for rent We need the uterus for rent to be recognised by our country as a universal offense It 's not like that today Today the conduct of those who resort to the practice of the uterus rented abroad is not punished because it does not fall among the criminal offences if committed abroad There are many other issues I would like to address A bill already passed in the Senate is being examined in the House to prevent self harm and turn self harm into a crime Today this is not the case our children and our children who are also complicit in distance learning DAD and the use of computers and devices are now exposed to attacks ranging from incitement to child pornography to incitement to self harm in short to absolute dangers for their safety We must also intervene on this We can not remain silent I conclude Minister by urging you to move forward as I said much has been done but much still needs to be done with its management however we trust that we can really improve things for the future of our children our young people and our country
"Minister starting in 2018 the Minister for the Interior Matteo Salvini had given impetus to the experimentation for the use by law enforcement of electric impulse guns the so called tasers considering them an important support for those who work every day to guarantee security and public order With great satisfaction the commitment has been maintained and the police have been equipped with electrical devices almost 5,000 tasers have been distributed throughout the national territory Unfortunately however prison police officers have not been included in the supply who suffer daily assaults from inmates inside prison facilities Already with a previous act of inspection union at the first signature of Senator Stefani the parliamentarians of the Lega Salvini Group Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione have exposed the discomfort denounced by the prison police unions regarding the aggressions suffered by the agents in the performance of their work and by the prisoners for good It is only thanks to the high professionalism and the high sense of duty if the prison agents manage to bring the order back inside the prison structures and avoid worse consequences to people or things Prison police officers are too often victims of aggression and it is essential for their safety that they be guaranteed appropriate safeguards and instruments To date prison police officers are not expecting the Taser 's budget but it would be important to re-evaluate this decision It is therefore asked to know whether the Minister in address does not consider it appropriate to equip prison police personnel with suitable tools to defend themselves from internal aggressions to prison structures and to defend other prisoners such as electric bollards even if only and exclusively in cases where they are forced to face attacks on the person Let me add that often visiting prisons we are faced with complaints from prison police officers who claim that they simply have their hands to deal with possible aggressions The alternative is between the use of your hands and the use of lethal force consisting of the firearms supplied Perhaps an intermediate instrument which safeguards the life of the attacker in addition to that of the attackers could be useful for this purpose PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for Justice Professor Cartabia has the right to reply to the question which has just been put for three minutes"
Minister we are pleased with your answer since we feel that your will is in the sense of starting or evaluating to start an experiment as a department weapon of course with all the limitations and security that it is necessary to guarantee precisely so that it does not become a dangerous instrument that is then turned against those who are there to protect public order We also learn with great satisfaction of the beginning of the spread of the so called bodycams which are a valuable tool for our law enforcement forces to ensure security to them and also to prisoners who are often attacked by other prisoners Thank you and I wish you well PRESIDENT The debate is The question time questions on the agenda are thus exhausted
Mr President Madam Minister as we unfortunately know in Milan on New Year 's Eve at least nine young women were victims of sexual harassment and violence As we can see on the numerous videos circulating on the net and as reported by the media 18 young people 15 years old and three minors between fifteen and twenty one years old both foreign and second generation Italians of North African origin have been identified because they are considered involved in sexual assaults According to the investigators findings there would be at least three different episodes of violence that were always consumed in Milan in Piazza Duomo on New Year 's Eve These three episodes involve this group of young and very young people who seem to act in packs but above all in an organized way These images of course immediately reminded us of what happened during the 2016 New Year 's Eve in Cologne and in other German cities where hundreds of foreigners and German citizens of North African origin relented against women intent on celebrating New Year 's Eve causing real organized guerrilla actions aimed at sexual assaults We know of course that violence against women is a problem that affects all societies but attention must be paid to the pervasiveness of certain cultures that have radicalized over time a vision of women who are highly discriminatory placed in a condition of subalternity and in stark contrast to the principles of our Constitution which are based on the democratic culture that has belonged to the West for millennia It is worrying that in some Arab countries in the North African region the collective harassment of a woman is a practice that has had an exponential increase in the last twenty years following the path of religious radicalization There are areas and neighborhoods without any form of control especially in European states where there is a higher rate of immigration This may lead to the risk of an increase in phenomena such as those described and highlights the inability to predict stable integration processes It is worrying about the non-management of the phenomenon especially in the highly migratory Member States and there is a great difficulty in combating the proliferation of these groups of very young people who do not recognize the value systems of our European countries The Minister is therefore asked what measures he intends to take to counter the proliferation of phenomena of this nature
Mr Minister I am pleased with your words but of course I will be able to say that I am satisfied when I see the facts that there will be a radical change in the management of migration If it is true that there is the big problem of redistribution we know that we we have to think about our country everyone will think about his can act really doing what he just said about limited numbers because the greater the mass arrivals the more difficult it will be to manage integration I also say this as mayor of a small municipality where immigrants are not considered foreigners but have a name a surname a face but we cannot continue to leave all the weight of integration on schools especially at this time when young people already have so many problems due to the pandemic the DAD and what follows One cannot leave all the weight of integration on municipalities or volunteering When they arrive on our territory immigrants need not only to receive a bed and something to eat but when they make their citizenship journey to feel truly Italian citizens I confer citizenships but I know perfectly well that there are enormous problems of cultural clashes and if at home the first generation family that has not had an integration gives teachings not in line with our values obviously the boy will never understand what the right line to follow at school one thing is taught at home they teach him maybe another not all because there are also integrated families So you have to act quickly because these episodes are the tip of an iceberg Even in our small centers we notice disturbing phenomena that make us understand that these people do not feel at home and the only way to respect the rules is to feel at home and love the country in which we are located We must therefore help those who arrive in our country to integrate even by limiting arrivals
Mr President ladies and gentlemen Member of the Government the crisis in Ukraine has focused on a subject that of military spending which has actually been the subject of a wide ranging debate and analysis both political and academic over the past few years In the various contexts of deepening in the Commission the need to finance more and at the same time rationalise our military spending has been highlighted on several occasions The great tension caused at this time by a war scenario at the borders of the European Union must not confuse us and distract us from a reform of our security system that is at least necessary It is recalled that the willingness to commit the Atlantic Alliance member countries to reach 2 of GDP for defence expenditure dates back to the NATO summit in Wales in September 2014 In the conclusions of the summit this commitment is found in point 14 In recent years our country has demonstrated its will to respect this promise reversing the trend of lowering military spending that has continued inexorable since the post war period Therefore net of today 's debate it is plausible to think that our country has already planned a path that will lead to the fulfilment of commitments made at international level However I would stress that it is important not to superimpose the conflict situation at our borders with the increase in defence spending That would be a big mistake Talking about rearming is improper confusing public opinion and does not do justice to the immense work that our armed forces do for our country Investing in the defence sector means also and above all investing in research and work It is precisely in the conclusions of the NATO summit mentioned earlier that this concept is expressed Point 14 calls for allies to spend at least 20 of their military expenditure on research and development because our security and defence depend both on how much we spend and how we spend That is why it is certainly important to have a unanimous will reiterated in Parliament But even more fundamental is to have a clear vision of where to go and how to improve our military spending Well the quantitative commitment but that it is accompanied by a commitment of modernization and efficiency A small remark which can be useful for a future debate on the subject to improve defence spending we must aim to have an increasingly structural vision of interforces which goes beyond the current approach of armed force divided into closed and separate sectors With regard to weapon systems aircraft and boats we have great Italian industrial excellences that must be protected and pushed for greater cooperation with other major European and world players The institutions must accompany and support this process Finally invest invest and I repeat still invest in the training processes of our staff which must be trained on the use of complex and constantly updated systems Let us remember that the role of personnel and therefore of human value within the Armed Forces is also greater than the technological capacity of armaments Training and constant updates therefore also wages that are competitive and non mortifying functions reminding us that our Armed Forces must play a different role than that of the Police Forces Allow me Mr President to thank the great work of our women and our men who every day take care of the security of our country They have been fundamental in these two years of pandemics and continue to work daily in the shadows for Italy Military spending means not only war but also justice for these people In conclusion on the Ukrainian question I would like to say a big thank you to our fellow citizens In these weeks I have personally witnessed a real race for solidarity thanks also to the help of the municipalities to help the Ukrainian population both in terms of sending humanitarian aid and in terms of receiving A beautiful example of solidarity and closeness not taken for granted in a period certainly not simple from the economic point of view It is on this and diplomatic efforts in favour of a peaceful resolution that we must work on reaffirming all our opposition to any kind of war
