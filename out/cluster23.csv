#MireiaBorrásPabón,As I said it is a foolish thing to make us believe that billionaires care about the well being of citizens when the reason for their existence is precisely to bleed out the foundations of our democracy which protects the freedom equality and unity of all Spaniards Digital breach You want us to talk about a digital divide But if Bildu is the only gap that matters to him is the gap that breaks down coexistence the gap that discriminates between the Spanish language that breaks down territorial unity and the gap that destroys our rule of law That 's the only breach that matters to Bildu Having said that I have to say that VOX has always defended the need to drastically reduce bureaucracy and reconcile the face to face world with the digital world precisely to ensure that all citizens have access to procedures with the Administration We have recently done so for example in the process of the new common agricultural policy where VOX expressly demanded that digital procedures be made compulsory in order to be able to carry them out immediately and thus save farmers and farmers from the digital discrimination imposed by this Government with its law in a new attempt by the way to attack our primary sector and the rural world But ladies and gentlemen I will tell you something that everyone knows and that is that in VOX we are never going to be accomplices ever ever of any attempt to whitewash the billionaires because even though the terrorist is dressed as a congressman,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,31.912483,4.854202,23,said foolish thing make us believe billionaires care well citizens reason existence precisely bleed foundations democracy protects freedom equality unity spaniards digital breach want us talk digital divide bildu gap matters gap breaks coexistence gap discriminates spanish language breaks territorial unity gap destroys rule law 's breach matters bildu said say vox always defended need drastically reduce bureaucracy reconcile face face world digital world precisely ensure citizens access procedures administration recently done example process new common agricultural policy vox expressly demanded digital procedures made compulsory order able carry immediately thus save farmers farmers digital discrimination imposed government law new attempt way attack primary sector rural world ladies gentlemen tell something everyone knows vox never going accomplices ever ever attempt whitewash billionaires even though terrorist dressed congressman

#JulioUtrillaCano,Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Today we attend the last session of debate on the law of science which this government cooked in the style of I like it and I like it that is without anyone And when the cake came out warm from the Council of Ministers ladies and gentlemen it had more holes than a strainer To cover those holes as far as one of them is concerned Podemos tabled an amendment which was subsequently rejected in the Senate removing the tenth additional provision that had been incorporated into Congress and that we are again debating here today a rocking pimping game between the Legislative Chambers and a clebrón that is incomprehensible to the citizenry and that would have avoided having done things right from the beginning Therefore it is important to recapitulate and explain to the Spaniards what the real reality is The first thing and to put it in context is to say loud and clear that science in Spain is made of foxes Despite the enormous talent that our researchers treasure they are ill treated with poor wages VOX denounced from this rostrum the milleurist payrolls of professionals with more than twenty years of experience It must be said that they work suffocated by a thick bureaucracy and that we have a massive exodus of young talent abroad And worst of all and the key we have under financing of 1.4 of our GDP far far away ladies and gentlemen from 2.3 which is the European average and in light years from the countries leading Europe such as Switzerland or Sweden above 3 This is the sad reality ladies and gentlemen and it is neither the fruit of Putin nor the virus nor even of Franco believe me The leaders of this demeaning capital are the alternation governments of the Socialist Party and the People 's Party You have managed the science of Spain in the last forty years and are the creators of this dramatic situation But let us focus on what has been the trajectory of this law Although the scientific world unanimously called for a pact for the science of all political forces this government from the minute one applies an anti-democratic cord to VOX and excluded us from knowing the initial text and of course inviting us to sign it It is fair to say that only one citizen 's deputy Marta Martín had the courage to raise her voice and denounce this injustice He is no longer here today by his own decision but I would like to thank him with all my heart from this rostrum Gentlemen of the Government with these additions you do not silence the deputies of VOX what you do is gag the four million voters of the third political force of Spain there can be no more petty or undemocratic act The Spaniards must be told that this government understands science as a tool for its propaganda It fills their mouths with the importance of science and then ends up as always leaving it in the gutter They already did so with scientists during the pandemic when they declared them nonessential combining them in their homes without allowing them to work In Spain during that period one could reform his kitchen because the professionals who worked there had been considered essential but you illegally and unconstitutionally left the scientists locked up in their homes The Spanish have to know that in this Congress a subcommission was created with twenty six first level experts to listen to their proposals and incorporate them into the law of science some of them international eminences and that this Government did not wait for their appearances to end the Government approved in the Council of Ministers the text of the law without all of them intervening here Once again they trampled on science What disrespect and defach gentlemen But today they again despise science with the decree in which they state that workplaces should not exceed the 27th and exclude for example hairdressers which seems phenomenal to us ladies and gentlemen but forget about scientific laboratories Do you think it 's healthy really that our scientists work 27o with robes propylene gloves lab glasses and handling substances like ether or acetone which at these temperatures generate flammable gases They do n't have to answer us because we know it 's absolutely the same The Spanish must also be told that during the period of its proceedings this government promoted labour reform which jeopardized the future of more than 25 000 researchers Not only did they show a total lack of coordination between the portfolios but they also showed an enormous pre-potence disheartening the directors of the Spanish universities who alerted them at the beginning of the year It must be explained that this Government which says that it never leaves anyone behind forgot in its law about technical professionals management professionals even health researchers and that only with amendments from the rest of the party groups was it possible to correct this unacceptable forgetfulness It must be said that its law does not guarantee investment despite the fact that its media machinery sold the shielding of the financing of science in a bowl and bowl You conditioned it to budget availability for each year a package armor that had to be amended once again to ensure investment in science This law includes improvements but it is not the definitive solution to the labor instability of the scientific world Behind this lies an endemic problem of lack of funding a structural failure that you could have addressed if you had broad sightedness and courage Do you want to explain to us how they will finance science when they do not have European funds Gentlemen of the Government this has been a chronicle of the missed opportunity You had in your hands touching it with your fingers the possibility of putting aside sectarianism and partisan interests and having truly bet on science But to ask this government not to be sectarian even if it embraces common sense is like asking the elm or grapes to the thorn a veritable mischief Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,35.328915,4.570119,23,thank president good afternoon ladies gentlemen today

#PatriciaRuedaPerelló,Good afternoon VOX brings to this House an urgent motion on the measures that the Government is going to take to protect the tourism sector Yes urgent because since March 2020 the Government has declared the state of alarm recognized as unconstitutional thanks to VOX it has been two years two years since they trampled on the Constitution kidnapped Congress by paralysing legislative activity and curtailed rights and freedoms by prohibiting the Spanish from working almost twenty four months of prohibitions and restrictions that have harmed the tourism sector in particular and all sectors in general They will go up to this rostrum saying that yes they have helped them they will say that they helped them with that royal decree that came late and bad late because they presented it nine months after the pandemic began and bad because it offered only indebtedness and postponement They will say that the royal decree that of the famous aid excluding by the CNAE with an insufficient amount that makes access to the aid impossible and that does not make an equitable distribution And then you will have another royal decree which generates discrimination between sectors and companies according to the community or autonomous city in which you live While they are dedicated to complicating everything not fulfilling their promises there is cold and hungry out there because while the PP and PSOE are in their dimes and direct out there it is cold it is cold because there are many Spaniards who cannot even turn on their stove thanks to the rise of light and it is cold because time runs against it and live it with despair because they have been two years with falling billing rising taxes uncertainty uneven regulations according to who governs two years of prohibitions and aid that do not arrive They were forbidden to work what if they were compensated for it They do n't want help they want to let them work and leave them alone I am talking about the government of the nation but I also spoke of autonomous governments such as that of Andalusia with a Moreno Bonilla who imposes a COVID passport on us undermining rights and freedoms or that of Castile and León led by the People 's Party which also imposes restrictions and where aid does not arrive We said it months ago they would have to have applied a very simple formula which VOX proposed in this rostrum on the basis of a very objective criterion the fall of the billing We demand aid and compensation from any company in any sector that has seen its income lost But of course they have to come and complicate everything and it is such a ignorance that for example in their decrees they have established as a requirement for access to aid that would not have been declared a negative result for economic activities in 2019 without taking into account that in these cases the negative results have different interpretations depending on the investment curve the depreciation strategy and economic projections I speak as a deputy of VOX which is an honor and as a tourism professional and I am told by my colleagues in the profession they can no longer I read your decrees and listen to your interventions and we see that you have no idea what it means to lift a blind to look at a door waiting for a client or to touch that cold door to attract you you do n't know what it is to liquidate VAT or the titanic task of managing and controlling a cost structure be it a big company a SME or a micro SME and the sector tells you and you do n't listen to them In your padded armchairs you can spend another day but for the self employed for the entrepreneur for the workers every day counts That is why we urge the Government to act urgently in favour of a dying sector because we are desperate and are told this by the hospitality representatives in Segovia who said I quote literally that the time is coming to pay the ICOs and we do not have to pay And we are told by the representatives of active tourism in Palencia and the hoteliers of Ávila they can no longer And they do n't tell me just because we 've been campaigning now they 've been telling me for months years But for that you have to step on the ground you have to listen and you have to work Tourism is employment tourism is wealth tourism is a smile Tourism is Carlos and his travel agency it is Teresa who gets up at two in the morning to take his taxi at four o'clock that to which they have now climbed as to all Spaniards fuel they are Mar and Elvira who manage a fabulous museum in Malaga it is Federico with his audiovisual company in the management of events it is Juan Carlos and his food distribution company it is Julio and his consultancy they are Reme and Gema hairdressers it is Carmen and his neighborhood trade it is the whole value chain of tourism and it is obligatory to protect it to protect the tourist industry that contributes so much to Spain because it contributes in terms of employment happiness and image Or are n't they happy when they see a sunset on the beach a sunrise on the mountain or have a coffee on a terrace Look I could tell you about a lot of data the INE Frontur surveys the Egatur surveys the EPA survey published by Turespana which confirms the number of employed people unfortunately who have lost their jobs All these figures which show the loss of millions of euros the massive destruction of jobs and the deteriorated image of Spain have a face and have a name But now what I want as a tourism professional is to send a message of hope to all the professionals who strive every day to provide the best of services I know that this government does not have a plan or if it has a plan it is the destruction of Spain I know that this government is encircling our rights and our freedoms but out there and here there are a handful of brave people who do not resign and that we will continue to fight every day for Spain And Spain are its bars and Spain is its people and Spain is night entertainment its bulls and flamenco our popular parties the beach and the mountain its fortresses and castles its towns and cities its spices and its exquisite gastronomy Spain is the legacy of our grandparents it is the legacy that we will leave to those who come behind Spain is the primary sector it is the industry And it 's not written that we have to resign ourselves and we 're not going to resign ourselves to the policies of the usual parties because now VOX is here and there 's a battalion of millions of people who say it 's okay because they want hope they want peace prosperity life freedom and equality Finished Love does not delight in evil but rejoices in the truth Everything you believe everything you

#CristinaAliciaEstebanCalonje,"Ladies and gentlemen it goes without saying that we are going to say no to this savagery that it does nothing but protect crime We are not going to support this infamous way of frivolating with something as sensitive and dramatic as people in vulnerable situations Okupas are not vulnerable consumers because the only thing consumed by the Okupas is the property of others the property of others the resources and mental health of good Spanish citizens who witness astonishment at how their rights are curtailed because this Government protects protects promotes and encourages illegal okupation Article 47 of the Constitution gives you the public authorities a mandate to ensure access to housing In times like those we are experiencing this happens because they solve the structural deficit of public housing and social rent and facilitate the supply of housing Okupation ladies and gentlemen is the way It is not the mechanism for access to decent and adequate housing This law is an armed robbery of the savers It is an indirect expropriation of the houses of the Spaniards And you know what Of the houses found in the most humble neighborhoods which are suffering 80 of this scourge in the face of the indolence of the public authorities This is not a vulnerable consumer defense this is an attack on our rule of law and you know quite well if not you yes the army of advisors who work for you that it is unconstitutional That is why VOX has already brought its 14th appeal before the Constitutional Court Not to mention the parties referring to ports hydraulics and discharges which have nothing to do with the title and which violate article 245 of our Criminal Code But of course they have to give content to a ministry of girl and turnip which should never have gone from general leadership and defend their positions within this infamous government and will resolve the Constitutional Court within a couple of years while they already have their budgets tied up which is really what interests them For something they voted against our initiative to limit the time limits of the Constitutional Court 's resolution It is the PSOE style to legislate unconstitutionally to please their bands and then when the Constitutional Court resolves skins to the sea However along the way there are victims who feel helpless and helpless when they claim their rights before a Government that is transferring a responsibility that is theirs from the Government to them They transfer the problem of housing to the owners thus transferring the situation of vulnerability to the owners as well Vulnerable consumers are the Spaniards who see 72 light up 23 gasoline 23 housing and who see the IPC shot and a shopping basket that is increasingly difficult for them to fill Vulnerable Consumer is Maria Luisa a 57 year old woman who has been in need of psychological help for two years the years her tenant does not pay her the rent of her house in Carabanchel Alto In five years he had no problems but the pandemic arrived and his tenant took over his social shield and stopped paying Maria Luisa is living well she 's sleeping on a friend 's couch A friend less bad than there are good people who in turn lives with her husband daughter in law two children and a grandson And meanwhile María Luisa continues to pay for the expenses of supplies of her inqui okupa the expenses of her housing and the judicial expenses Vulnerable consumer is Bethlehem of Benalmadena who after three years two weeks ago has recovered his home Yes the 86 metre house that his father left him where he grew up and spent his childhood He has recovered it destroyed without appliances completely vandalized and has had to pay 38,000 euros between supplies lawyers prosecutors and for that he has had to be indebted Now fixing the house would cost you another 30,000 euros and you do n't have them Who 's the vulnerable In VOX we have it clear we offer law and order and social housing Law and order as in the proposals of law that we have presented before this House to provide legal tools to our Security Forces and Bodies in order to immediately evict and raise the penalties of usurpation of property which are now punished only by a fine to four years in prison Of course that 's another one With the reform of the Criminal Code of the People 's Party in 2015 illegal misappropriation went from a serious crime to the new category of minor crime which is merely an administrative sanction It is just that you too ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party have given these criminals a very easy clue You have not come to improve the lives of anyone but yourself They use other people 's property and create legal insecurity when what they have to do is build social housing and facilitate the offer to improve access and scour prices Can you imagine if those who preceded us had not had legal certainty Do you think anyone would have built something And now they come with the threatening new housing law to give more legal insecurity and completely strangle the housing supply all the fruit of budgetary negotiations between you that have nothing to do with solving the problem They have already been warned by the General Council of the Judiciary of the legal uncertainty of the rule and of interference in private property and do not give them the approval but they do not care Mr Sicilia has already come out to say that he is sucking her that they are going to disregard the position of the General Council of the Judiciary and they are going to implement the same law Law and order ladies and gentlemen Law and order to protect our citizens Law and order to maintain the foundations of our rule of law freedom equality and property

#CristinaAliciaEstebanCalonje,Thank you very much Madam President Any proposal aimed at ending the optupation will always find the support of the VOX Parliamentary Group either in Congress or in any other institution in Spain But let 's start at the beginning Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party when they reformed the Criminal Code in 2015 to make the crime of illegal usurpation of real estate that is octopus a minor crime that is they put this crime at the same level as sipping a chocolate in Mercadona And of course with these limbs with this Penal Code that you ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party the judges have to issue their sentences And it 's not that judges are macho and patriarchal As strong as judges want to be as unfair as it may seem to them as it is that they deprive you of a good as precious as your home are the tools that are within their reach Okupa is fined and will be taken elsewhere Whether trespassing or unlawful usurpation possession must be returned immediately to its legitimate owner VOX will toughen the penalties and return to a rational penal system when we rule Okupación is one of the many debates that has brought VOX to this House Since governing the left it is true that illegal octopus has tripled but Rajoy 's last three years from 2015 to 2018 octopus had already increased by 18 and was a cry in the street This proposal for a law that you registered in August takes almost point by point what we already presented in June Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party when they copy us they 're right Copy it more and better They are however committed to leaving out the concern something which I hope they will be well advised to include within the time frame of amendments to this bill if the Communist seditious separatist and heirs of ETA approve their consideration Ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party you come here very concerned about the safety of people and things in the communities of owners We are too terribly concerned but I ask why in the Community of Madrid despite the insistence of VOX do not do anything to solve it in the social housing of IVIMA Attention okupas regularized by the People 's Party in Madrid last year 115 okupas in 2020 regularized 91 okupas in 2019 regularized 183 okupas in 2018 253 okupas over 461 signed contracts more than half 55 of new contracts were for okupas criminals because in 2018 VOX was still not blowing their necks Do you know what this means for neighborly coexistence What 's the matter because they 're social housing they have to put up with this Because making social housing is not just promoting it cutting the tape taking the picture and delivering the housing then you have to manage it They regularize okupas with false reports with opinions from neighbors who are coerced The solution they are offering to these families who can no longer is to see if they change their promotion So you treat the tenants as if they were the problem and no the culprit is the okupa Last Friday here in Congress my parliamentary group organized a forum to deal with the problem of illegal okupation and anxiety I would like you to see and here are the videos how one of the tenants of the public housing that you manage broke by giving your testimony He was telling us what does it mean to live with okupas They probably know dirt crime danger fear threats fighting drugs These families are living in conditions that are less worthy of anything You regularize the Okupas of the IVIMA housing to clean up your Excel and the Okupas criminals become full contractors while there are thousands of families doing queues that are not accessing social housing and it is not fair Because no ladies and gentlemen that 's not the solution The solution is to want for these families what you are claiming here today in the Congress of Deputies Okupas must be excluded from any social assistance because the Okupas are not vulnerable the Okupas are criminals Another thing is the families that are really going through a situation of fragility These honorable families must be helped to pass the drink and be able to go ahead without chronizing their poverty without quantifying their dependence without promoting political clientelism This obligation to help because it is an obligation is the responsibility of the public authorities Demagogues and populists are constantly trying to confront in a manipulated manner articles 47 and 33 of our Constitution thus avoiding the responsibility of the public authorities and transferring this burden to private property In VOX we want to provide legal tools to the forces and security forces for immediate eviction to fight against the mafia and other intermediaries of the Okupas to prevent the pattern and the constitution of the house of the Okupas to legitimize the communities of owners to sue the Okupas and we also ask for the creation of a register of sentences for unpaid rents to fight against the inquio okupation And not only that the owner can claim the return of the IBI which also but urge the municipalities to then claim these amounts to the okupas We know that the Government is on the side of the criminals and all the enemies of Spain which well are the same You 're the worst nightmare the Spaniards have In VOX we assure you that we will rebuild everything you have destroyed Thank

#CristinaAliciaEstebanCalonje,Minister Sánchez already a portfolio in hand defends limiting rental prices And the PSOE who has been able to bargain even with the executioners of his own fellow rowers tied the budgets of the ruin and brought us this uninhabitable housing law Actually gentlemen of the PSOE it was not necessary because they had approved them equally Here are the NATO no bases out grabbing your chair They would n't have gone anywhere Where are they going In real estate as in any other sector price variations are a clear consequence of the basic law of supply and demand In particular in Spain wild price rises especially in rent have taken place in large cities and tourist centres And why Because the supply has been unable to absorb demand Public actions should encourage supply and not be totalitarian control measures They begin with reference to article 47 of the Spanish Constitution However the Government has not understood the right itself nor that the mandate to guarantee this right is addressed to the public authorities not to the citizens When establishing restrictions on private property the legislator must respect the fair balance between the means employed and the intended purpose Income control forced extensions IBI surcharges of up to 150 protection of the okupas and tenants With the measures contained in this bill you have surpassed the just balance A law aimed at guaranteeing access to housing which I repeat is an obligation of the public authorities cannot be fully supported by measures of interference in private property It is not that we do not like interventionist measures Mrs Garrido but that they do not work and produce the opposite effect By the way Mrs Garrido there is no title 47 of the Spanish Constitution The Spanish Constitution has ten titles On 27 January the General Council of the Judiciary issued a report on this bill which points to serious shortcomings both in form and substance a demolishing opinion that the Government of the Ruin has decided to ignore International evidence as in Berlin or Paris confirms that income limitation achieves exactly the opposite effect It achieves the creation of an illegal market the reduction in the investment of rental housing both for purchase and maintenance and rehabilitation the reduction of workers mobility and the segmentation of the population according to their purchasing power Because they do n't think this is going to affect people with the greatest purchasing power Those who will suffer as always are the humblest families and middle classes These practical cases are well known and hence the negative assessment of the General Council of the Judiciary since the Government has not carried out any assessment of the social benefits and disadvantages to justify the containment of income They have not included in the bill an evaluation studying the impact of this measure because its negative impact is widely known,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,37.363407,0.8956793,23,minister sánchez already portfolio hand defends limiting rental prices psoe able bargain even executioners fellow rowers tied budgets ruin brought us uninhabitable housing law actually gentlemen psoe necessary approved equally nato bases grabbing chair would n't gone anywhere going real estate sector price variations clear consequence basic law supply demand particular spain wild price rises especially rent taken place large cities tourist centres supply unable absorb demand public actions encourage supply totalitarian control measures begin reference article 47 spanish constitution however government understood right mandate guarantee right addressed public authorities citizens establishing restrictions private property legislator must respect fair balance means employed intended purpose income control forced extensions ibi surcharges 150 protection okupas tenants measures contained bill surpassed balance law aimed guaranteeing access housing repeat obligation public authorities cannot fully supported measures interference private property like interventionist measures mrs garrido work produce opposite effect way mrs garrido title 47 spanish constitution spanish constitution ten titles 27 january general council judiciary issued report bill points serious shortcomings form substance demolishing opinion government ruin decided ignore international evidence berlin paris confirms income limitation achieves exactly opposite effect achieves creation illegal market reduction investment rental housing purchase maintenance rehabilitation reduction workers mobility segmentation population according purchasing power n't think going affect people greatest purchasing power suffer always humblest families middle classes practical cases well known hence negative assessment general council judiciary since government carried assessment social benefits disadvantages justify containment income included bill evaluation studying impact measure negative impact widely known

#CristinaAliciaEstebanCalonje,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Interior replied in writing that the illegal occupations have increased by 45 since 2018 however already Minister Campo accused our Senator Yolanda Melero of alarming and echoing the fake news the Minister of Justice Here in this very rostrum accused us of being afraid Vice President Díaz who is angry when anti-Okupation measures are presented says that the okupation does not exist and to finish Minister Montero the one that gives the most says that the okupation is an invention of VOX Home invasion or home usurpation is equally illegal and we want them out immediately But do we have laws in Spain to fight against ocupation Yes we do but they 're deficient What happens in Spain has no match in Europe In Germany France the United Kingdom and the Netherlands new legislation has been put in place to adapt to this reality And yes Mr Bal in those countries the eviction is immediate and resolved at police headquarters and then the trials are already taking place The good citizen is no longer believing in justice it is cheaper to pay the okupa than time stress worries lawyers and pay everything he has to pay to kick him out They are making it easy for the Okupas to coerce and extort and as we continue to allow neighboring patrols to partner to fight for the security of their neighborhoods this will end up like the wild west In this House it is where we have to give them a solution and it is not a question of being insensitive illegal occupation is not because there is a lack of social housing which of course is lacking at least two and a half million social housing units to place us only on the European average You promised 20,000 homes in 2018 and have not built one Social Services does not have the means to study the real situation they have to rely on the declaration of which it is said to be vulnerable and the Government which is incompetent to provide a housing solution denies the reality of the ocupation looks to the other side and bears that responsibility to the owners In raids or usurpations the normal thing as in all other crimes and regardless of the end result the normal thing would be the restitution of the immediate possession to its legitimate owner But why do n't the police act Because it does not have a clear legal framework or direct instructions for doing so So of course companies like Desocupa come up who do the mediation that the police should be able to do but they can't And those affected Mr. Mayoral are not Blackstone Cerberus or Morgan Stanley they are owners communities of neighbors and entire neighborhoods Illegal occupations have been occurring since 2012 and 2013 and have been growing and this is what we are talking about on the subway In VOX we have been presenting initiatives and proposals against ocupation since we entered this Congress In June this year we presented another proposal for a law combining initiatives that we had previously put forward to take action against octopus and harassment And you ladies and gentlemen of the PP presented your copy and paste of our proposal in August Well well ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party As we always tell them when they copy VOX they 're right You are asking in your motion to reinforce the penalties for the crime of usurpation but it is that it was you in your reform of the Criminal Code in 2015 who passed the usurpation to mild crime They ask to consider the registration of an okupa in the padrón null and ladies and gentlemen also in 2015 you issued a resolution by which the okupas could register anywhere regardless of whether they had an enabling title to reside there And now horses are laid when the Sánchez government in 2020 makes this same resolution or when the Sánchez government deals with separatists Have you forgotten the Covenant of the Majestic But I insist when PP copies VOX it 's right When we talked about energy sovereignty you accused us of wanting to go back to what autarchy and now you 're talking about energy sovereignty We do n't finally see their deputies with that pin of fucking agenda colors that they imposed on us in 2015 and that 's ruining our fields and our economy Now I ask you since you copy us you copy us completely and do not leave out the reality of worry These are the tenants who become okupas with premeditation

#RocíoDeMeerMéndez,Thank you Mr. President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Almost four million Spaniards have put us in this House to stop absolutely all the trophies carried out by the government that we are suffering in all areas both in the area that is going to occupy us in the debate now and in the area of the attack on the institutions that are so serious that we are living in the last few days And I assure you that we will not stop until we give back the voice to the Spaniards who belong to them The subject of the debate that we are now beginning is the proposed law presented by the VOX Parliamentary Group for the amendment of Law 7/1985 of 2 April Regulator of the Local Regime This initiative is crucial to addressing one of the most important problems that our country is facing in recent years which is well known to you and which is often denied to you which is the problem of mass immigration One of the circumstances that allows one of the open doors in this system of open borders is also the open door that exists in the civil neighbourhood system of some municipalities and it is that in cases of occupation and illegal immigration there are some municipalities in which to register is too simple and in the end this constitutes a fraud to our public system and a fraud in short to our social service system Ladies and gentlemen in this debate I would like us to address an issue that is often in your mouths and which however seems that most of you lack the basic meaning or the basic elements of the most elementary notion of what constitutes social justice Ladies and gentlemen social justice is not about ending hunger in the world because it is impossible Social justice is not to end hunger in the world with general budgets of the State the general budgets of the State of Spain because it is impossible and to say the opposite it is nothing other than lying to the Spaniards it is an act of hypocrisy Ladies and gentlemen social justice is not bringing seven million Africans without resources to our country because it is said by a ministry because they say a number of economic powers that in the face of Europe 's demographic decline we need slave and mass labour to cover precarious jobs Ladies and gentlemen social justice would not be this because it is common sense common sense which although common is unfortunately the least common sense in this House It is common sense that if we bring seven million Africans without resources to our country in the coming years we would not be reducing poverty but we would increase it exactly by seven million people But it is also a very elementary notion of social justice that purporting to bring seven million people without resources to our country is also an act of hypocrisy when in Spain and in the light of the latest data there are 13 million people at risk of social exclusion and poverty It is a very serious act of hypocrisy and it is absolutely contrary to social justice Ladies and gentlemen social justice would help these 13 million people at risk of poverty Social justice would end the two and a half million people in severe poverty Social justice would be to build the three and a half million official protection homes that are still needed in Spain only to be on the average in the European countries around us Social justice would be a real end to energy poverty The other day I had the opportunity to visit as we all often do in our political activity a residential center with people with disabilities and highly dependent in this intellectual case We see large figures in the general budgets of the State but when we go to small associations when we go to small residences we see as in this particular centre how social justice really is far from being achieved It is a center that had difficulty paying the bills of light recent bills of light that amounted to 8500 euros It is a center that does social work in each of the municipalities of Spain and if politicians are not to fix the lives of people who really need it politicians do not serve at all Ladies and gentlemen do you not realize that not only these thirteen million people at risk of poverty or the two million people at risk of severe poverty or the small centres as I have just told you which exist in virtually all the municipalities of Spain if they do not have their basic needs covered we cannot afford to accommodate seven million people without resources from other countries Do n't you realize the enormous and gigantic hypocrisy that this is A consultant GIS has recently carried out a study indicating that foreigners which is well known to you account for about 11.4 of the population and consume around 50 of public aid for poverty That is that half of the public aid in Spain we are not using for social justice we are using it to open borders and harm the most vulnerable Spaniards Ladies and gentlemen the standard unfortunately is the tool used for access to public aid in a fraudulent way and is also a tool that suits you because at the end of the day it has a so called effect and you can continue to talk about water to the international economic powers Ladies and gentlemen you live very well in your manuals of political theory you live very well in your idealism we tell you every day but every day we check it with greater vehemence live away from what the Spaniards feel and suffer in their neighborhoods In your manuals you come to say that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people can come to integrate and work in a possible and magical multiculturalism in which cultural origin is equal and this is also a lie If they paid less attention to their political theory manuals and more attention to what humble Spaniards suffered in their homes they would realize We have explained it a thousand times and we will do it again without getting tired because for that they have put so many Spaniards here who suffer it day by day immigration and crime are related this is common sense and is elementary criminology Ladies and gentlemen there is a crime factor that is indeed cultural There is an imported crime There are forms of crime that are possible in many countries in our environment and that are not characteristic of our culture But there is also an increase in common crime which is also an elementary notion of criminology because it is normal for common crime to increase when we bring massively people from places where there are forms of common crime such as rapes which occur 80 times more than in our indigenous societies It 's elementary criminology and it's common sense and we 'll say it every time we can However today I would like to dwell on one of the great losers in the mass immigration debate women There is a great difference between European civilization and other opposing cultures and it is that for Christian civilization women have always been the soul of Europe However for other cultures women are the slave of man and you are massively importing people from these cultures If you import massively people from Nigeria Malawi Swaziland Zimbabwe Cameroon from all these countries you will see on our streets customs of these countries In Spain we can already see female genital mutilation According to a study by the Autonomous University of Barcelona according to data from the National Institute of Statistics in Spain there are 3652 girls at risk of female genital mutilation thanks to their open border policies In Spain we are also seeing girls at risk of forced marriages There are other cultures that also have institutional figures such as polygamy which are also tremendously unfair to women There are also crimes of honour we have all seen videos of absolutely brutal stoning in Nigeria and this is a culture that we must not respect that we must fight because it is in our origins and it is in our nature to fight a barbarity such as a stoning or a forced marriage There you also say many times that you are how was it the granddaughters of the witches that we could n't burn or something like that say right Well there are countries where women are really being burned for witchcraft You 're massively importing people from those countries here In their manuals of political theory they also say that ocupation is a problem of the powerful of the banks and of the investment funds and however a large volume of occupation is due to another very different reality Okupación is in the hands of mafias who take advantage of human suffering who take advantage of poverty and who trade with people who do not have a roof who do not have a shelter You ladies and gentlemen dance the water to those mafias who turn buildings into drug and prostitution supermarkets which destroy neighborhoods where before better or worse at least one could live Ladies and gentlemen living in a safe neighborhood should n't be a privilege for the rich You have made it into that you have made it a luxury within the reach of very few and if you ever close your policy manuals,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,36.581875,6.765017,23,thank mr. president good afternoon ladies

#RocíoDeMeerMéndez,Thank you Mr. President We came here to discuss a motion resulting from an urgent inquiry by the People 's Group an inquiry last week to the Minister of the Interior recommending his action in the massive assaults of the previous week on the Melilla fence I must say that this motion that you have tabled has proved to be deeply disconcerting to us Firstly you say that the PP rejects the so called effect that it rejects the open doors that it rejects the massive regulations and that it rejects the ships of the NGOs You Rajoy 's party are the registrar of the property that he said he did n't believe in the borders the party that regularizes immigrants with food bills the party of massive regularizations before Zapatero 480 185 illegal immigrants and already with Rajoy 360 000 illegal immigrants the party of Feijóo which has said that it wants to speed up access to nationality the party also of Feijóo which offers in its day Galicia for the reception of immigrants arriving from the ship Aquarius and which offers collaboration with Doctors without Borders or SOS Mediterranean NGOs that as you all know collaborate with the mafias of human trafficking You also say that the People 's Party rejects the dispersion of irregular immigrants throughout the national geography and you reject it so much that Feijóo was also talking about welcoming all the menas who had arrived in Ceuta so much so that Juanma Moreno spends two million euros on welcoming immigrants and asks to disperse all those who arrive in the Canary Islands throughout the national geography so much so that the Junta de Castilla y León will open a menas centre in Salamanca right next to an elderly residence But you also say that in order to protect our borders we have to deploy Frontex and this is what someone says that I do n't know if he does n't know what he 's saying or wants to fool us because Frontex is useless Frontex has n't expelled a single immigrant since he 's been on the move Frontex serves to continue sending files to Warsaw if that 's what you want to do but of course that 's not protecting our borders Stop thinking that everything is going to work out for us in Brussels because the reality is that we are alone and that we have to deploy our own resources You also say that you have to do training exercises for our Armed Forces to collaborate with our state security forces and bodies What this Minister of the Interior has to do is to allow our state security forces and bodies to use anti-disturbing material to protect a border which is what is done in Greece and Poland And what our Armed Forces have to do is not training maneuvers what this Government has to do is deploy our Armed Forces in situations of tension on the southern border because you all agree to send arms to defend Ukraine 's sovereignty but no one here agrees to defend Spanish sovereignty on the southern border I 'm going to stop at your star size You propose to include Ceuta and Melilla in the Schengen area Do you really think that 's how they 're gonna better protect the border Do they really say that A party that has ruled this country and that wants to protect a border proposes that Ceuta and Melilla be included in the Schengen area that is they want to remove border control more from those who jump the fence Also if you want we lower the fence a little bit to make them jump more easily What needs to be done with Ceuta and Melilla is to introduce them under NATO 's umbrella for protection to see if the international organizations in which Spain is going to defend our interests are really going to do so because it happens what always happens that Spain is abroad that Spain is in international organizations and at the time of truth no one defends their interests You are left with the perfect package of effect called and the reality is that it suits me because you and your spokespersons have repeatedly said that mass immigration is the way to combat ageing it is the way to combat the demographic challenge You have said so both in initiatives in the Senate and in your spokesmen such as Mr Feijóo And it suits me because you are actually in the same package as all parties in this House except one which is the package as good signatories to Agenda 2030 to combat the demographic decline of Europe with massive immigration with all that it entails But there 's one thing I do n't care about about your initiative and it's that sometimes you say words as an assailant as an invasion as a collapse of social services like immigration makes living

to be returned this bill so much is the ignorance or malice that rhymes But let 's go to the core If the Government which claims to believe in the public sector had really wanted to improve public health it would have brought concrete measures to improve it and not future mirages It could have brought about a reform of the General Health Act or a reform of the harmful human resources policy Instead it seeks to dispense with the collaboration of private health in a hypocritical and surreptitious manner It is hypocritical to suppress private concerts when officials and we the Members of Parliament enjoy a capacity of choice between the public and the private that the rest of the citizens do not have The Lordships of Podemos have it clear they want to suppress these mutualities they are communists They will then have the private doctor who goes to Galapagar 's villa the private nurse and other minucias right On the contrary VOX wants all Spaniards to be able to be served with their health card anywhere in Spain and in addition it will work to ensure that all Spaniards have the same privilege that officials and you now enjoy freedom of choice The Darias project wants to suppress collaboration with the private in a surreptitiously way The minister does not dare to ban concerts but demands that public health managers meet requirements that are impossible to meet simply because they do not exist Ladies and gentlemen public and private health are already integrated via concerts This collaboration optimizes resources and helps the sustainability of the system Data 38 of private hospitals have some concert with public health concerts are 10 of health expenditure 8587 million 60 of which is for hospital expenses 8.7 of surgical interventions are performed under concert 9.2 of radiotherapy sessions with linear accelerator and according to a study currently in print prices at private concerts are 32 or 90 of a median 40 cheaper to equal diagnosis and procedure The contribution of the private sector is so great that it is neither rational nor feasible to dispense with it as the consequence will be to decrease health care and its quality and the final effect will be to go against the same principles that you claim to defend We reject this bill and we do so in its entirety because first it is a statist almost communist project that wants to de facto ban health concerts it contravenes the spirit of the General Health Law 14/1986 which includes and includes the conventions in the concerts articles 66 67 and 90 and which requires that health services should be given according to efficiency speed and economy it contravenes the spirit of the Law on Cohesion and Quality of the National Health System 16/2003 of 28 May which in its article 2 g establishes public private collaboration as a general principle and that health care should be given within a specified maximum time Everyone here including the minister knows that ending the concerts is going to lengthen the waiting lists The kick to private health will be given to patients of public health Secondly this project has no empirical basis The memory cites three studies none conclusive and the best which is a review of studies says that the studies they have reviewed are not of sufficient quality and therefore nothing can be concluded Thirdly the bill is contradictory On the one hand it recognizes that public management is inefficient but the mechanisms of its improvement are not put in place and it only provides as a solution to make concerts with the private as an improvement impossible A lady limps down the street carries a crutch comes the person who has made this project and kicks the crutch What 's going to happen Will she come out saying I 'm cured I 'm cured Or will the chrism break with the sidewalk For that woman is public health right now because they are talking about establishing measures to establish good governance in the future Observe what the Economic and Social Council 's opinion says I hope After more than twenty five years of development there has so far been a lack of a system of evaluation of health results to facilitate the proper use of public resources close quotes Ladies and gentlemen believe me I have been working for forty three years exclusively for public hospitals only in public hospitals and this is not just about indicators It is arranged when at all levels of public health first the wage increases which is of misery the good worker is rewarded and the bad one is punished and that with the current system is impossible I stress it The first and central article of this projector is criticized by the Economic and Social Council itself when it says that it is indeterminate and imprecise about the criteria for establishing concerts I do not think so Minister as the Economic and Social Council says because how can I demand that they say that the resources have been used optimally optimally when the criteria are not even set to see whether they have been done well only well Fourthly this project is absolutely inopportune 706 740 patients waiting the waiting time is now four months the specialist list has increased by 27 in 2021 3.2 million with a waiting time of three months Consequences of avoiding concerts increase the waiting time in surgeries to six months in consultations to five increase morbidity and mortality and increase public health spending in an interval of 1500 to 3000 million euros If we want to reduce the waiting list it is reasonable to do the opposite to go to private health care which has sufficient resources Fifthly this project lacks a credible economic basis and runs counter to the principles of resource efficiency Organic Law 2/2012 Only from the socialist bald concept that public money is nobody 's can it be said as is done here you laugh that the economic impact is going to be 20 million euros But hey if there 's going to be a 40 extra administrative cost Sixth and I 'm finishing huge judicialization This is what 's going to happen You 've already dealt with the independenceists okay Seventhly the concept of equity is inseparable from that of justice and it is impossible for this bill to produce justice when it does not put in place the means to improve public health and technical and human resources for our public health to have efficient contrasted and audited health management On the other hand the concept of universality has been perverted What was initially the logical desire for all Spaniards to have health care regardless of their state of insurance has been extended to all the inhabitants of the world they lack health coverage for the Klingon ladies and gentlemen And while granting total total health care rights throughout the Spanish territory including transplantation to illegal immigrants the Spaniards are prevented from circulating and having health care with the health card in the Spanish territory Moreover in this bill the Spanish residents Dutch Mrs Darias who are working for example in Germany are required that when they get sick in Spain they show that the disease has happened to them while visiting their grandmother and that is not done with illegal immigrants What is that Mrs. Darias I 'm going to tell you what it is well I 'm not going to tell you well yes almost hispanophobia I conclude ladies and gentlemen This bill is not only unfair to the Spaniards and legal residents but it is a fine example of the hatred that socialism has for everything private To dispense with private health is not only a political and economic mistake but will multiply waiting lists diminishing health care and its quality Therefore in VOX we say that this bill should not be dealt with we hope your support because it lacks a rational foundation and because the spirit that guides it which is partisan and spurious will generate the opposite of what you say less equity less accessibility and therefore more disease and less health In VOX we want a simple thing and it is summed up in a phrase freedom also in health Thank you very

#MaríaDeLaCabezaRuizSolás,Thank you President Good morning ladies and gentlemen Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Group when you brought your non-law proposal here to improve the working conditions of female domestic workers back in May we already told you what VOX thinks about it that all Spanish workers must be defended that all Spanish workers have the right to stable jobs with decent wages that we must combat job insecurity and ensure the reconciliation of families that we must promote the rise of all wages especially the lowest ones and that we must promote stable lasting and quality employment We told you to first of all make it clear that you always lie when you talk about VOX but also to show that it is you all of you and not us who having ruled this country for many years have discriminated against the household employees collective You have discriminated against them by denying access to unemployment benefits to date We also told them that in VOX we give immense value to the work of domestic workers a work that we know is hard and ungrateful but also very dignified and indispensable for the community because it depends on it that families can reconcile their working life with their family life But we also told them what our position was with regard to Spanish families and their needs and we demanded a regulation that encourages and facilitates the recruitment of these much needed workers because all the women we work outside the home whatever our condition we need help even a few hours and because there are families that make a huge economic effort to be able to reconcile their working life with their personal life to the point that on many occasions they are almost more interested in staying at home than going out to work Already then we demanded a regulation that would be good for both domestic workers and their employers a regulation that favors this process by making it simple and that would not put all the economic burden on families However now they come and bring this to us and bring it to us in the form of a royal decree so that we do not have the opportunity to amend contribute or correct They bring us a law that on the one hand proposes the improvement of the conditions of domestic workers but on the other discourages their recruitment and encourages the submerged economy seriously damaging Frankly we do not know whether what they intended under this law was for women to stay at home because they were unable to pay for help or for many domestic workers to be left out of work or to end up working without a contract simply because of the need of one or the other Ladies and gentlemen you are full of people talking about women 's rights but with this way of legislating or defending working mothers or domestic workers and look you do not even defend immigrants because the vast majority of domestic workers are legal immigrant women who have left it all behind to build a future among us who work very hard to live decently and be able to send money to their families and who have made a gap between us on the basis of a great deal of effort Ladies and gentlemen do you know what 's going on That you can't legislate on matters that belong to families when you hate our families you can't make a law to improve the working conditions of housewives when you want there to be no homes to work in That 's what happens to you What happens to you is that you hate our families especially if they are numerous because only from the hatred of families in general and the many in particular and only from the prejudice that all families who hire help at home are rich can you make a law like this at a time like this with inflation triggered with the shopping basket fired with fuel fired with light and gas fired Moreover they were fired not by war nor by the pandemic no they were fired by their fault alone and exclusively by their fault and by their disastrous policies Do they not realize that all our families have it much harder today that there are families that have it even worse because they have more mouths to feed families whose homes are much harder to maintain because their expenses multiply exponentially How can they claim that families who already take care of their household employees social security benefits almost as if they were businesses also take care of 20 of the costs of unemployment contributions and FOGASA And worse how can large families which I remind them that they are no longer the only ones with many children thus be harmed by removing the 45 bonus guaranteed by article 9 of the Law on the Protection of Large Families What need did they have to repeal this article What better way do we have to spend our tax money than by guaranteeing our workers rights What better way to spend it than by helping our families so that they can work and reconcile This ladies and gentlemen is a dirty move one of these dirty moves that you so much like to force the parliamentary groups in this House to have to decide who they want more whether Dad or Mom to force the groups in this House to choose who we have to leave at the stand who we prefer to harm whether the domestic workers leaving them in the precarious work they now live in or the large families who are the ones who make the most effort to get their own people out of the way who bear the most costs who contribute the most to our system who have the greatest need for reconciliation and who now want to force them to meet property or income requirements to qualify for a bonus which they have not even had the decency to tell us how they are going to implement and who are absolutely unfair But of course this is a usual practice its Machiavellian and twisted way of acting mixing matters to confuse the citizens and to throw us in the face afterwards as they do in every intervention repeating as trained parrots the cutting of matters to which we have voted but not obviating that they made us choose between a greater and a lesser evil It is clear to us what you want you want confrontation because you live from confrontation and now it is up to us to confront the large families because you know that we cannot vote against this right and leave a group that deserves and needs them without rights What you want is to end the traditional family and especially the numerous families because for you are the cradle of the values you are wishing to liquidate,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,37.404118,4.916856,23,thank president good morning ladies gentlemen ladies

#RafaelFernándezLomanaGutiérrez,Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen today is a sad day for Spanish sport a sad day because it is going to pass the worst Sport Law in the history of democracy in this country Although today we must vote on the changes introduced by the Senate they will allow me to emphasize our frontal rejection of the bill that is expected to emerge from this House The Sport Bill was originally proposed as a tool to meet the current needs of the sport sector since the current law dates back to 1990 A new Sport Law that was certainly necessary and was thus being requested by the different actors of the sport However instead of attending to your needs and requests you have perverted the Law of Sport using it for your purposes and those of your partners and friends It has been developed with a harmful legislative technique and with clear and numerous shortcomings as the experts have denounced It turned out that what was behind were the European funds and hence the haste to carry out the project was whatever it was without taking into account the real needs and voice of the sporting world They could n't have done any worse They have introduced gender ideology and the 2030 Agenda into the world of sport incredible and disappointing They have left the Administrative Court of Sport the TAD almost without competence sticking to the wishes of certain sports federations for which the court was annoyed a total irresponsibility Let me put it this way they 've taken it out of the way They have eliminated the possibility that clubs and sportsmen can appeal to the Administrative Court of Sport the sanctions imposed by sports federations and have done so without giving the slightest explanation because of course it is difficult to explain to citizens that they are going to leave clubs and sportsmen helpless while giving more power to sports federations It is for the Higher Sports Council to have the power to sanction directly the presidents of the sports federations or rather the power to sanction them because to date it has been a rule to place complaints against the federative leaders in a drawer and look elsewhere With this law you increase the power of the Higher Sports Council to continue to do so They have also allowed autonomous sports teams to compete internationally at the official level a new concession to the independence and separatist parties I remind you that FIFA and UEFA at the time rejected the formal request made by the Basque Football Federation in December 2020 for full membership in both bodies On the other hand and this is serious they have left absolutely unprotected women sportsmen because in parallel they have processed the trans law law that allows to change sex in the Civil Registry so that a man can count as a woman and participate in women 's sports competitions Make it very clear We are seeing that in Spain because of the trans autonomic laws adopted by you some men are robbing women of their place in sport their titles their podiums and their prizes Specifically the pichichi of the Madrid Women 's League is a 37 year old male who identifies himself as a woman For him to compete in the women 's league gentlemen of the PSOE a woman has had to stay out but it seems that no one neither do you cares this fact They are playing with the effort constancy discipline and illusions of girls adolescents and women who see sport as a philosophy of life All of this could have been saved as proposed by VOX by ensuring that when sports competitions were for sex real sex biological sex was taken care of However inexplicably all the groups the PP and absolutely all less Citizens who abstained voted against Let 's get this straight VOX has stood alone defending women 's sport And not enough with all this we have learned from the State 's Official Gazette that the Council of Ministers at the request of the Minister of Culture and Sport Don Miquel Iceta whom I do not see recently adopted a real decree granting a grant of EUR 1 million to the Youth Sport Foundation for the development of an updated model of Spanish sport a foundation belonging to the Higher Sports Council itself once the draft Sports Law has been approved In other words do I first approve the regulatory law of a sector and then commission a study on what model should be reflected in that law This ladies and gentlemen is unheard of and a veritable waste of public revenue Gentlemen of the Government cancel this subsidy because it is an amount intended for useless work when the law is already being passed and is therefore an absolute expense EUR 1 million to be earmarked for other purposes In their consciences they will have been the creators of the worst Sports Law of our democracy a law they have used to put their propaganda and content their partners rather than watch over the sports sector A law that removes powers from the Administrative Court of Sport,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,31.9847,7.3458023,23,thank president ladies gentlemen today sad day spanish sport sad day going pass worst sport law history democracy country although today

#MaríaDeLosReyesRomeroVilches,Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen in VOX we are fully committed to the challenge that Spanish society faces of getting as close as possible to a scenario where general accessibility is a universal right Within this accessibility one particularly important aspect in which we have an obligation to move forward is of course cognitive accessibility We understand for this the quality that messages of any kind that are displayed in the public or social sphere must meet so that all people or at least most of them can understand them easily It is clear that such cognitive accessibility is key to the effective exercise of certain rights such as the right to health the right to education employment culture mobility and even political rights such as the right to vote We also see how the scope of cognitive accessibility goes beyond people with disabilities We live in a very complex world where social and technological changes are accelerating in a truly dizzying way This is causing a deep rift between those who have access to information for example because of the ability to handle digital or technological tools and those who have left behind either because they are of a certain age because they live in rural or disadvantaged areas or because of some social circumstance as we say outside of disability itself In VOX we welcome the will of consensus that all parties have expressed on an issue that should not be faced and that largely responds to the demands expressed by civil society We are hearing the messages from all parties in this House and indeed they all say they are in favour of inclusion and of removing to the extent possible the physical or moral barriers that hinder the free development of personality Who can disagree with this But I have to remind you that all of you I insist all of you agree on one issue All of you agree to help people with disabilities except that they are in the mother 's womb because then all of you are willing to apply the death penalty to them for the simple fact of being in the mother 's womb We must also denounce the fact that in the process of this initiative there has been a real boycott of VOX 's proposals with the undisguised desire to exclude our participation in this legislative process But yes we have been warned as active and passive that we had to join the consensus the consensus of all of you in order to guarantee this initiative a perfect example of hypocrisy and sectarianism which unfortunately abound in this House We would have liked to have accepted some of the proposals made by the VOX Parliamentary Group but here we have heard from this rostrum this morning Mr Ramos Esteban say that VOX must be silenced Look ladies and gentlemen in case you have n't heard VOX as bad as it is for all of you is today the third political force and continues to rise so the sooner you assume it the better it will be for everyone With our proposals we tried to improve expressions that pay the toll corresponding to the connoisseurs ideological delusions of the parties progress which are all you It may give them the same but we believe it is important to avoid redundancy and subject language to the rules of linguistic correction that the Royal Spanish Academy marks Focusing already on a more substantial point of view and talking about issues that should really also be of concern to you we understand that many of the specific measures imposed on both public and private sector companies can be excessively burdensome We cannot forget the context of a serious energy and economic crisis that is going through all our productive sectors Therefore incentives and financial aid should have been provided to make it possible for entities to comply with legal requirements For the same reason it would also have been appropriate to revise the sanctioning regime provided for in Title III of the consolidated text We also believe that a procedure should have been allowed to grant aid to local authorities given their limited financial margin to meet the economic requirements arising from compliance with the accessibility rules and their proper coordination with the rest of the territorial administrations Ladies and gentlemen I am convinced that there is not a single company that does not agree with improving cognitive accessibility for people who need it but it cannot be legislated in abstract form without taking into account the sociological reality in which we have to apply the rule Because ladies and gentlemen no one with common sense can understand that an Equality Minister is going to spend EUR 20 319 million on gender policies in what you call equality policies And meanwhile the Spanish families are still stifled by the serious crisis we are experiencing Let 's see what equality you 're talking about Ladies and gentlemen VOX is a serious party and we are aware of our responsibility so we are going to face the challenge of cognitive accessibility without incurring party considerations always thinking about the best for society as a whole That is why I do not want to end without remembering once again that VOX is the only party that defends the dignity of all people regardless of their capacities within and outside the mother 's womb The main right of people is the right to life and in this as in so many other issues let me tell you that there is only VOX left,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,36.888786,4.9475026,23,thank madam president ladies gentlemen vox fully committed challenge spanish

#JoséMaríaSánchezGarcía,Thank you With the venom Mrs. Moro Almaraz yesterday Mrs. Pastor came down from the co-governance donkey Sánchez 's interested fantasy after more than a year in which you have been talking about her in terms of unwavering adherence You starting with Mr. Married and following Mrs. Cuca But fortunately that accession has broken and then I think I can see that our teachings against that pilgrim ideation have not been in vain Now you insist again on the law of pandemics which is like a nervous tic of Mr. Married that you repeat I tell you with the utmost affection what striped record and that we have to amend by opposing that point four of your motion Everything you say about doctrinal and jurisprudential authorities is not true nor is your quotation distorted by the opinion of the Council of State you have quoted I will read to you what the judgment of the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of 14 September 2021 says The normative coverage of the measures that the health authorities consider urgent and necessary for public health and imply limitation or restriction of fundamental rights is found in the health legislation in particular in the Organic Law 3/1986 on Special Measures in the Field of Public Health in the General Law on Health and in the General Law on Public Health You should be aware of this sentence and your group as well and you should stop changing the name of that ridiculous plan B that all you intended was to reform a line of one paragraph of an article of a law with purely exploratory scope for this now megalomaniac pretentious and crazy pandemic law name Moreover for this group it is somewhat inconclusive that Sánchez is a despot a despot in the sense of Tocqueville who says of the despot that he is the one who while considering the excellence of freedom only wants it for himself Or in more classic terms if you want he is a tyrant in Plato 's terms in his Gorgias dialogue Since someone has to rule the city either acts tyrannically or on the contrary is a follower of the legitimate constitution This is Sanchez But Sánchez 's attacks which as you have said are concentrated in less than a year and have given rise to five rulings by the Constitutional Court that leave him in this ignominious figure of the despot or tyrant are ways that his party fights timidly and partially without conviction Only the determination of VOX has succeeded in discrediting them through the above mentioned rulings of the Constitutional Court However today we propose to approve a motion that relates to and complains about such abuses and abuses and you reproach yourselves in reciprocity with the Socialist Party that of the election of the members of the General Council of the Judiciary or of its blockade that of your mismanagement in the matter of the health crisis or of the lack of cooperation that the PSOE reproaches you in an extraordinary situation that of the prison policies that the PSOE practices while being led by the Government by Sánchez and that you says the Socialist Party and rightly so which you also practiced in the governments that you led etc All these accusations and mutual reproaches are circumstantial and contingent because the substantive reality is very different it is another The substantive reality is that you agree on the issues of Spanish politics and you do so despite the fact that it is a convergence that has cost you 5 800 000 votes since 2011 and 4 400 000 votes since 2008 to the Socialist Party You have lost 50 of your electoral balance and the Socialist Party has lost 40 However they are recalcitrant they do not react they are slaves to that 2030 Agenda which is an affront to all Spaniards because the only thing they pursue is because of ideological objectives the depopulation of the nation In addition you have practiced during the government of Mariano Rajoy the same fiscal policy that Mr Sánchez has practiced since 2019 to lower growth greater fiscal effort It is a disappointment that it is not in the head except of inepts who are what you are as you have just recently remembered the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 22 January

#GeorginaTríasGil,Thank you Mr. President Madam Minister ladies and gentlemen stop talking about equity because there is no equity in the Spanish education system as we have repeated many times The transfer of education competence to the autonomous communities means that we are currently talking only about about 6 of all that is invested in education in Spain The Ministry of Education is perhaps one of the most representative entities in terms of educational management and as the years progress inequality increases It is unjustifiable that the investment is up to 60 higher in some autonomous communities or that at the beginning of the most expensive course for inflation triggered which also affects books school materials and uniforms textbooks are still funded in some communities yes and others not when with half of the budget of the Ministry of Equality all this expenditure in primary school could be covered But these budgets also deepen the inequality of knowledge as they do not allocate a single resource to ensure something as elementary as schooling in Spanish throughout the national territory because with the competence of transferred education the Government disagrees and does not even act when it has a small margin Because why does it not activate compensation mechanisms through cohesion funds to correct the inequalities generated by the autonomous system Actually minister it does n't matter what we talk about because you also in the educational sector are focused on resilience skills gender climate green transformation and mudOS of the 2030 Agenda because for you ensuring that everyone knows our common language and history access to university is fair for everyone or the freedom of parents to educate their children according to your convictions are minor issues on which you do not consider investing resources In fact the only thing his Government assures is indoctrination for all Moreover with these budgets once again the most vulnerable and least resourced remain abandoned by his Government Their mouths are filled and they are used for inclusive education when in VOX we do not stop meeting with families with children with special educational needs absolutely underserved and victims of legislation that are made without thinking about their beneficiaries and their families So please do not say as they say that budgets have the focus on people and attention to the well being of education Because when you talk about the well being of education you are distorting the reality of our students and young people by selling them the idea that their well being passes by living comfortably and effortlessly and to be able subsidized Let the children go happy to school something legitimate that we all want for our children has nothing to do with what you are converting it and where the budget headings go a kind of theme park that forgets that the essentials of the school is the transmission and acquisition of knowledge Minister you have forgotten that it is in that process in that of the transmission of knowledge when the formation of the person comes into play and with it many variables emotional is one but it is not the only one that contribute to forging character formation that should aim at a successful life Education any good teacher knows is a balance between knowledge effort motivation emotion frustration overcoming joy the acquisition of habits and virtues The problem of this Government of this legislation of these budgets is that they turn peripheral issues into central issues relying on competitive learning that vague and diffuse concept that they use for everything and that nobody really knows what it is that jargon that even the RAE academics do not accept as they recently indicated in an information note on the new selectivity And he quoted the RAE the ministerial text reiterated in several sections the importance of teaching and evaluating in a competitive way but it does not clarify exactly what competencies are supposed to be essential nor does it explain why their acquisition should be opposed to the knowledge of the contents that have so far been considered essential And there 's nothing you can do right They initiate a reform of selectivity and instead of going to the essentials which is a unique selectivity for all Spaniards what they do are experiments and turn for example the Castilian Language test into something similar to a self school test Finally with regard to the quality of education the great novelty that they bring us in these budgets you say is to bet heavily on the digital support of the system which in fact is a bet for indiscriminate hasty and unseen digitisation of needs for a system that is already devalued and that is simply to throw away public money These budgets are a renunciation of education as a social lift Who do companies hire in the coming years if we have not asked our young people for minimums in reading reflection argumentation operations mathematics writing skills Not to mention the industrial fabric because at least the fate of the huge investment in Vocational Training more than EUR 2 billion should be reconsidered when in parallel we see no part to enhance the reindustrialisation of Spain Nor do we see a determined impulse to tackle school drop out in a general way where Spain unfortunately remains at the head of Europe It is urgent Minister to focus on the important What is it going to do for many in the ESO or for them to approve selectivity if they do not know how to read an instruction manual if they do not hold three pages in a row of reading And what will happen to so many students in public school who without mercy are inoculated degenerate ideology when what they need is along with knowledge rapport family and stability Who 's going to give hope to those students and those families Minister to form free men and women we must aim at the good and the truth the merit the value of the effort the work the excellence of the faculty and to renounce all sectarian and destructive ideologies to stop investing millions for cross-sectional education with gender ideology to stop investing millions to erase our history from the memory of our young people in the name of democratic memory to stop investing millions to encourage children and young people to doubt their identity and fearlessly change their sex to stop investing millions to approve everyone for ever less knowing to stop investing millions for inclusive education that ends with special education to stop investing millions to

#GeorginaTríasGil,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Here we are once again defending something that the Spaniards in normal circumstances in a normal country should not claim something as elementary and as common sense as the defense of the right to education in Spanish in any corner of our nation Let 's start by remembering the obvious One Catalans are Spanish as are Galicians Asturians Valencians Basques Mallorcans Andalusians Castilanoleans Two The common language of all Spaniards is Spanish Three According to the Constitution all Spaniards have the right and duty to know Spanish For this reason any family that wants to be able to school their children in Spanish must be able to do so and the State must guarantee this essential right of every Spanish resident It is not normal that in order to achieve schooling in Spanish in Catalonia it is necessary to go through a crossroad of demands and judgments which unfortunately are not fulfilled precisely because the Government of the Generality supported by the Social Communist Government of Pedro Sánchez invites systematic disobedience through autonomous laws and decrees that impose Catalan to the detriment of Spanish and which by the way we have recently appealed to the Constitutional Court In Catalonia there is not a single public centre to study in Spanish If anyone wants to get it they have to pay Says a father He paid 10,000 euros for my children to study in Spanish It was the only way out that left him in the face of harassment and toppling that his two children were suffering every day Or the father of the daughter of Canet who explains to us Up to fifteen families in school were interested in claiming their own children 's right to education in Castilian but they all ended up giving up Some preferred to save themselves problems or reproaches from their neighbors and acquaintances others worked in the Administration and feared consequences and some even recognized that they were afraid They were left alone Loneliness abandonment and defencelessness far removed from the linguistic cordiality of which Feijóo is famous In fact in Catalonia the course has begun with a totalitarian campaign against children who speak Spanish in the courtyards of Catalan schools and language commissioners are expected to be present in these areas It is irresponsible and can be offensive to speak as Mr Feijóo does of moderation serenity centrality and even linguistic cordiality when the reality that thousands of Spaniards live is of linguistic oppression In Valencia a music teacher with thirty five years of professional practice is fired for not knowing the Valencian or some parents have to report to the teacher who tells her daughter that she will lower her grade if she does homework or exams in Spanish The new Basque education law proposes Basque as the central axis of education with the approval of the PSOE of course In Asturias the People 's Party supports a PSOE motion to grant job privileges to those who know the invention of language Baleares follows the steps of Catalonia and no public school there will apply 25 in Spanish In Galicia ruled until a few months ago by Alberto Núñez Feijóo teachers are forbidden communications in Spanish access to the Public Service is discriminated against on the grounds of language and the only official form of toponyms is in Galician among other things Just last Sunday at the call in Barcelona for the School of All we were supporting the Catalans who are suffering the most who see their most elementary rights trampled because they do not have the right to school their children in their mother tongue which is also the official language of the Spanish and the official language of the State Also along with thousands of people we went to the tents of Spoken Spanish in fourteen cities and in autonomous communities where the right to school children in Spanish is violated It was a new sign of hope Regrettably however the fruit that this may bear in a Catalonia that has been making steady progress for forty years to break Spain with successive governments of the nation making divestitures of the various separatist governments is very weak That is why today once again we call for the application of Article 155 in a lasting and sustained way over time so that it restores legality in a definitive and effective way in Catalonia and guarantees the rights and freedoms of all Catalans who are trampled on today such as the right to education in freedom and in Spanish The Government of the Generality has taken over the institutions with the complicity of the Government and intends to go beyond the laws and the Constitution above coexistence and respect for court judgements We call for support from all parliamentary groups and in particular a leap of courage to the People 's Party which every time we propose the application of Article 155 which is the only effective constitutional measure to preserve the fundamental rights of Catalans is to propose at best an amendment abolishing the application of this Article Article 155 ladies and gentlemen is precisely a valuable tool that gives us the Constitution to correct cases of rebellion such as the one perpetrated by the Government of the Generality All of you recognize that the language is being used as a political weapon of separatism in Spain to divide us Spanish into something that keeps us united which is the language not only within Spain but with millions of Spanish speakers all over the world We live in a kind of reverse world where our main heritage is dilapidated and despised which is the language that unites us Let us not forget that this is not an exclusive problem of Catalonia and comes from the linguistic policies of the different autonomous communities with co-official language which by the way pushed the People 's Party Balearics Galicia and therefore affects us all the Spaniards who want to reside or move through any of our autonomous communities It 's very worrying that many people are following the trail",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,33.08174,1.1259509,23,"good

#GeorginaTríasGil,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen A unique public and secular school That is the dream of Podemos that crystallizes in what we propose today which is basically to stay with the concerted centers that go wrong and that nobody wants either because they have lost the spirit of the ideal that animated them either because they are on the verge of economic bankruptcy and so appear as their savior By the way gentlemen of Podemos these centers are also public only that in addition to public they are free That is all very far from a serious proposal to improve public education in Spain without objectives without project without adaptation to the times we live with four maximums and forward According to data from the Ministry of Education public education is the one that loses more students in recent years than private and concerted education But we already know that the communists like the fascists know that the way to do things with a nation is first of all by adding to the educational system even if that comes out expensive as is the case because each school that passes to the state costs twice as much to the administration as if it is administered by the concerted Now the situation is more serious In addition to the communist education that fosters one on one education in certain toxic hate poisoned ideologies which lead to moral and economic misery and which disables young people to develop their own thinking we now have the addition of the furious attack on children through an affective sexual education of gender ideology that will leave generations of children not only incapable of long range love which is based on dedication sacrifice generosity selfless donation and whose most beautiful fruit are children but which will leave them absolutely confused about their sexual identity which is one of the members from which personal identity is shaped This bill is full of lies One of them is that it claims to be based on the Spanish Constitution In the explanatory statement public education is confused with education adding freely to the constitutional text article 27.4 of which simply states that basic education is compulsory and free of charge What happens is that once again we can confuse gratuitousness with the state and the public but again we are here to remind you that gratuitousness can be achieved in many ways In the field of education one of them is the concerted school another is the school check which operates in many European countries and is rapidly opening up in the United States Ladies and gentlemen of Podemos in order to legislate in accordance with the Constitution article 27 must be read and interpreted in its entirety without infringing any of the paragraphs that make up it In particular article 27.3 which refers to the right of parents to educate their children according to their own convictions should not be overlooked I wish this were guaranteed by the public school We will all sign for taking our children to the school that is next door to home to a school where our children learn what to learn in school to read write and think through what their teachers teach them in different subjects However the reality is that many families are making a great effort to take their children to other schools that respond to the values and principles with which they want to educate them and in the humblest areas there is more demand Many of these concerted schools are a real oasis in neighbourhoods where life for children and young people is very difficult With this bill aware of the difficult situation in the concerted school We want to give all kinds of facilities for them to give up their educational projects and quickly take advantage of those schools in crisis But let 's see what the parties involved say the representatives of the concerted school I hope that no concerted school will become public says Meritxell Ruiz secretary general of the Christian School of Catalonia Luis Centeno secretary general of Catholic Schools who joins 2000 centres and 1,200 000 pupils says We can not stop harassing the concerted one The LOMLOU is short and they want to take advantage of the last year of government to encourage public concerted confrontation a drama for our educational system To Alfonso Aguiló president of CECE the text of Podemos reminds him of the nationalization plans that have been so common in authoritarian regimes Instead of financing the concerted they prefer to suffocate it and then absorb it at a balance price On the basis of public money he says they want to reduce plurality in school and that in addition to being unfair is a step backwards in rights In the light of these statements it is clear that this proposal for a law does not at all form part of the social consensus since they have not even spoken to the affected party which is the one that supposedly would want to be integrated voluntarily what a perverse euphemism into the public network In fact there are institutions run by families professionals or other religious congregations that can assume schools and also some bishops would be disposed through diocesan schools Just take off the phone and if the educational administrations want to do something offer help so that these other options can be viable This measure is not going to achieve a more free tolerant and cohesive society at all as they say in the text of the bill but more social confrontations and I doubt that even the Socialist Group voted in favour In VOX what hurts us is that they are precisely the humblest and simplest Spaniards the most harmed by initiatives like this Our dream is a public school of quality devoid of any ideology with teachers and teachers with vocation busy in transmitting knowledge to make their students more free and to ensure that the education they receive is truly a social lift Teachers who transmit passion and love for knowledge and truth the basis on which students can build their freedom and make their nation prosperous I wish we had a public school where vulnerable families did not have to give up educating their children in their most intimate beliefs a public school

fact this reality accounts for 10 of the total Spanish households If we go to the latest updated data available to us we find that in 2020 according to the National Institute of Statistics there are a total of 1,944,800 single parent households in Spain Faced with the manipulations that some groups have again poured on our formation during the debate of this parliamentary initiative listen to me well ladies and gentlemen because you have to give it all very chewed single parent families are families and as such have to be protected by the protection provided for in Article 39 of the Spanish Constitution when it provides for the obligation of the public authorities to ensure the social economic and legal protection of families The proposal for a law which we are debating today addresses a problem claimed by single parents in Spain in the light of the situation of obvious inequality in which children who only have a father or a mother under the current regulation of the system of paternity and maternity leave by childbirth or adoption because the current regulation establishing both the Workers Statute and the Basic Staff Regulations is the truth that ignores the peculiarities of single parents families At present both legislative texts recognize the right of the father and mother where both exist to a leave of sixteen weeks after delivery or adoption six of which must be immediately after these two moments allowing the remaining weeks to be requested by the parents in succession This situation leads us as I have indicated to a situation of obvious inequality from the moment when the minor child who after childbirth or adoption has only one of our parents can enjoy his or her dedication and care after the weeks following the birth for a total of sixteen weeks compared to the twenty six weeks enjoyed by the children who have his or her father and mother with them which puts single parents in a clear situation of disadvantage compared to the minor who does have both parents The best interests of the child require that both situations be matched by justice equity and constitutional mandate because this is also provided for in article 39 of our fundamental text in its second paragraph which I mentioned earlier when it points out the obligation of the public authorities to ensure the full protection of children equal before the law regardless of their filiation In this case it has been the courts as previously pointed out that have been before the legislator since the judgement of 6 October 2020 of the TSJ of the Basque Country the Chamber of Social Affairs in which the right of a single parent mother to enjoy the extended permit which would have corresponded to the two parents if they were to have them has been recognized for the first time for the minor children who gave rise to the request But it is necessary not to force our judges to act as legislators We therefore anticipate that this parliamentary group of course will support the adoption of the bill that has been registered by the People 's Parliamentary Group However limiting the protection of single parent families to this extension of maternity or paternity leave by childbirth or adoption is clearly insufficient That is why we also announce that we will proceed with the improvement and refinement of the text during the process of amendments As mentioned above there are almost 2 million single parent families eight out of ten headed by mothers by women This objective fact should not however lead us to fall into the terminological ignorance which is usual on the left which proposes the replacement of the term single parent family by single parent family or grandparent family when the adult in charge of the minor children is the mother And this is because this terminological error comes from considering that single parent has its origin as a father when the parent does come from a relative which of course can include a father or a mother This terminological ignorance of which the representative of Podemos has again demonstrated today to whom by the way we have seen tremendously revolutionary displaying their flags Who was a member of the Government of Spain in order to divide and bring down the Government that has unilaterally changed Spain 's position on Western Sahara We also need to bear in mind that we must reject the discriminatory exclusion advocated by some groups when identifying single parents exclusively with single mothers and advocating exclusive protection from single mothers because it is clear that a single mother living with her partner with whom she has children in common is not a single parent In fact if this confusion and equality were allowed it would turn out that of the nearly 2 million single parent families that we had in Spain in 2020 the largest group would be excluded which are the widows 724,100 single parent families in which because of the marital status of the parent they are widows We will improve the text they have submitted by means of amendments because it is clear that single parent families according to statistical data are in a situation of greater vulnerability and more difficult access to reconciliation of work and family life It is also clear that limiting the rule to extend the permit to twenty six weeks leads the father or mother who enjoys it to a situation of possible and actual exclusion from employability because not all companies can take charge of a leave for twenty six weeks of the same person The most important thing ladies and gentlemen is that this initiative again does not represent a decisive commitment to the protection of families The objective is that in Spain we allocate only 1.3 of GDP to the social protection of families and children The family is the absolute basis of society prior to the State Strong families make strong societies without families there will be no nation there will be no Spain And the solution to this demographic desert that you all of you have imposed on Spain is not illegal immigration which leads to a population replacement and the disappearance of the nation but the protection of the family and the promotion of birth because 47 million Moroccans in Spain do not make Spain do Morocco The reality is that today in Spain it is a real rebellion to defend the family because its policies contract to a criminalization of one of the two members that are essential for the youngest children especially the father I do n't want to be like my dad when I 'm older This poster could pass through one of you in an institutional campaign on the day of the so called gender violence but the reality is that it is a poster of the People 's Party and Citizens Party exhibited in the city of Córdoba in

#MacarenaOlonaChoclán,"With venial Mr. President Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon Let me start with a brief context On October 1 2020 as the president pointed out is the date when the one known as the Kitchen Research Commission was set up At that time we had been fighting the pandemic for seven months Outside these privileged walls the Spanish people suffered We had thousands of missing companies thousands of jobs destroyed because this government with the majority support of this House decided to ban working for the Spaniards without approving in parallel a fair compensation plan for all the Spaniards who had been banned from working and bringing bread to their homes Three months of house arrest under an unconstitutional state of alarm according to the High Court thanks to the estimation of VOX 's appeal Not to mention the more than 100,000 Spaniards who have lost their lives throughout this pandemic 100,000 Spaniards who are not recognized as victims by this government but have been hidden and continue to be hidden under unworthy propaganda Well after seven months of deep suffering for the Spanish people we have that the Socialist Party and the United Nations We can use their parliamentary force to reject VOX 's requests for the purpose of setting up in this Congress commissions of inquiry concerning the acquisition of sanitary material During those months more than EUR 1 billion were awarded by way of emergency We asked for a commission of inquiry into the deaths in the homes of elderly people after meeting in this Congress in this House through the president of the bosses of the residences of elderly people who when under the command of Mr. PabloIglesias and the residences of elderly people asked for medicine what they sent to them was morphine And they rejected a commission of inquiry We call for a Commission of Inquiry into the management of the Government during all these months which would have enabled us to draw lessons from the actions carried out and better prepare ourselves for the event that we have to face another emergency tomorrow All of this was prevented by this parliamentary union between the Socialist Party and the United Podemos But what 's more if your interest was to carry out an investigation into something that had nothing to do with the fight against the pandemic which at the time October 2020 we were carrying out why they also refused VOX 's request to carry out a Commission of Inquiry into the illegal financing of the United Nations We can come from narco dictatorships When we were talking about imputing a party to the coalition government No they decided 206 votes in this House that we should carry out a commission of inquiry in an unprecedented way in the history of Spanish parliamentarianism into events that occurred in 2013 and 2014 the one known as Operation Kitchen which had the purpose in an unprecedented way I repeat because it was facts that had allegedly occurred in a past legislature to investigate whether under the government of the Popular Party of Mariano Rajoy reserved funds and other resources of the Ministry of the Interior and other public institutions had been used criminally in order to remove incriminating evidence from the People 's Party and alleged senior leaders in the judicial investigation by the alleged caisse B From that party We have devoted 20 Members and two Members of this House to this for just over a year But it turns out that after embarking on this barren adventure they wanted a controlled blast because when we asked for obviously relevant testimonies in that Commission starting with Mr Villarejo himself Socialist Party and United Podemos opposed VOX had to travel to the prison to gather Mr. Villarejo 's testimony and be able to offer it later on in the Commission of Inquiry That 's the only way we can twist our arm As they have opposed appearing on the Kitchen Soraya Sáenz Commission of Inquiry in Santamaría who was Vice President of the Government under Rajoy 's mandate and the former Director of the National Intelligence Centre Mr. Sanz Roldán As Mrs Dolores Delgado and the prosecutor Ignacio Stampa have opposed the appearance in this House with regard to whom it is now being investigated whether it was tortically removed by its public prosecutor to torpedo precisely the investigation being carried out at the National Court of the known as Operation Kitchen And today we know precisely that an association of prosecutors will bring Dolores Delgado to justice for preventing access to the file of prosecutor Ignacio Stampa The reality is that as VOX said on 1 October 2020 this Commission has been absolutely barbarous for a reason of pure logic and that an investigation was being conducted in parallel for the same facts before the National Court which believe me I who have acceded to the judicial proceedings I have described as a genuine film of terror but it is clear that the most interesting witnesses for the relevance of their testimony when they come to this Parliamentary Commission would refuse to declare because they thus assist their constitutional right of defence It is clear that when we complete the judicial documentation of interest to shed light on these serious facts we would be denied due to the reservation of judicial cases But listen Socialist Party you dare to say in an opinion that there are certain criminal officials here and you point to Mr Mariano Rajoy and Mrs Dolores de Cospedal Ladies and gentlemen of Citizens but how dare you do the same in this House and in this rostrum and now explain to me why you have not mentioned Mrs Soraya Sáenz of Santamaría Why has the investigation and alleged involvement of the National Intelligence Centre in the serious facts being investigated by the National High Court been avoided in this Commission and we too were supposed to be prevented not through a controlled blast We ask you to vote for the particular vote that this group has put forward and that it intends to make improvements so that public resources are not lost again in actions as sterile as this Committee of Inquiry and because moreover the opinion that you are expected to adopt the one promoted by the Socialist Party has a clear unconstitutionality for violation of fundamental rights",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,35.04132,5.5547385,23,"venial mr. president ladies gentlemen good afternoon let start brief context october 1 2020 president pointed date one known kitchen

#VíctorManuelSánchezDelReal,How late they 're giving it to Don Guillermo And look at you having good afternoons bad afternoons and even worse afternoons The truth is I 'm not going to join them because when someone wants to give everything I have empathy with him Even if you 've let go of some coz I 'm already empathized although there are evenings Do n't be afraid to look up because when you take out that citizen display you remind me of this beautiful dome and that folding up there that reminds a beautiful animal that is represented there we all do well and we 're so handsome They remind me of the animal that 's represented there Yeah yeah upstairs do n't you see The window Have you recognized the animal yet Don Guillermo we agree It says in the Constitution The law will regulate the organisation and parliamentary control and this is important of the media dependent on the state Right It 's as easy as that So is there a need for a law Yes the Constitution says so Is Spanish Television regulated Yeah Are they regulated and with parliamentary control which is what I would like to talk about today other means The answer is no no no and forty seven years no Because they are not subject to appearances for example You and I have shared appearances like that of the president of the EFE Agency who comes here almost to tell us that it is not a public medium and that we only pay her losses who come here when they are appointed and for budgets without knowing or how a result account works Gentlemen I would ask you please that when you choose people for important positions at least that you know how to make the first numbers you can do it in a Post It or if not we teach it to you like that minister in two afternoons Do n't worry we have very good people in right wing parliamentary groups to teach them So is the scope of this bill right No doubt he 's fine but he 's a long way to go He 's missing because we 've been celebrating Francoism for forty seven years here In the case of the EFE Agency you lords of the PSOE and also of the PP are taking part in the celebration of an agency founded by a certain Ramon Serrano Suñer the Brother in law You 're letting the EFE Agency work as it worked exactly during the franchise You hate it I know but it's in your interests for the EFE Agency to function as it did during the franchise at the service of the government I am not going to go into the details of when in the Commission a senator from the PSOE made us a proposal to pay tribute to the founding parents of Spanish Broadcasting He asked us to celebrate the founding of Radio Nacional de España in 1937 by Millán Astray and Spanish Television in 1956 by Arias Salgado without forgetting in 1938 the first tests with Telefunken in collaboration with the German Government You really do n't realize what you 're asking us to celebrate And the problem is that for forty seven years of celebrating Francoism and collaboration with Germany in 1938 you have forgotten to apply the Constitution to the EFE Agency and to many media dependent on public money So I 'm going to propose a solution Not only are we going to support this proposal do n't worry but we are going to discuss this law and then we can go into detail We are going to support it so that it can be processed in this Parliament in spite of the scratches it has given us some of them with a couple of lies but they have been tiny scratches because you can't really make big scratches For the fundamental problem there is a very rapid solution that we have already proposed in 2020 We proposed that the Spanish Radio television Control Commission will change its name and role to be a joint control commission for state owned media Cost to the taxpayer zero euros compliance with the Constitution 100 per cent We have not complied with the Constitution for forty seven years and this very afternoon if you would if you would and these others would we could do so I challenge them Do you want to comply with the Constitution yes or no Let 's do it in the next five minutes I challenge them to see if they have democratic courage With regard to the development of the law Mr Guillermo I am not going to give you lessons in liberalism but the law you have proposed is very unliberal we will talk about it we will make amendments to it First of all because you are not talking about what we should be talking about that we think it has to be a great project of what the State has to be dependent on at the service of the Spanish State probably more outward than it was doing inside In its wording I do not tell you that it is bad on the contrary it is well worked we think they focus too much on what there is and we understand that it is better something new plant than trying to build on that dirty ball than there is It is better to be able to build State dependent means reduced to their expression necessary to serve the State not to serve the state of political parties of these gentlemen of these gentlemen and their usual partners That 's what we should be doing and there despite the kicks that citizens hit us you will always have us by your side And by the way since we 're about to apply tomorrow we have a huge chance The minister of propaganda is coming here tomorrow and we 're going to talk to him about this too The message will be very simple gentlemen of the socialist government in collaboration with the quadruple P those who agreed the presidency People 's Party PSOE PNV and Podemos because you have said it very well and you are right not only did you oppose Citizens we too that we are a little bigger at this time than you and that we were also there you agreed to put your dirty hands on Spanish Television while shouting Independence independence independence That 's what you you you and you have done And on top of it they 've got frogs Let 's talk about it and tell the minister tomorrow Get your dirty hands off the information of all the Spaniards And I conclude Don Guillermo I had so much to give him and I have n't given him I had so much to tell him and we will do it in the course of this law but really you stop applying techniques as frank as those that made Serrano Suñer excited at the founding of the EFE Agency Let us control this very afternoon by changing the Spanish Television Control Commission to a public media control committee this very afternoon zero cost to start implementing the constitutional mandate that all public media should be owed to this Parliament to these Courts to give function to their public service and to really control that they serve the Spaniards and not to you to you to you or to you to the quadruple P or to your partners that I do not want or name Thank you so much

#JoséRamírezDelRío,Thank you Madam President A few days ago the Cabildo de Gran Canaria by decision of Podemos and the PSOE vetoed at the III Women and Sport State Congress the specialist in sports law Irene Aguiar using his appearance in the Committee of Culture and Sport of this Congress to justify this veto It is not only an attack on freedom of expression but also an attack on the dignity of the Congress of Deputies itself If what a person holds in a Commission can be used to eliminate it from public life in Spain no one will of course give any testimony other than that which the Government likes in any Commission or anywhere But this gentlemen of the PSOE and Podemos who have perpetrated this matter cannot be called democracy They have introduced in Spain the culture of cancellation and the culture of censorship Aguiar has been vetoed for expressing opinions shared by many historical feminists of the PSOE The fact that they are imposing the criterion of a part of their leaders on the whole country is an obvious sign of sectarianism and is something that sooner than later they will pay very dearly In order to prepare our position before this law we were gathered with a great many sportsmen clubs federations and experts in sports law and the amendments that we tabled moved the concerns of much of the world of sport These amendments revolve around a number of crucial issues First it is necessary to ensure that the participation of people with a male physical constitution does not destroy women 's sport This does not logically mean that trans people cannot compete in sport it means that they cannot achieve a decisive advantage that ends up eliminating that female sport and ends up blurring the boundaries between male and female sport Women 's sport is currently on the rise around the world but it is clear that this Government prefers to sell itself to the delusions and hallucinations of its partners to stay on the couch Some international federations have taken letters on the matter such as that of Swimming after the case of Lia Thomas In this case a person who was ranked number 462 in male swimming became a gold medal in female swimming in the United States After this letters have been taken in the matter to prevent cases such as this from continuing to harm the rights of athletes However many other federations have not done so With this law athletes will be unprotected and in an inequality of conditions that will in many cases lead them to abandon what they have had to fight for In order to avoid this we have tabled various amendments such as the 709 according to which participation in sports competitions when divided by sex must be made according to biological sex No group has supported this amendment I repeat none The group has supported this amendment which is of mere common sense demonstrating that for the defense of women 's sport as for so many things only VOX remains Secondly a relevant case is that of the TAD the Administrative Court of Sport which had allowed free access and quick decisions on many sports issues so that for example the promotion or descent of sports clubs did not have to wait for years for a court ruling When those decisions were taken by the TAD they arrived more or less quickly when they had to wait for a judicial decision as in the case of the Obradoiro they arrived very late and in some cases there was no possibility of amending the damage suffered For this reason sporting cases will flood the courts of our country in the coming years and when the PSOE joins the history books to the socialist parties of Italy or Greece the next government will have to solve a problem like the one you are leaving you today Thirdly the protection of small clubs in the ecosystem of professional leagues and federations The clubs announced their opposition to this law and only one last minute amendment avoided a strike However we believe that the whole of the article can lead to serious discussions in the courts and that that is not to provide security for our sport Fourthly the conditions of athletes and technicians The situation had changed radically over 1990 and we felt that much more attention was needed The Government has referred us to the status of the athlete However we have to say that seeing what happened with the artist 's status applied to droplets since 2018 this was the time to have discussed this matter The amendment that PSOE and PNV have agreed on to Article 44 which opens the door to the participation of autonomous elections in international competitions is another of those occasions when the gentlemen of the PSOE talk with the sovereignty of the Spanish people You have allyed yourselves with those who publicly seek to break Spain Even some who have shared with you other kinds of madness have had to withdraw from support of this law in the face of this savagery The independenceists have done two things in which they have a lot of practice to take the PSOE measures with which to leverage against our country against Spain and to use sport for propaganda purposes This law has given them both and I hope that every mayor and councillor of the PSOE throughout Spain will know that they have been made accomplices of a betrayal By the way gentlemen of Together you know that you are the pagantas of this government because you have given them nothing and in spite of that A sports law is a need that everyone has gathered and if it had been approached in a less sectarian way it could have enjoyed a great deal of support,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,32.16423,7.4232645,23,thank madam president days ago cabildo de gran canaria decision podemos psoe vetoed iii women sport state congress specialist sports

#JoaquínRoblesLópez,Madam President ladies and gentlemen Minister I have to start with Mr Serna Are you sure you 're from Murcia Because if I were from Murcia I would know that those who opposed women 's scholarships are two people expelled from VOX and therefore do not represent our party there in Murcia Let 's see if you were born in another autonomous community As for what you mentioned on personal matters I will tell you that when Mr. Pablo Iglesias insinuated that Ana Botella Mr. Aznar 's wife was there because she was Mr. Aznar 's wife you did not tear your clothes or say anything at all It is that you have very fine skin for your own things and very hard for others Minister as everyone knows universities have several ways of financing firstly academic fees which amount to approximately 25 secondly current transfers from the Government and the autonomous communities in the form of grants or aid granted by the Government without direct consideration thirdly property income income from property ownership fourthly disposal by sale of property fifthly transfers etc The bulk of this income is found in the rates paid by families and in the current transfers of the Government and the autonomous communities and as is natural as is already the case in Spanish public education inequality is the predominant note however much you gentlemen of the sinister strive to come here presenting yourself as champions of equality It turns out that the funding per student and year of a Basque university is 60 higher than that of an extremist or mortian university As always as always the Basque Country is at the head Again and again the different governments of Spain reward the regions that threaten national unity and punish those that remain loyal to this unity and above all according to article 55 of the law of the university system you will ask the autonomous communities to invest 1 of the gross domestic product in university financing It is obvious that those with fiscal benefits and greater economic development will have healthier universities thus deepening their policies in the inequality of the Spanish So do n't come up with stories of equality and equity The underfunded regions like mine Murcia to which I do not know if Mr Serna really belongs are punished in these budgets scanning investments as the CROEM has already denounced,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,33.83294,-1.2588079,23,madam president ladies gentlemen minister start mr serna sure 're murcia murcia would know opposed women 's scholarships two people expelled vox therefore represent party murcia let 's see born another autonomous community mentioned personal matters tell mr. pablo iglesias insinuated ana botella mr. aznar 's wife mr. aznar 's wife tear clothes say anything fine skin things hard others minister everyone knows universities several ways financing firstly academic fees amount approximately 25 secondly current transfers government autonomous communities form grants aid granted government without direct consideration thirdly property income income property ownership fourthly disposal sale property fifthly transfers etc bulk income found rates paid families current transfers government autonomous communities natural already case spanish public education inequality predominant note however much gentlemen sinister strive come presenting champions equality turns funding per student year basque university 60 higher extremist mortian university always always basque country head different governments spain reward regions threaten national unity punish remain loyal unity according article 55 law university system ask autonomous communities invest 1 gross domestic product university financing obvious fiscal benefits greater economic development healthier universities thus deepening policies inequality spanish n't come stories equality equity underfunded regions like mine murcia know mr serna really belongs punished budgets scanning investments croem already denounced
#JoaquínRoblesLópez,"or diverting the planned funds for infrastructure to other autonomous communities We assume that you will have to deduct that 1 of other investments of your own from the autonomous community The budgets of the Ministry of Universities are the ashes of the general budgets and it is the crucial experiment that shows that this social government can operate at a propaganda blow The reality that more and more Spaniards are getting to know is that you who talk about collecting taxes to finance health and education what you do is have collapsed health and a second divisional education where there is no equity and where indoctrination takes precedence over knowledge At the same time that the subsidies for trade unions are increasing that you are raising your wages that you are building a government so populated that you laugh at the Marx brothers quarters or that you invest 590 million in the absurd ineffective and even harmful Ministry of Equality it turns out that the university gives 441 million that is 22 million less than in the past year Above all the UNED budget reduces it by 7.5 million And for greater scorn the only budget items are those devoted to propaganda which increases by 264 propaganda aimed at advertising each and every one of the mantras of the fundamentalist left climate fanaticism gender ideology hysterical memory etc And another common place you 've mentioned is scholarships which say they 're a subjective right which does n't matter the notes Students at the university are allowed to enrol in half of the credits corresponding to a course of study and of this half they have the option of a scholarship approving in the most demanding of cases 65 In other words one student has a scholarship approving three out of ten subjects that constitute a course The demagogic argument you use that this is for equal opportunities to fall by its own weight because in addition you generate comparative grievances that are terrible It turns out that take note a student who belongs to a family of three members who enters 32,967 euros and who approves three of ten subjects has a scholarship but a student who belongs to a family of three members who earns 44 euros more per year is not entitled to a scholarship even if he approves all subjects Fairness fairness in the distribution of scholarships There is a fundamental reason why this social government may decide to consider scholarships as a subjective right and to absurdly lower academic criteria and this reason is the result of its crude and disastrous ideology For you the university is an end in itself and not a means to work out a professional future or for research They 've turned certain faculties into sinister activist training centers There are faculties in which it is difficult to discern whether one is in an educational center or in a headquarters in Podemos If it was quite common to meet high school students with their scarapela and tambourine singing the Clavelitos already at forty forty years old now what we see are not tunas but tunates who are dedicated to making scrapes who disguise themselves as poor and who instead of the tambourine and the Clavelitos carry the dog the flute and the Bella Ciao but still are social parasites at the service of governmental ideology I 'm going to finish because I do n't have time Mr. Serna has taken a lot away from me You do not welcome the fact that we are not making partial amendments because we do not like to work Look the amendments aim to fix some aspects of a law clean or enhance those that are right and modify those that are wrong That is why it is good that I remind you of a Lao Tse ruling which is immediately applicable to these budgets of ruin and in general to all the ideological laws with which you have punished us in this legislature Lao Tse says you can't clean a wall made of manure the wall we tear down Thank you very

#JoaquínRoblesLópez,President ladies and gentlemen Minister you see that when the independence and separatist groups want to improve a national law it is precisely in order to further deepen their quest for independence you know who the rooms are playing with You will know that the university is a Latin rooted concept that points to what is universal precisely that is why it is called university and not particularity that has its core in Greek schools in Aristotelian high school or in the Platonic academy and as a matter of essence it is basically the search for truth this search for truth that the Greeks called philosophy the search for knowledge These schools also developed during the Roman period the Proculletana and Sabinian schools of Roman law Sabiniana has nothing to do with the racist and xenophobic founder of the Basque Nationalist Party and not with Joaquín Sabina And then the universalizing explosion of medieval universities led by scholastics the University of Paris the University of Salamanca the University of Coimbra to the present universities especially the Anglo Saxons where the most innovative sciences and technologies are studied Universities have historically deployed an essence a nucleus that is the search I insist for truth but the Spanish university has long dragged a degeneration of this essence that within the limit to which this harmful law contributes produces a transformation of that universal essence of truth itself into a different genre of ideological and particularist character Endogamy the lack of means the devaluation of content the gross pragmatism and fundamentally ideology have been the causal agents of this degeneration which has led to the absence of any Spanish university among the best in the world With this law the transformation of the universal in particular is already almost irreversible the conversion of the university into another instrument for the implementation of an official ideology that instead of defending itself dialectically against others is canonized in the legislative texts and uses extortion insult and slavery as the only form of defense The ideology of the fundamentalist left with its climate fanaticism its feminism and contradictoryly to that feminism the theories of gender its inclusive language its political correctness its puritanism combined with contempt for effort study authority and academic excellence replace the truth and cancel the debate Thus this law no longer guarantees the right to education When students call a strike or rather a parody of a strike of those that their subsidized associations promote when they do not govern you will they have students who want to go to class right to be able to enter Because what comes out of the law does n't seem to be By the same rule they award scholarships to mediocre students who only approve 25 of the credits you want to ensure a perfect activist factory An ideology yours that no longer seeks the truth but supports the power of elites who seek to end the canonical nations and turn citizens into subjects of a new order supposedly progressive and in rigor completely regressive Because the model you are pursuing separatist gentlemen is a neo -feudal model and that has nothing advanced In their search for universality medieval universities for example used Latin as a free language which allowed interconnection between them which allowed a Spanish scholastic such as Juan Caramuel to defeat Descartes because Descartes had written his metaphysical meditations in Latin and Caramuel understood it perfectly After the French Revolution and the emergence of political nations with their national languages English and Spanish maintained this universality that frank language character that allowed the development of research programs in two connected areas the Angloosphere and the Spanishosphere remnants of the empires that make up our contemporary world When with this law the separatist social government intends to break the already precarious unity of the single university district encouraging classes publications research to be done exclusively in the regional languages are they not attacking the same universality that the university defends Are n't they using college to break up with what 's common to propitiate the breakup Is it not a new attack on the university district that from this law it is the autonomous communities that set the prices of academic fees And how do you rate that with this law labor personnel are allowed to take the position of rector All the reforms contained in this law are aimed at weakening the university system Undoubtedly as is already the case in Hispano America with propaganda for pre-Columbian languages this linguistic apartheid of Spanish is an instrument for breaking the Hispanicity of our transatlantic ties but also for breaking our nation With this panorama I would ask you to make an effort of coherence and at least to stop calling university what is no longer universal but a ram of the promotion of particularism of villageism and of the disappearance of Spain as a political nation In the logic of preaching affirmative universal propositions have as contradictory proposition the negative particulars Particular and negative is his law they deny the nation deny Spanish deny academic excellence and deny the truth Explain yourself to the Spanish university students of Castilla Aragon Andalusia Extremadura Cantabria or Murcia but also to the Argentine students Peruvians Venezuelans etc. who will not be able to study or work in the Basque Country Galicia Catalonia Valencia or Balearics and will add some more with the bable and these things because you have decided that knowledge truth and universality are less important than the destruction of Spain and the re-conception of the only universal language of our mischievous nation in order to establish a feudal regime in the service of separatist and globalist oligarchies Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,31.839128,-1.1804127,23,president ladies gentlemen minister see independence separatist groups want improve national law

#MercedesJaraMoreno,Good afternoon President Ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to offer our condolences to the family of Sara Gómez who died after a liposculpture I think that talking about cosmetic surgery in a general way leads us to mix concepts and can harm the professional practice of many doctors in Spain On the one hand this sector employs a large number of healthcare professionals so we would have to be extremely careful when talking about them in order not to generalise criminalise or induce suspicions that may harm them On the other hand we must take into account the safety of people undergoing aesthetic treatments This initiative seems well intentioned because it aims to improve the protection of users as well as to combat intrusiveness However in order to assess its scope it would be necessary to know the text of the concrete amendments that are proposed to be incorporated into the text of Royal Decree 1277 2003 or other rules that indicate us in the initiative Thus point 3 of the proposal states that it is intended to amend the Royal Decree establishing the general basis for the authorization of health centres services and facilities This regulatory rule was not enacted to regulate the exercise of the qualified professions since it is a subject reserved in accordance with the rule of law and is intended only to lay down the basic requirements for the authorisation of health centres and establishments Point 4 of the proposal states that it is presented to combat the eradication of any intrusiveness and pseudoscience affecting the various specialties of medical professions The purpose is certainly laudable However it should be noted that there are no plural medical professions since as can be seen from the Law on the Ordination of Sanitary Professions in its article 5 and it has already been written in its day by the Supreme Court the medical profession is one and the medical specialties are a character with which it is exercised The holding of the title of specialist will be necessary for the express use of the designation of specialist for the exercise of the profession with such character and for the occupation of jobs with such name in public and private centres and establishments To combat professional intrusiveness in medicine and in today 's specialty the said law should be amended that is a rule with legal rank We also have to assume that the different medical procedures are statistically subject to various complications such as bleeding infections destabilization of pre-existing pathologies known or not in the patient side effects of the medicines used and other vicissitudes Therefore information to the patient and user is essential for him to assume that he is exposing his health and sometimes his life and to decide freely whether or not to undergo these treatments with full knowledge We must also differentiate the activities undertaken by aesthetic centers in which apparatus is used that have a use in addition to aesthetic sanitary such as laser or pulsed light apparatus They should only be used for uses that the personnel handling them have authorized and never in medical treatments The same applies to parenteral administration of medicines such as hyaluronic acid or botulinum toxin which require the informed consent of the patient as a medical procedure that is and should be administered by an optional With the above clarifications we have made an amendment to improve the information to be provided on healthcare professionals and medical procedures for which they are legally authorized and trained to carry out and thus avoid the intrusiveness of other professionals who are not Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,27.376833,2.5545237,23,good afternoon president ladies gentlemen first would like offer condolences family sara gómez died liposculpture think talking

#MercedesJaraMoreno,Mr President ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to point out that the aim of this Commission was to investigate vaccination in Spain not in Europe or in the rest of the world In addition it had stated objectives from the outset which consisted of analysing among other issues whether high ranking vaccination groups had been jumped of which it is not astonishment here as well as the rest of the objectives A year ago VOX told them that it was not the time to start an investigation when the Spaniards were still in the middle of the pandemic and we had to deal with more practical things for the citizen such as mitigating the queues of hunger raising small businesses that the illegal closure imposed by the government had ruined and caring for and empowering our health professionals At the time it was not that VOX thought that investigating the entire management of the vaccine was not necessary on the contrary but we thought that an investigation by this government was a waste of time because we were not going to know anything and it would only serve for the politicians who govern us to throw flowers at each other as it has been I will explain to the Members who have not been in the Commission and to the Spaniards who listen to me that we have not participated in the Commission because they imposed on us the list of assistants in an undemocratic way without respecting our share of participation and refusing to quote any of the representatives proposed by VOX We had no choice but to stop wavering to the Socialcommunist Left and the nationalists and we stopped being part of this drama that was the Commission After the time of appearance twenty five participants in total and all of similar opinions since for this reason they had been chosen the time came for conclusions and pantomimes of recommendations The conclusions set out in the opinion have given us reason The speech seems to be made by the minister 's cabinet Reading it gives the impression of being in front of the ministry 's vaccination strategy The basic text on which he has worked is that of the PSOE and on this text the rest of the groups made their amendments United We can make an attack on private property price intervention and blaming the pharmaceutical industry The PNV proposed to delete all references to co-governance and to try to delete everything that was Spanish in character They prefer the context of the European Union of Health while the Spaniards spend their lives being cared for by other communities or getting an appointment of specialties Compromís brought an allegory to the NGO Doctors of the World in order to attack the pharmaceutical industry and promote the vaccination system in the countries where they have representation forgetting the rest of the world The Republican Parliamentary Group in a love for work that covers half a leaf spoke of something important such as the side effects of vaccines but lomezclaved with other points and questioned that the first vaccination groups had to be chronically ill From the whole period of amendments came the final text of the Commission 's opinion which varied little from the original except in some small reference here and there to what was amended to satisfy the partners of government However there are different points to highlight from what we are talking about and I insist that in no way meets the objectives of the convention in its constitution First they claim that the actual cost of vaccines is unknown How do you understand this Do n't you know how much they 've paid or how much they owe for the vaccines they 've bought What contracts have you signed Have you signed a blank cheque to the European Union without asking for explanations Why this obscurantism Is this going to be the case for all centralised purchases with the European Union Ladies and gentlemen when paid with public money there can be no confidentiality clauses explanations must be given We demand transparency Another issue to be noted is that at this point any citizen knows that Spain is participating in solidarity vaccination and in the transfer of knowledge However the opinion does not provide any information about how much money you are giving to other countries for this purpose when in Spain you are not taking care of the entrepreneurs you have ruined with the closure of your businesses We would like to know how much money you are giving to other countries and how much you are devoting to the recovery of the Spaniards because after all it is our money that you waste In addition in the case of knowledge transfer it is insulting that the Spanish benefit from the diagnostic test given to C TAPno Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission you have not met any of the objectives No irregularities delays or vaccination failures have been found What a coincidence Nothing is said that the delay in buying vaccines ruined our country 's health and tourism Nothing is said about the lack of concreteness about the responsibilities that can be generated by the adverse effect of vaccines The Government and the European Union are obliged to declare the degree of responsibility of governments and the industry for the adverse effects Nothing is said about the reason why doctors are not allowed to prescribe vaccines Nothing is said about why the vaccine data sheet was skipped to start a heterologous vaccination It should also be noted that the Spanish Government has not given a cent for the development of the vaccines received by the Spanish neither a euro to Pfizer nor a euro to Moderna nor to AstraZeneca but what the parties of the left and separatists are considering is to give money to the cannabis manufacturers flagged by Podemos and his travelling companion in this case the PNV Finally they congratulate themselves on the vaccination I will tell you in this regard that making the possibility of vaccination available to the citizens is only their obligation and it is thanks to the citizenship of the Spaniards that the scope of vaccination in Spain because they have come to be vaccinated and protected in a massive way demonstrating common sense trust in the science and maturity that we have as a society Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,34.540688,5.233531,23,mr president ladies gentlemen

#EduardoLuisRuizNavarro,Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Today we are discussing a bill to reform the Congressional Rules of Procedure which basically aims to control the Government 's compliance with what is agreed on in the GNP and other motions that are passed It turns out that for the PNV this great party of state which is always willing to cut it here it is not urgent that the regulation be amended so that the political plurality that we represent here is real and effective so that for example the third parliamentary group in this House is treated with justice There is nothing going on in front of the cacicada that VOX has been deprived of being present at the tables of all the commissions all of them There has been no democratic decency to respect in this House the order of majority that the Spanish people have established with their votes There is nothing at all about the fact that VOX has been allocated seats by way of irregular and arbitrary distribution through the Chamber while other groups such as the proposer with a small number of Members enjoy privileged locations It does not seem to be a problem either if Members of the third parliamentary group are arbitrarily deprived of their participation in international activities to which this House sends representatives placing in their place Members of groups with much less representation as is the case with whom The PNV Oh my God For the PNV the important thing is that in Congress we lose more time with the PNL and other motions We all know in this House that GNP and motions are nothing but declarations of principle that they are indeed important for deepening the quality of our democracy but that they are not binding and we are not just saying this nor a large part of the liberal sector as the Constitutional Court 's judgment 180/1991 also says And they cannot be binding because the separation of powers proper to a democratic State determines that the essential function of the Legislative Power is to draft laws In short Article 203 bis proposed by the Basque Nationalist Party goes beyond the constitutional function assigned to this House But this is not an obstacle of course for VOX to have brought good non-legislative initiatives to this Parliament such as the one calling on the Government to suspend the granting of visas to nationals of countries who refuse to readmit those who are expelled for illegally entering Spain And it is that we do not have to endure those who violently assault our borders of Ceuta and Melilla recognized by Minister Marlaska and seriously and savagely harm our police officers Or the one calling on the Ministry of Equality to guarantee equality among all Spaniards because men and with us many women are already tired of being pointed out as stinking Or like the one calling for measures to prevent ETA from deciding Spain 's prison policy Because ETA has not only not disappeared it has an influence on politics because you peneuvists and also socialists are very comfortable with it after having bleached it What a shame Of course these initiatives were also rejected with the votes of the PNV But look even assuming they could have been approved by a majority what would they have served For really little by little because you cannot be required to answer to those who do not comply with what is not binding upon them so simple however much you gentlemen of the PNV propose And you yourself Mr. Legarda have recognized him in the rostrum We really are not here to waste time we are here to legislate and to do it right which is our obligation It would therefore have been interesting for his proposal to deal for example with improving the system of drafting laws Because let us see is it acceptable as a parliamentary practice for one or more groups to make amendments outside of a legislative presentation by denying participation to the rest of the groups Or is it acceptable as a parliamentary practice that in some legislative papers they are presented by majority groups in a surprising way and without time for their study massive modifications of the normative texts in progress forcing their vote in addition We do n't think so The question is gentlemen of the PNV whether you as a group linked to the majority that supports the Government recognize yourselves as collaborators in such practices And since we are talking about regulatory changes I ask you have you agreed to encourage the amendment of the Basque Parliament 's Rules of Procedure to ensure ideological plurality and political participation I do n't think so I say this because of the totalitarian deprivation of democratic rights which under the guise of loopholes or voids in your rules of procedure of the regional Parliament you together with your socialist communist and Batasun allies are imposing on our parliamentarian Amaia Martínez whom we admire for her courage and send from here a strong embrace Ladies and gentlemen of the PNV we Members of VOX are not like you We are not afraid to discuss their parliamentary initiatives however absurd some of them may seem to us you see You on the other hand do not dare to do the same with VOX in the Basque Regional Parliament It seems that the brave Gudaris even playing with a great numerical advantage are shaking their legs In short it seems that this time there will be no unanimity We will vote not on your proposal for a law not because we intend to do this illegitimate government the favor you know that it is not but because we only managed to waste all our time even more and we are not for this We cost the Spanish people a lot of money and for that reason they deserve a little more respect from us Nothing more and thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,35.079803,8.2875805,23,good afternoon ladies gentlemen today discussing bill reform congressional rules procedure basically aims control government 's

#IwobiTonyChike,Mr President Minister these days the death of an African citizen at the slum tower Antonacci is reported in Rignano Garganico in the province of Foggia following a fire that has involved the camp which has hosted for years thousands of immigrants engaged mostly in agricultural work and with a significant numerical increase during the harvest season There are more and more cases of slums tendostructures and spontaneous settlements of migrants which host people mainly employed in seasonal agricultural work on the national territory where there is a dramatic inhuman and complete abandonment situation with considerable problems related to the issues of health and public safety as well as the safety of the migrants present These settlements represent a concrete example of the difficulties of management and integration due to the numbers of immigration out of control These places pose risks of public order and health for the surrounding area and risk food for organised crime businesses as well as seriously putting the same safety of guests The labour exploitation of migrants in the agriculture sector is a scourge for our country which generates social insecurity and precariousness and feeds the black economy and organised crime Finally it must be assessed that no restrictions on landings and no serious policies of containment of exceptional migratory flows lead to an overload of the reception system which feeds the bad management of migrants on the Italian territory and the consequent abandonment on the territory of thousands of migrants mostly in the situation of irregularities In our opinion as a solution it is essential to invest in training work and assistance in order to accelerate the consequent process of voluntary returns which is able to bring benefits wealth and development to the country of origin also pursuing the concept of discouraging departures as a pillar of future immigration policies The question Minister asks whether he is aware of the numbers of spontaneous and self managed settlements of migrants present on Italian territory and what initiatives he intends to take in order to manage and put an end to this emerging situation,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,27.909868,7.2047396,23,mr president minister days death african citizen slum tower antonacci reported rignano garganico province foggia following fire involved camp hosted years thousands immigrants engaged mostly agricultural work significant numerical increase harvest season cases slums tendostructures spontaneous settlements migrants host people mainly employed seasonal agricultural work national territory dramatic inhuman complete abandonment situation considerable problems related issues health public safety well safety migrants present settlements represent concrete example difficulties management integration due numbers immigration control places pose risks public order health surrounding area risk food organised crime businesses well seriously putting safety guests labour exploitation migrants agriculture sector scourge country generates social insecurity precariousness feeds black economy organised crime finally must assessed restrictions landings serious policies containment exceptional migratory flows lead overload reception system feeds bad management migrants italian territory consequent abandonment territory thousands migrants mostly situation irregularities opinion solution essential invest training work assistance order accelerate consequent process voluntary returns able bring benefits wealth development country origin also pursuing concept discouraging departures pillar future immigration policies question minister asks whether aware numbers spontaneous self managed settlements migrants present italian territory initiatives intends take order manage put end emerging situation
#BalboniAlberto,"Mr President Minister ladies and gentlemen let me say that if the Rules of Procedure allowed this I would have liked to ask the Minister of Justice about the scandalous decision taken yesterday in France regarding the failure to grant extradition of 10 dangerous terrorists communists and murderers However the timing did not allow it and so I return to the question I had put to the Minister of the Interior about the truly incredible number of landings that we are recording every day on our coasts The Minister in recent days has authorized the docking of as many as five different ships for a total of about 1,000 illegal immigrants who have therefore been authorized to land in our ports The data speak for itself at the same date of 2019 the landings were 2,114 immigrants arrived illegally in 2020 this number was 6,614 in 2021 we reached 19,749 and today Minister we are 26,652 These are really impressive numbers which are not even complete because as we know the ghost landings are not recorded which no one is able to quantify exactly These figures alone show that it was extremely wrong to dismantle the so called security decrees which also in 2019 and 2020 had the results that I referred to You wanted to set up a wide mesh system and that is the effect As if that were not enough Minister a few days ago you made statements without perhaps realizing how much they can contribute to the immigration business In order to summarize with a very effective phrase that used Daniele Capezzzone on The Truth a few days ago you developed a theory that the solution would be more immigrants more cooperatives that is exactly the opposite of what you would need I refer Mrs. Minister to your statements at the Confcooperative Assembly PRESIDENT The debate is The Minister for the Interior Mr Lamorgese has the right to reply to the question which has just been put for three minutes",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,26.951632,6.579656,23,"mr president minister ladies gentlemen let say rules procedure allowed would liked ask minister justice scandalous decision taken yesterday france regarding failure grant extradition 10 dangerous terrorists communists murderers however timing allow return question put minister interior truly incredible number landings recording every day coasts minister recent days authorized docking many five different ships total 1,000 illegal immigrants therefore authorized land ports data speak date 2019 landings 2,114 immigrants arrived illegally 2020 number 6,614 2021 reached 19,749 today minister 26,652 really impressive numbers even complete know ghost landings recorded one able quantify exactly figures alone show extremely wrong dismantle called security decrees also 2019 2020 results referred wanted set wide mesh system effect enough minister days ago made statements without perhaps realizing much contribute immigration business order summarize effective phrase used daniele capezzzone truth days ago developed theory solution would immigrants cooperatives exactly opposite would need refer mrs. minister statements confcooperative assembly president debate minister interior mr lamorgese right reply question put three minutes"
#BalboniAlberto,Mr President Madam Minister I am surprised that you are also able to take into account ghost landings because if they are such no one can know how many they are when they happen and to what extent Congratulations though With regard to the theory of relocation Madam Minister we cannot expect to relocate migrants who arrive on our coasts without being real refugees You know better than I that those who really escape from war persecution who really are entitled to refugee status are at most 10 of those who arrive The other 90 percent are economic refugees as is also shown by the demographic composition they are largely young and strong men unlike Ukraine where 90 percent are women and children who really run away from the war Do you understand Madam Minister the difference The solution is not to help landings it is not NGOs that act as sea taxis for boatmen for human trafficking The solution is to block departures less departures means fewer deaths That 's a statistic Madam Minister The only way to block departures is to ensure that in agreement with the States of origin there is what we call in naval blockade jargon even if it is not really a naval blockade because we do not propose an act of war but an act of peace in agreement with the countries of origin so that asylum applications are made in these countries and at the diplomatic representations of the countries of origin or transit can be submitted applications and screened This is a screening that we should do in any form of relocation however we can get the green light from Europe It is very questionable that European countries accept immigrants who are not entitled to remain on our territory Therefore Madam Minister the solution that Brothers of Italy proposes which I hope the Government will eventually adopt is to ensure that these boats of despair do not leave That is the real objective we must aim for,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,27.090134,6.6754847,23,mr president madam minister surprised also able take account ghost landings one know many happen extent congratulations though regard theory relocation madam minister cannot expect relocate migrants arrive coasts without real refugees know better really escape war persecution really entitled refugee status 10 arrive 90 percent economic refugees also shown demographic composition largely young strong men unlike ukraine 90 percent women children really run away war understand madam minister difference solution help landings ngos act sea taxis boatmen human trafficking solution block departures less departures means fewer deaths 's statistic madam minister way block departures ensure agreement states origin call naval blockade jargon even really naval blockade propose act war act peace agreement countries origin asylum applications made countries diplomatic representations countries origin transit submitted applications screened screening form relocation however get green light europe questionable european countries accept immigrants entitled remain territory therefore madam minister solution brothers italy proposes hope government eventually adopt ensure boats despair leave real objective must aim
