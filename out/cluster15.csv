#CalandriniNicola,Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President I too agree with the thanks of my colleagues to Mr Sartore he has been an exceptional person with whom we have worked very well and we thank you for the intellectual honesty you have always represented in the work of the Commission So thank you Undersecretary for this end of the legislature We do not really appreciate the words spoken by my fellow Members because the only really positive aspect in this settlement in my opinion is indeed what the Undersecretary described namely that we have within this act the 14.3 billion that will be needed for the decree that tomorrow as it would seem will be issued by the Council of Ministers that we hope this time actually goes in the right direction that is to give real support to Italian families and businesses We are talking about an amount that can be as valuable as a budget law On the other hand the report and the adjustment that we are examining and voting on today contain only apparently positive data What we have noticed is that we are in the presence of documents with more revenue than expected We could clearly limit ourselves to sharing them but it is also right to understand where these resources come from The documents today clearly tell us one thing there is an increase in the tax burden ranging from 37.9 to 38.4 percent an additional 0.5 that is not a small thing the usual recipe of the left able to put his hands in the pocket of the Italian taxpayers We must infer that the increase in the tax burden is directly linked to the increase in the Irpef which leads to the fact that the levy on self employed workers and employees is likely to cause this increase in income in the state 's coffers It 's always them in the end who pay Regardless of the fact that increasing taxes is an issue that we never agree with this increase in fiscal pressure cries with the increase in public debt which goes even to 152.6 percent Then we have to think that something does not work it increases taxes and increases the deficit of the state which is among the worst in Europe and comparing it to the rest of the world things are not getting better Then we should ask ourselves how this money is spent because this should be the spirit of the documents we are examining We are certainly not satisfied with this because we must point out once again that for two years now this House and this Parliament have been complicit in the waste we have denounced in all these years of tens of billions of euros resources that were to be used to counter the pandemic and instead have scattered into thousands of relics in unproductive bonuses at best or worse in tips to friends and friends of friends We as Brothers Italy have never been opposed to the increase in debt regardless but we would like to see good debt debt for investments debt for growth debt for transactions that benefit Italian taxpayers We have n't seen any of this in the last two years On the contrary a bad debt has been produced the clear example of this bad debt has given it to the Government that has misspent the state 's money it is all in the 9 billion a year that are allocated on the income of citizenship You see we have not gone crazy we are not opposed to this measure without it but it still appears today as an active labour policy when it was a welfare policy that did not work the way it should have We are not opposed to combating poverty we think that a just state does not put on the same footing who can work and who cannot do it as it does with the income of citizenship Then we give aid and support as Giorgia Meloni says to those who cannot work and we create active labour policies that allow those who are in a position to be employed It is a matter of dignity ladies and gentlemen On the account and on the adjustment there is a question that it is opportune to ask behind the coldness of these numbers can the Government say that it has left a better Italy than it has found it We certainly do not think so because without questioning the authority of Premier Draghi a majority as varied and heterogeneous as the one who claimed it could produce nothing good We have seen timid reforms made only in the name of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan which will unfortunately be transformed on many missed occasions As I said before we have seen billions of euros distributed here and there without being used for long term projects because there has been a lack of a vision of the country a vision that can only have a government with a solid majority with clear ideas and projects consistent with its political history all things that unfortunately were not there in the majority that we are going to leave behind A government that unites everything and the opposite of everything could not go far we have always said so in recent years and the events of the past weeks culminated with the early dissolution of the Chambers are proof that unfortunately we were right You will obviously have to account for all this to the Italian people in a little over forty days time but since you have so far preferred to account only to yourself to your self referentiality our vote on these two measures will only be a vote against,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,17.5615,-8.416389,15,mr calandrini fdi mr president agree thanks colleagues mr sartore exceptional

#CalandriniNicola,Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President with regard to the report before us today we have the same attitude as we have in the past when for example we have approved a series of deviations that have led this country to borrow EUR 200 million Before we go into the substance of the report I would like to make some general comments because today we are adopting a measure which is the first in loose Chambers The proof is that the early end of the legislature is absolutely not leading to the country 's paralysis and the report we are approving today goes in this direction For months it has been said that voting was now irresponsible and many of these accusations have been directed against our political strength which is the only one of opposition It was said in fact that there were the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and various decrees in expiration and that it was necessary to combat inflation the expensive bills the increase in the cost of raw materials and everything that could lead to the increase in prices that there was Imagine if we of Brothers of Italy were not in the front row when we talked about defending and securing our Italy system For months however we were told that nothing could be done with the early vote Today on the other hand in loose chambers and with a government in office only to deal with current affairs we are here to vote on a report to give the Commission permission to resort to debt that is in time This debt in fact is only because there is no budgetary adjustment which is in the House of Deputies and it must be voted on Therefore when there is final approval in the other branch of Parliament the anticipation of EUR 14.3 billion will in fact become a simple round This is the first time we have voted on an act without any debt to our children Let us tell the Italians the truth then it is not true that there is paralysis because there is a government in office there is a Parliament still in office and it will be until the next Parliament is established scheduled for 13 October So those who told the opposite were obviously lying knowing they were lying Colleagues it is not a question of irresponsibility but of political will if you want to act for the good of the Italians you do so without stirring ghosts or ghosts and the measure we are discussing today demonstrates this Real immobilism on the other hand is not that of the few weeks that divide us from the vote but it is that of the past months and years with a pandemic that destroyed the country a war that has inflicted a further hard blow to our economy and a dear life that has come overpoweringly to crumble Italian companies and families In the past months we should have given answers and been as efficient as we are today with a decree that arrives in the Chamber to be voted in record times the real irresponsible are not us of Brothers of Italy who asked to go to the vote the real irresponsible are those who in recent months have kept the country in check hostage of the internal quarrels of a majority that has crumbled and of cross vetoes of the parties that have played on the skin of the Italians This was unfortunately the real reason that broke down Italian families and businesses In order to restart the country it was therefore necessary to turn the page and dismiss this legislature born badly and ended worse in which three majorities turned out to be a communion of parties that had nothing in common totally inadequate and heterogeneous majorities to face the challenges that history and the circumstances have proposed to us a terrible economic crisis triggered by a violent pandemic a war at the gates of Europe and now a galloping inflation Fortunately in a few weeks all this will be just a memory because Italians will have the opportunity to choose a coalition that is not a mixture of everything and the opposite of everything only to gather votes but on the contrary a communion of programs objectives and intentions aimed at giving the country back the greatness it deserves This is our wish to which as Brothers of Italy and as center right all of us are working In order to enter into the substance of this measure today we allow as I said before a temporary debt of EUR 14.3 million which we will not leave to future generations We agree to make this effort but provided that this time the resources are used as reported in the report signed by President Draghi and Minister Franco in black and white to help yes this time families businesses and public bodies to counter the price increases of energy products to combat inflation the consequences of the continuation of the pandemic and the consequences of drought We agree Undersecretary that this time the amounts of the extratragettito that we are receiving as a result of the increases of all these goods and services will be returned to the Italians through the aid that will be given with the next decree With the measures contained in the measure that we are funding we hope to see concrete interventions and no longer as unfortunately happened in the recent past tips bonuses and prebende which have turned out to be only palliative We want to see VAT cut on basic necessities We want to see the excise cuts on fuels extended and the social charges for electricity and gas bills cancelled We want to see the tax credits on bills extended for energy companies thus correcting also the mistakes that prevented companies from taking advantage of this last important facility What we do not want Undersecretary members of the Government President let us say clearly as we have already denounced in the recent past is that these 14 billion are used to finance some of the electoral districts as happened in part with the 200 billion that have disappeared in a thousand streams Too many resources have been wasted in these years of pandemics Let us ensure that at least this last provision is not used to do the interests of someone but rather to be aimed at the true common good We would not like to be in this House in a few weeks to report yet another gift to friends and friends of friends If that happens we 'll sue him heavily Therefore our vote as we have always said today will be in favour not of a government that we have opposed in every way not of a majority that has melted like snow in the sun but of a measure that goes in the direction of doing what has never been done so far really helping the Italian people Of course we are aware that the 14 billion and some further extension will not be enough because many problems must be fought at the source but this is no longer the task of President Draghi it is no longer the task of this Parliament it is no longer the task of this Government The new Parliament and the new Government which must be an expression of the Italian vote will take care of this Waiting for all this to happen we are sure that on this measure and for that little time remaining at this legislature you will find as has always been the willingness of Brothers of Italy to work and to legislate on everything that goes in the direction of helping our system Italy As I have already announced in the premises the vote of Brothers of Italy will therefore be favorable,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,16.42236,-7.8285213,15,mr calandrini fdi mr president regard report us today attitude past example

#CalandriniNicola,"Mr President first of all we would like to denounce the umpteenth institutional scorn that is taking place in this House President Draghi's pressure for the approval of this bill has no equal The hypothesis of a vote of confidence is a serious outrage to Parliament which has passed into the general silence of all the institutions By the government that defines the best by President Draghi who has a vast majority at his disposal we would have expected much more and something different On the other hand this Government continues to proceed by votes of confidence fifty in a little more than a year and by pressure as it did on this occasion we are talking about delegitimizing the role of this Parliament once again We want to remind President Draghi that the difference between the members of this House and his person is that we are legitimately elected representatives of the people while the President is an expression of a government born of palace games President Draghi always complains about the quarrels of the parties that support him but what did he expect from this government that is so heterogeneous We of the Brothers of Italy have always said from the first day that this majority is too different to be together and cannot bring anything positive compared to all these acts that we see approved in this House In this bill that we are about to convert into law in fact there is nothing good to save Inside there are provisions that literally cry out for revenge Our beaches were sacrificed for the estate of a majority who lost face lost dignity but obviously is not losing the chair Only the Group of Brothers of Italy has remained to defend 30,000 Italian companies that today are being expropriated their activity of a lifetime in the name of a competition that is all but fair competition As we have said in these weeks in these months a small company cannot buy the multinationals that will come once again to Italy to shop and grab many excellences built with years of sweat and sacrifices This agreement reached by the majority these days is embarrassing Do you really think that these compensations will restore dignity to those to whom you are deceiving the bathing establishments that have laboriously built started made jewels that have brought up the name of Italy and our sea in the world We do not know how much these compensations will amount to when they are paid on the basis of what criteria will be granted and how they will be calculated The agreement reached by this majority to allow the shameful application of the Bolkestein Directive is based on a we see then The truth is that the owners of today 's bathing concessions have been left without any kind of protection and then do n't tell us that the beaches are a caste as I heard in some intervention before mine that they pay ridiculous costs for their bathing concessions meanwhile because the amounts of concessions established them by the Ministry of Economic Development with an ad hoc decree and therefore if there was the need to increase them there was enough a decree But nobody talks not even in this House about the costs that the dealers themselves have to bear which are tenfolded in relation to the cost of the concession for the rescue at sea for the buoys for the cleaning of the beach for the storage Nobody talks about this Mr President The truth is that with this bill Italy not only gives the sovereignty of all its beaches to people we do not know today but also gives its sovereignty to the European Union The serious thing is that only Italy is accepting these impositions Spain Croatia and Portugal have extended their bathing concessions We do not understand why Italy could not do the same I 'm gonna finish A righteous government would defend its family jewels with its nails and teeth A government with sovereignist traction would never make discounts to anyone in order not to perpetrate the disaster that is taking place today But a government such as the one in office which has only its own survival at heart cannot do the national interest less so with a majority divided over everything We of Brothers of Italy will never tire of asking you to acknowledge the failure that is on the whole line Step aside do it for the good of the country and let the Italians choose who they are governed

#CalandriniNicola,"Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President we would like to point out also in the light of the speech by the rapporteur of the League on the measure to which our colleague Mr Iannone will reply more fully in an explanation of vote on the overall measure basically three issues which have been the subject of the sub- amendments we have tabled in Article 2 These issues are basically the no to the Bolkestein Directive resulting in the no to the auctions and last the no to the expropriation of Italian work Let us say this because we believe that the Bolkestein directive should not be applied with regard to goods and services In our opinion this directive should not and should not be applied on goods We have said this in a thousand different ways there were the conditions for opposing it but obviously neither the Government nor this branch of Parliament have done anything for this to happen Consequentially as I said before we remain opposed to the auctions of a fundamental structure for our economy that are our beaches on which 30,000 Italian companies have founded a tourism of excellence which has made Italy one of the most sought after destinations in the world where to spend the summer holidays and not only Finally let 's also say no to the expropriation of Italian work As you all know and we know with this measure we take away from 30,000 companies the fruit of the work of a lifetime treating the holders of these concessions as a caste of privileged Mr President we have also heard this in this House we have heard that the beaches are a caste of privileged people However no one has said that if they have paid minimum concessions the responsibility is of the Government which through the decrees has never raised the amounts of these concessions In addition nobody says what the costs are which have been tenfold in terms of bathing concessions rescue at sea buoys cleaning of the beaches and storage are all the costs for bathing dealers But nobody talks about this and speculates by saying that the amounts are very low because obviously no one has ever thought of increasing them That is also why we are against it This bill refers in its title to competition but the truth is that with these contents the only competition it will produce will be unfair but unfortunately unfair competition PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator Calandrini I do not know if you were referring to the amendments tabled by Brothers of Italy to Article 2 or to Article 3 Mr Calandrini FdI In the Commission the sub-amendments to Article 2 PRESIDENT The debate is closed He did not specify that these were the amendments tabled to the Commission I would also like to point out that the quota periods allocated to the Groups are also going to be scaled up by the interventions relating to the amendments",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,15.6283,-11.000238,15,"mr calandrini fdi mr president would like point also light speech rapporteur league measure colleague mr iannone reply fully explanation vote overall measure basically three issues subject sub- amendments tabled article 2 issues basically bolkestein directive resulting auctions last expropriation italian work let us say believe bolkestein directive applied regard goods services opinion directive applied goods said thousand different ways conditions opposing obviously neither government branch parliament done anything happen consequentially said remain opposed auctions fundamental structure economy beaches 30,000 italian companies founded tourism excellence made italy one sought destinations world spend summer holidays finally let 's also say expropriation italian work know know measure take away 30,000 companies fruit work lifetime treating holders concessions caste privileged mr president also heard house heard beaches caste privileged people however one said paid minimum concessions responsibility government decrees never raised amounts concessions addition nobody says costs tenfold terms bathing concessions rescue sea buoys cleaning beaches storage costs bathing dealers nobody talks speculates saying amounts low obviously one ever thought increasing also bill refers title competition truth contents competition produce unfair unfortunately unfair competition president debate closed senator calandrini know referring amendments tabled brothers italy article 2 article 3 mr calandrini fdi commission sub-amendments article 2 president debate closed specify amendments tabled commission would also like point quota periods allocated groups also going scaled interventions relating amendments"
#PepePasquale,"Mr President you will forgive me if I say that I make this brief speech as mayor rather than as senator proudly mayor of the third term of office of a small municipality The small municipalities which represent 69 percent of the Italian municipalities are 5,500 small municipalities that have been rediscovered in recent months and years like the architrave of Italy We all remember what the mayors did during the pandemic If there were n't those mayors along with the health staff how much greater difficulties Italy would have had and would have had to face the Italians Those mayors have taken on many responsibilities both in relation to what was the health sector and in relation to the distribution of vouchers to so many citizens where at first there were no rules but the only pulse of the situation was the state of need of so many families Then we also saw mayors on the front line And we are seeing them now during this incomprehensible and unjustifiable war in Ukraine while they welcome and stretch their hand all lined up and lined up women and children waiting to ask the state for help both financial and logistical Mr President now there is also a great expectation which I would like to point out here as far as the PNRR is concerned I feel too often that we have to wait for the mayors and their ability to implement the mayors and that the ability to develop a strategy lies with them Too many however are those who philosophize behind a desk and forget that very often mayors do not have the right tools to implement the PNRR I 'm on my own in the vast majority of cases Mr President I also say that in the various selections that have been made in recent months for the PNRR the results have not always been satisfactory I 'm talking about it from experience Fresh and competent forces often do not arrive in the municipalities neither fresh nor competent forces arrive unable to support the mayors As a result everyone refers to the mayors We 're proud ready we 're not gonna back down Let us however give the right recognition to those gentlemen who dress the tricolor band with dignity As many people have said before me the measure we are examining and will be approving shortly is important but it is a minority part of a broader and more incisive reform that we all hope for It starts from the inconferability of top management positions in bodies governed by private law under public control for those who have suffered a conviction even not final in the context of crimes against public administration We move through the abolition of the control of the management of small municipalities and we arrive at the third mandate As Senator Candiani said before we must say thanks to those mayors who are still in their place today who decide to run But we want many more reforms Some may relate to the single text of local authorities Legislative Decree No 267 of 2000 I can think of for example the profile of responsibility As far as I am concerned Mr President it was already quite clear Evidently however some magistrates pretended not to understand it or thought well that throwing a mayor in the papers rather than an executive would do more news Already from Bassanini laws however from the single text of the local authorities the tasks are clearly divided the politician and the mayor have the powers of political direction and political control the manager or the manager of the service the management and the assumption of the acts The mayor however is always there like a lightning rod The delegation law is now in place which we hope will lead to an even better clarification of this issue as soon as possible Therefore mayors will no longer oversee the operation of the services and offices nor will they oversee the execution of acts And we hope that this specification will finally put an end to the mayor 's criminal responsibility in particular Mr President I would also go further because this is an issue that has been raised by President Ostellari I would not just stop at the unique text of the local authorities but I would go further looking at the penal code and the official abuse that so many mayors have put under investigation and perhaps even under trial Then however in the vast majority of cases everything melted like snow in the sun since the abuse of office is subjected to the so called diabolical test because the mayor has never been in bad faith has not had the specific dole has not violated the norm has not violated the regulation and has not harmed anyone or any unfair advantage to anyone else A little courage would take to make this important change Among other things the President of ANCI said this this means not asking for impunity for the mayors but to make those people work in serenity and tranquillity knowing that where they were to commit crimes they will surely answer for their responsibilities Protecting mayors also means protecting democratic participation How many times in small municipalities we are forced to attend the presentation of so called owl lists where there are no people willing to sacrifice themselves and engage in an electoral competition and if anything also in the administration of the municipality Besides the mayors can't run anywhere but they 're there Even in small municipalities if they are not in town hall they are at the professional studio and if they are not even there they are at home They are present garrison of civilization and freedom to guarantee services and rights Another bad page for the mayors even to show that they are the outpost of the state on the territory is represented let us remember by the innumerable threats intimidating and offensive acts that suffer both de visu and now alas with the abuse of the use of social media Only in 2021 were the intimidating acts 722 We demand dignity and even more agility some others might speak of more powers because it is too easy to say that with direct election the mayor has more powers In fact especially in small realities the mayor does not have all these powers He has many responsibilities but he does n't have many powers because often in those realities he can't even choose the manager and the manager having to limit himself to choosing fortunately at least the municipal secretary To conclude I would like to mention Article 114 of our Constitution which was first mentioned in 2001 and which reads extraordinarily beautifully The Republic consists of the Municipalities Provinces Metropolitan Cities Regions and State These are the various institutional levels of our country that we believe must have equal dignity Senator Candiani said earlier that very often mayors can bring added value to institutions Many times speaking with friends I make a joke destined to remain so because it would not be allowed by our Constitution it would take a minimum of cursus honorum I believe that this is another aspect and it is up to the parties to make a selection But many local administrators and many more mayors in an institution like this would bring the royal country into the palace and render a far better service to the whole country",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,10.711264,-3.2285154,15,"mr president forgive say make brief speech mayor rather senator proudly mayor third term office small

#LaRussaIgnazio,Mr President in Office of the Council thank you for agreeing to transform the Premier Question Time which was scheduled for today into the information requested first by Senator Rauti of the Brothers of Italy at the Conference of the Leaders I listened to your speech very carefully but I also recorded the applause that came they were almost never of its entire majority but in pieces that is sometimes applauded one and sometimes applauded another So my curiosity has increased to understand what will be the attitude of the interventions that still have to follow One I just listened to President Renzi's You had to struggle not only in international fora but also in our home you had a little trouble putting together positions very wide apart I 'm not going to list the fact that Count says something and Di Maio says exactly the opposite It is yesterday that the Presidency of the Foreign Affairs Commission emigration which fortunately ended with the election of a responsible person such as Senator Craxi to whom I wish good work So I 'm curious how everyone 's gonna pull the blanket a little bit On the contrary there is no doubt as to what the position of Brothers of Italy is because it is clear and coherent We have always been anchored and we remain to the Western world for our common cultural and values roots as ours are stories of economic commercial and even military alliances that sink when the Republic was born It has been since 1949 that the Italian right in its various political expressions MSI National Alliance then PdL and now Brothers of Italy has always consistently sided I say it to those who wondered on this side of the world in support of the Western defensive instrument that is NATO We have always felt that the danger to our independence and freedom came alas from the East in the post war period Senator Renzi quoted Berlinguer who it is true at some point tried to change and I give him notice what in Italy was a radically different position of the left which still we heard him here and there and not in the PD echoes different positions We have entrusted the burden of our defence to NATO but at the same time at least for Brothers of Italy we consider it absolutely important that sooner or later a truly European pillar of NATO arrives because it is one thing to be an ally and another to be a subject There are those who are against any military expenditure and it drives me crazy but at the same time they get angry when the Americans to whom we entrust our defense saying think about it yourselves are interfering in our policy Decide If you do not want excessive interference if you want to be equal you cannot be against the efforts necessary for a defense that never like at this time proves absolutely indispensable President Draghi war is not a lightning strike you know it and everyone knows it Russia 's expansionist policy is the daughter of the ideology of its mother Russia and Putin 's attempt to take back the territories that were of the Soviet Union is evident That is what explains the behaviour of Moldova and Georgia and why Finland is asking to join NATO it is clear what the policy and desire of Putin 's Russia is I was saying about the Soviet Union Faced with this we have to imagine that it is absolutely right to put a stop How With a direct NATO intervention in Ukraine No we'd be crazy as it would amplify the conflict We need to help them defend themselves How do you help them defend themselves By sending all necessary aid including in terms of defensive weapons What do you mean defensive weapons I hear we have to send non-lethal weapons Do we send medieval shields and helmets I do n't understand Do we send out sprung kitchen knives The weapons to defend themselves are the ones necessary to turn back those who invaded them It has been since Ukraine was invaded that the possible reasons of the invaders have completely failed This is our position There could have been a different argument but they did n't want it Then we who have constantly said that the defense is always legitimate at home and we want it when a thief enters our home at this point we can not really understand how to imagine that it is not legitimate the defense of those who are attacked in the house of their own nation We bow to the heroic defense of men women Ukrainian soldiers and not only in Mariupol but throughout Ukraine without exception We are careful not to fall into Putin 's trap we do not believe that those who are still fighting in the steel mill as they are even more heroic are more evil We must give full solidarity without exception to the men and women who fight hard to defend their homeland and their freedom but also our independence They do n't do it for us but it 's a consequence and I 'm surprised there 's someone who does n't understand it I am surprised that we do not see how we should be in solidarity today with those who are attacked in their own territory and in their own geographical political and human integrity and that defending themselves affirms the principle that this can not be done Certainly it costs and brings with it some drawbacks We know that we may have to pull the belt a little bit but there are valuable reasons why it is right to do so and these are more than enough for us However there are also very concrete reasons which the naives probably do not understand the West has responded compactly to the Russian aggression and if Italy today became the weak link and soft belly of the West breaking this compactness and questioning military support to Kiev we would become the Parish of the West the unreliable State as we are often painted And this would have enormous costs for us in terms not only of security but also of relations with the rest of the West which also means economic and commercial relations which affect the well being of Italians President we are on the side of Italy we are on the side of the attackers And to those who take back the same arguments that they used in 1956 when Hungary was invaded and in 1968 when the communist tanks invaded Prague because they wanted the West to stand by and not intervene we say that the intervention in defence political and with the sending of necessary weapons is absolutely shared by the Brothers of Italy and is necessary for our nation,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,8.89432,-3.4325047,15,mr president office council thank agreeing transform premier question time scheduled today information requested first

#LaRussaIgnazio,THE RUSSIAN FdI Mr President thank you for noticing my request for an explanation of vote Those who have been careful about the referendar results will have realized that on the first two questions the distance between the yes and the no has been very different from the one that has been recorded on the other three questions Given the fact that on the left those who voted did not vote no on all five we felt perhaps wrong that the no to the first two referendary questions expressed by Giorgia Meloni and the Brothers of Italy were heard by a part of those who decided to go to vote also because the polls showed very clearly that the Brothers of Italy was among the parties whose voters were most involved in the referendum compared with the same proposers On this amendment therefore we are strongly opposed and not for the reasons I have heard here not for the issue that my colleague has well expressed namely that they can be at least partially used instrumentally but because we believe that the matter of protective custody should be dealt with more deeply In other words not only should the text that is necessarily a summary of the referendary question we do not blame the proposers but once the referendum does not exist the way to change the issue of protective custody in our opinion cannot be sic et simpliciter equal to the referendary text so our substantive no to this text is reiterated with transparency However there is a contrast in this House also through the arguments I have heard to justify the no which makes us imagine that we do not want to deal more fully with this issue as the Brothers of Italy desires For example it surprises us I must tell the friends of Forza Italia that Silvio Berlusconi 's party votes differently from the League which proposed the referendum but which in history has always expressed itself more cautiously on this issue than on Forza Italia Brothers of Italy in reaffirming the no to the text and the need for a more in depth debate on the failures of the current legislation of the protective custody which has often created unnecessary suffering and which in other cases we consider absolutely justified does not want in this case simply to join the no expressed by the left and I have heard with which arguments nor to participate with a yes or a no to a strange division of the center right on this issue between those who also participate in the Government and towards both we respect We do not want in this case to divide and divide ourselves within the centre right on a subject on which we have a common underlying sensitivity that is to want to review it So Mr President although I am absolutely opposed to the text which is necessarily a summary of the referendary question we will not be taking part in the vote in order to stimulate a real and thorough debate on the issue of protective custody,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,11.274639,-9.700315,15,russian fdi mr president thank noticing request explanation vote careful referendar results realized first two questions distance yes different one recorded three questions given fact left voted vote five felt perhaps wrong first two referendary questions expressed giorgia meloni brothers italy heard part decided go vote also polls showed clearly brothers italy among parties whose voters involved referendum compared proposers amendment therefore strongly opposed reasons heard issue colleague well expressed namely least partially used instrumentally believe matter protective custody dealt deeply words text necessarily summary referendary question blame proposers referendum exist way change issue protective custody opinion cannot sic et simpliciter equal referendary text substantive text reiterated transparency however contrast house also arguments heard justify makes us imagine want deal fully issue brothers italy desires example surprises us must tell friends forza italia silvio berlusconi 's party votes differently league proposed referendum history always expressed cautiously issue forza italia brothers italy reaffirming text need depth debate failures current legislation protective custody often created unnecessary suffering cases consider absolutely justified want case simply join expressed left heard arguments participate yes strange division center right issue also participate government towards respect want case divide divide within centre right subject common underlying sensitivity want review mr president although absolutely opposed text necessarily summary referendary question taking part vote order stimulate real thorough debate issue protective custody

#LaRussaIgnazio,"Mr President before addressing the President in Office of the Council I would like to address my friend Pharaoh who has just spoken Too bad that the two thirds of his speech could n't listen to them even President Draghi who had gone out I imagine after the intervention of the League giving almost a signal of what has already happened I noticed a bit of despair in your speech Senator Pharaoh indeed a lot of despair I understand that the spectre of the elections the fear the ghost of this democracy are approaching Italians who choose become the fear of horror films for many in this House When there 's an election it 's almost like you 're hiding in the house and putting sandbags in the window things like that President Draghi you were very clear I would like to begin by addressing you now Sometimes I fear that this system dominated by the left in the aspects of culture the judiciary art and journalism will be so strong that even the freedom of the President of the Council to decide to resign She had decided to resign and then threw her by her hair and feet to get her back here after six days a record since we usually return after twenty four hours to have time to orchestrate the campaign we saw with 1,500 mayors out of 8,000 and 150 people and no more so what people in front of the Teatro alla Scala in Milan to shout Titì nun ce lascià recalling an ancient film by Nino Manfredi as my colleague Rauti did before You President Draghi have been corrected Although they forced her back here you said that without the popular vote it is no longer possible to have a government with you as President He said that without the popular vote he needs to have a large majority to continue Speaking of the latest events he also added that the majority of people have been fed up the desire to be together has been exhausted there has been the end of the pact of trust with the contrary vote of the Movimento 5 Stars and that it is not possible to minimize this fact These are his words to which I add is it possible to minimize what is already happening in this debate Perhaps you did not notice because you spoke that the only standing ovation during your speech to which we also associated is when you quoted Falcone and Borsellino For the rest I did not see any applause and I am pleased from the friends of the League and also but it was obvious of the Movimento 5 Stars Moreover there was no applause if not someone isolated from Forza Italia I understand that the President in Office of the Council has left the Chamber again because the games are played There is not that large majority that the President considered necessary in order to continue The League Leader 's appeal to a new government with whom Not with the Movimento 5 Stars it has correctly found the responsibilities and the hard contrasts between the center right that was to the Government and the left that said that it is not part of the pact of Government and therefore we speak of free drugs and immigration or worse we do nothing to decrease the taxes indeed The government is gone On the other hand is there anyone raise your finger if there is one who really believes that the interventions that have been and will follow in which we talk about the need to keep the Government alive for a sense of responsibility are sincere Do we really think that Italia Viva has as its first objective to keep the Government alive for a sense of responsibility towards Italians Do any of you really believe that the Democratic Party is not looking with despair at nearby elections that would not finally see it probably will the Italians decide the opposition Does anyone really believe that Does an Italian believe that Then I understand who is afraid abroad President Draghi There 's a song by Gaber that says I do n't feel Italian but luckily or unfortunately I am I think it 's a feeling not about the President of the Republic but about someone We Italians are It is clear that there is someone abroad who has reason to doubt that a change of government can be negative What is this reason To fear that a new government will not be clearly and compactly deployed on the side of the West on the side of NATO on the side of aid to Ukraine Brothers of Italy who will never enter this Government if there is a center right government can guarantee that it will be a government on the side of the West on the side of NATO and on the side of Ukraine 's defence President Draghi then what are the reasons why we insist on voting This is a simple reason If it were true that interrupting the legislature today creates discomfort on some issues but when in a few months time this parliamentary term ends will everything be done Or even in six seven or eight months there will be questions that would advise them to ask but how do they vote So what 's the system you like A system where you never vote A system says Ignazio La Russa with an election ban A system with a government appointed by the President of the Republic without a popular vote The situation will not be different from what will be in six seven or eight months Even in eight months there will be questions that need a government Another assurance which I regret President Draghi does not listen if Parliament is dissolved and the Government Draghi remains in office for the ordinary administration which has very broad boundaries when a large majority wants to define it as such Brothers of Italy will continue to make the patriotic opposition that it has done all these years If action is to be taken while Parliament is dissolved you know well that Parliament loose can work until the new Parliament is established and the Government remains in office until the new Government is born we will be patriotic opposition There is no fear of power gaps in a democratic system The power gaps are only in dictatorial systems a dictator died there is a crisis There is no democratic system Why do we ask you to allow us to vote again Why do we have this need No President Draghi It is easy to understand that if you decide despite everything and against the interest of Italians to continue for Brothers of Italy there is a continuing tendency to increase consensus We have no private interest in that this experience of Government continues indeed we are convinced that the good of Italy the good of the Italians is to have a Government son of a program presented to the electoral consensus a Government son of a coalition compact with a precise project We are convinced that the good of Italians is to have a Government son

#deBertoldiAndrea,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen I hope that we are at the end of the comics and I hope that this situation which the Italians have now understood to be carried forward only for the sake of perhaps some of us but certainly not of the Italian people has come to an end I would first of all like to address the parties in the centre right but in general to the whole of Parliament and all political forces so that we finally have the courage to say the experience of a government that has tried for too long to unite everything and the opposite of everything and the extreme left to those who believe in meritocracy liberal values and autonomy has ended What were the results They are the ones we see in the squares and numbers and we read in objective sources not in the words of a representative of the opposition To begin with and I address the esteemed and co-regional friend and colleague who preceded me Senator Conzatti as irresponsible is to continue with this Government which we must stress has seen the public administration 's debt to enterprises increased by 12 billion to quote a number So the so called Govern of the best was not even able to reduce the impact of the debt that is penalising the entrepreneurial system because the public agency does not pay Not only did he not reduce him and with a banker of Professor Draghi 's level we had some hope too who were and remain in opposition but he even increased it by 12 billion What is worse ladies and gentlemen is the answers that could be given in a decree law that in my opinion has the arrogance today to call itself a decree aid after which I will explain why I speak of arrogance We could use the tax currency which could be a prompt and immediate response to companies that are not paid by the public administration it could be a prompt response to companies that are in difficulty because the State the Regions and the Municipalities do not pay them Those companies that thanks to the Draghi Government have seen an increase of 12 billion the exposure could be granted tax credits in maturity even five years but allowing these credits to circulate which is exactly what you are not allowing the building bonuses At last I want to take it in word the Movimento 5 Stars decides today it seems not to participate in the vote that is not to trust the Government on a topic like the building bonuses on which the Government is mocking the Italians Even in the decree law under consideration as colleagues know very well on the subject of the transfer of tax credits and the tax currency is not being made the interest of the country they are simply following the things that are said under dictation outside this country probably from Brussels and the financial companies that have interest in maintaining a certain type of rating for our country that have interest in that our country does not grow and maybe to that the financial companies of our country not because they are less good but because they have a lower rating cannot compete in the management of savings with those coming from outside our country maybe Germans and French In this way our savings are not managed and used in Italy but abroad These are therefore the answers that the Government and Professor Draghi must give not to the Brothers of Italy who are asking him but to the Italians who deserve to listen to them Do you really believe that Article 14 of the Decree Law helps solve for example the problem of 60,000 Italian companies that are about to fail because of the inconsistent and persevering position of the Government on the subject of superbonus The Government in fact on the one hand seems to give an opening and say to reopen the circulation of the credits allowing the banks with Article 14 to make an extra sale to the VAT consignments It is therefore allowed to the banks who do not buy more credits therefore the enterprises are crippled and the citizens are desperate to free their tax drawer and therefore to start again That would be the logic that any thinker might have Instead this Government on the one hand inserts Article 14 but on the other hand it happens at the same time comes out a circular of the Revenue Agency who knows who inspired according to which the assignee that is the entrepreneur who should buy the credit is responsible for the goodness of the credit itself You understand very well that first of all this is a forecast that does not serve because upstream there is a visa of conformity of the professionals therefore the activity of the banks and the insurances that have obviously verified everything therefore to pretend that a simple entrepreneur who does not do the work of the banker neither the State Controller or the official of the Agency of the income in buying the credit is also held responsible for what happened upstream means with one hand to give an opening and with the other to establish a closure then to make fun of the Italians Would that be help ladies and gentlemen Who says this government really believes that Italians have slices of ham on their eyes Do you really believe that 60,000 companies 500,000 workers and the about 5 million Italians involved in the superbonus have slices on their eyes and believe in your nonsense and your teasing We can always move forward on what you have the courage to call decree law aid There are tax credits that you recognize but by chance last week and it is not a coincidence because we of Brothers of Italy do not rely on the case we questioned the Government to ask how those tax credits should be treated The government has told us that they are on the same footing as non-refundable state aid so it means that we will overcome the ceiling so those companies to which you have recognised and recognised tax credits will have to return them to the state a further mockery I could then Mr President talk about tax credits in the energy sector In paragraph 3 b of Article 2 you linked the tax credit to the de minimis so in fact these companies will not take anything because with the de minimis they will not have the right to take this money This is another mockery I do not think it is an opinion these are objective data Starting to conclude because it seems to me that time is coming to an end I would also like the Government to give some answers to Italians and maybe even to us I of cognitive deficiencies will certainly have many We are waiting to hear from the government about fuels why fifteen years ago the cost to the barrel of oil was higher than today but the fuel cost considerably less You have to explain to us why today we are teasing Italians even at the petrol pump This is not the way to run a country We all have a whisper of dignity I ask you with my heart let us send Parliament before the voters let us give the country a coherent and loyal political majority that can finally govern and not make fun of this country",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#deBertoldiAndrea,"DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen after the draft competition law and after the bill of admission despite so many bad forecasts we have also arrived in advance at the adoption of the draft law on the reform of tax justice I address the parties that have done so much terrorism in recent months on the risk of elections we have come to secure the fourth instalment of the PNRR We concluded in advance the approval of that legislative component that was necessary for the fourth instalment that of December of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan We have concluded with the coherent effective and constructive contribution of the Brothers of Italy Group which always having the national interest at its centre never thought of putting itself out of the way when objectives were or would have been to be achieved So we have arrived ladies and gentlemen I would therefore also like to address the communication experts and those who outside this House have stormed us for weeks and they have done so in recent months saying that those who wanted the vote were irresponsible and those who wanted a Parliament finally expressing the Italian people and perhaps a Government expressing a more legitimate Parliament were irresponsible because when the Chambers had dissolved it would have been the end of the world nothing would have been approved and the PNRR would have skipped The conclusion as we have always said and as Giorgia Meloni has always said is that there has been no legislative paralysis and no institutional paralysis that we could continue to work as we have worked and as we will also work in September bringing at the same time the Italian people to say which Parliament wants to represent it and which will then be or will have to be the government that will take its lead and will take the country outside the sandboxes which all too often this legislature has instead provoked I would also like to know where those owls are who have hidden behind Professor Draghi 's esteemed professional figure in order to hide their inability those political forces in contradiction between them who however hid behind the figure of Draghi and who perhaps even today without their legitimacy and probably without permission hide behind the flag of Draghi to propose to the Italians an alternative that does not exist You have tried to avoid the elections behind the figure of President Draghi and today illegally I repeat because I do not know that you have been allowed you hide too many behind the figure of Professor Draghi to hide a lack of program and homogeneity that homogeneity that we in the center right have already achieved and that program that in the next few hours we will explain to the Italians because yes we are a coalition ready to govern the country Entering into the substance of the bill I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this point first of all the President of the 6th Commission of Alphonsus the undersecretaries Freni and Guerra who have supported us and all the colleagues who have loyally collaborated with us to reach this goal which could also be achieved in a more concrete and substantial way More could be done however we have done so and that was what mattered even for the considerations that I explained in the premise We of Brothers of Italy are very proud dear colleagues to have placed an element in particular as essential in order to allow the measure under consideration to reach the goal today I am referring first of all to filling an iniquity that prevented graduates in economics and commerce from accessing the roles of the tax judiciary It was something shameful which went against the interests of the citizens because we all know that tax commissions or tax courts as we will now call them are called upon to decide on business and business issues on which therefore economic business and tax competence was essential It was therefore unthinkable not to foresee the presence of graduates in economics and commerce Since the first day Brothers of Italy has placed this as an essential element to proceed and fortunately for Italians and for all citizens this has been accepted so we have come to a positive acceptance of our amendment The same reasoning applies to an amendment which has made it possible to clarify and those in the sector understand this the value of the dispute In the area of jurisdiction of the monocratic judge we have provided that because of the value of the dispute the virtual value should be taken into account otherwise the loss would have put the risk for the monocratic judge of having to decide on disputes of much higher value than that which can be referred to his field We are equally pleased to have obtained an agenda One of those acts that governments often disregard but this time who knows why we are convinced that the next Executive will not disregard the agendas of the day that have been approved therefore those approved in this context have a far greater weight because I repeat that whoever will take the reins of the next Government or at least we hope that it will will give them immediate enforceability the day after its establishment I am referring for example to a measure which is highly requested by the regions and the self governments on the facilitated definition of local taxes because in accordance with the principle of self government which at this stage has not been accepted as an amendment but as an agenda we want to allow the regions and local authorities to be able to reduce the amount of taxes and taxes due to them when taxpayers are ready to pay to solve the previous tax problems which already existed This is therefore a rule that has been requested of us by the Regions to which we will deliver it when we are given the opportunity to do so Further useful and important amendments have been adopted on the subject of pending disputes which will certainly be widened taking into account also what is happening at the Court of Auditors in accounting justice where there are no limits of EUR 50,000 EUR 100,000 or EUR 200,000 but there is the possibility of resolving disputes in agreement when the parties want to do so We will also move in this direction to solve the serious problem of the clogging of the magistrates So we 've dealt with some issues others we 'll deal with in the next legislature and we 're sure the government that 's gonna take care of them will have our consent Mr President I am abstaining because we did not want to put obstacles in the way We tried to improve this measure we would have expected more We had asked and this is one of the causes that leads us today to abstain that finally at the end of the hearing the device should be read and that the sentence be filed within fifteen days The agreement could not be reached so let us refer this to the next parliamentary term as well I shall conclude therefore Mr President with the hope that this will be a step forward and we are convinced that it is not only in order to obtain the funds of the PNRR but also in order to give full time as has been said to the tax judiciary therefore a greater guarantee to the interlocutors and investors who are approaching our country We are sure however that more needs to be done we need to make further improvements just as we need to do a real tax reform in the next parliamentary term Brothers of Italy have been seriously proactively consistently in this political phase by the opposition I believe that there will be even more force and seriousness in the next legislature",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,12.107132,-8.339032,15,"de bertoldi fdi mr president ladies gentlemen draft

#deBertoldiAndrea,"Mr President I would like to start with a positive note because I think it is right and proper to do so I am referring to the fact that even with a distance of three months from the budget law 2022 approved at the end of December the Government finally intended to follow up on the commitment it had made with Brothers of Italy when in the tax decree law a demanding agenda was approved binding on the budget law I would like to point out and emphasize to extend the terms of the break up b and balance and cancellation So three months later the government finally wanted to respond to this commitment We note this in a positive way Therefore it is a small and important piece which finally gives an answer to over 500,000 honest Italians who had been asked to pay in a month and a half what they could not evidently pay in almost two years of lockdown It is regrettable however to have to say that despite the amendment of Brothers of Italy despite the original agenda of Brothers of Italy the first party present in this Parliament the Movimento 5 Stars has tried to appropriate this in the main national newspaper It is indeed a fall in style which should not characterize those who make politics and sit in institutions As Mr Damiani acknowledged in his report for which I thank him that was an amendment by the Brothers of Italy And I repeat that a party in addition to the first party present in Parliament is appropriate in the first national economic newspaper I 'm really sorry Sorry that ethics and fairness even in the harshest political confrontation should belong to each of us So a positive note which however is covered by an act of wrongdoing that we did not like We are sorry I repeat and I stress that Having said that let us get to the bottom of the real problems Mr Calandrini the leader of the Brothers of Italy in the Budget Committee has been quite clear in denouncing in fact how this decree of support has only the name but certainly not the facts or in any case the facts are very few We are in fact in the midst of a financial storm due to Article 27 the problem of tax credits The government already has a thousand problems to solve we understand problems related to the pandemic the political energy crisis the international crisis that has aggravated all the other crises Well in all this marasma the government has found a way to put into crisis a path that of the building bonuses that was virtuous that we all thought virtuous He did it in an inconceivable and absurd way I repeat truly inconceivable and absurd Even the correction measures then identified in the so called bill decree did not actually serve almost anything I 'm used to talking about facts too In these hours I have received confirmations also from my region of certain data I can tell you that the current situation not in a financially weak and poor territory but in Trentino which is a consolidated and structured reality is as follows today the main banking realities have exhausted the plafond of use Banca Popolare di Sondrio ITAS Assicurazioni primary Italian insurance competitor Mediocredito Banca di credito cooperativee di Verona e Vicenza coffers rural and other national banks Unicredit and Gruppo Intesa are in the process of being exhausted This is the fact that you are failing You were wrong In the decree law supports you have done irreparable damage to the system and in the decree law bills you have not even been able to repent and to put back on track in a correct way the path that characterized the bonuses and the superbonus What 's worse is that whoever gets into this is the whole country It is the Italian companies the construction companies the construction companies the financial companies that had worked in the sale of the credits the citizens who find the yards blocked who cannot move forward and who at best today thanks to your measures Mr Undersecretary are in fact having to sell the credit and therefore take much less than what the State invests More than 110 percent We are moving towards 60 70 percent when it 's okay because in most cases today they can't even bring home a euro Then the measure under discussion should be called decree law support Someone might object that there have been fraud Of course there have been but certainly not in the princely measure that was the superbonus because in that case there was a very simple norm that actually stood I am referring to the visa of conformity professional ope ligis obliged to insurance that countersigning a practice guaranteed its existence in fact fraud in the superbonus does not even reach 1 The fraud took place where the government left the doors open as they say in the bonus facades where there was no control Does the government need the best to predict that if there is a weight relief if there are state tax credits there must be a minimum of control I therefore wonder why you continued to insist on taking action by restricting the transfer of credits You did not have to intervene in that area because the sale of credits had nothing to do with it as the 110 measure shows You simply had to understand that the credit must be identified at the origin must be traced on a financial platform in its passages and must be accompanied by a visa of conformity With the passages of identification origin X and Y particle traceability of the transfer path which can therefore be infinite if moved on the financial platform and visa of conformity the government would be protected would protect the Erario would protect the citizens and would avoid waste Instead despite the fact that with its constructive opposition you have always said so you have decided to limit the transfer of credits which is of no use but to destroy a measure I therefore appeal to the political forces that are in the government that sit in this Parliament and that I am convinced feel the same way as I do about this It is not enough for them to say it the way we do it because we have no other means than to be able to speak except sometimes to be expropriated even of our work You are in the government you have a duty to change these things You have a duty to put an end to the destruction of certain measures Rather have the courage to say that they are all cancelled because this would be an act of seriousness it would not be shared but it would be an act of seriousness We cannot destroy a measure by creating barriers to art or even by doing so in origin I believe that there is bad faith by not providing for control measures and therefore determining fraud which were predictable and which however today are used to oppose the tax currency the transfer of tax credits I repeat therefore that there has been bad faith Starting with the conclusion to take up the words of my colleague Calandrini and many arguments carried out also by other political forces the present decree law supports will not support almost anything or very little We need a revision of the PNRR which is no longer current and we also need another one linked to international crises we need a budgetary deviation and we need real energy policies On these issues we would like the Government to be judged on these issues we would be happy for the Government to be labeled as the Government of the best we would be happy for the opposition because it would mean that in that case our country and our fellow citizens would have the answers they deserve but unfortunately today it is not so",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,14.496084,-8.269876,15,"mr

#deBertoldiAndrea,Mr President we are also here today and we will alas be talking about one of the many reforms connected with the PNRR in the coming weeks and months I would very much like to be able to call them reforms and unfortunately we are faced with agreements agreements made by a majority which even a young boy with the first arms in civic law would understand in order to contemplate everything and the opposite of everything every time he has to make compromises downwards Nor do such compromises often express the will of the parties that support the majority who often come under the dictatorships that are likely to come from Brussels My colleague Mr Calandrini said this earlier but why do n't you look around You talk so much about Europe then look what they do in Spain In Spain the beaches are protected because they consider the beaches of goods and not services Look at what they do in Germany and Austria where hydro- electric concessions are constantly being renewed by whistling bans We Italians on the other hand obviously have to suffer the Brussels Diktats and immediately put the concessions to competition expropriate the beaches To do what To make more efficiency and competition No it 's not exactly that You see our tourism has always looked at the specificity of our country Always look at those bars those beaches that are characteristic of families expression of Italian individuality Well you will want with the new bans put coasts bathrooms bars and restaurants of our beaches in the hands of the multinationals You would like to have many Nestlé many equal structures that no longer identify a origin and a territory but represent only an interest and above all an interest that comes from foreign countries That 's what the National Emergency Government is doing The emergency is what you are causing with this Government which I repeat no longer represents as a parliamentary force the majority of Italians and which moreover no longer represents the forces that support it forces that do not have the courage to give it distrust because they know very well that they will go home This is the dramatic situation in which we find ourselves Instead of making C series reforms I would then like to make a proposal to Deputy Minister Pichetto Fratin whom I esteem and who I know that on these issues he thinks like me and at the same time I do it to the friends of the League who certainly did not have much satisfaction in their first Count government in approving citizenship income Let 's make a reform that finally meets the needs,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,16.10164,-5.661492,15,mr president also today alas talking one many reforms connected pnrr coming weeks months would much like able call reforms unfortunately faced agreements agreements made majority even young boy first arms civic law would understand order contemplate everything opposite everything every time make compromises downwards compromises often express parties support majority often come dictatorships likely come brussels colleague mr calandrini said earlier n't look around talk much europe look spain spain beaches protected consider beaches goods services look germany austria hydro- electric concessions constantly renewed whistling bans italians hand obviously suffer brussels diktats immediately put concessions competition expropriate beaches make efficiency competition 's exactly see tourism always looked specificity country always look bars beaches characteristic families expression italian individuality well want new bans put coasts bathrooms bars restaurants beaches hands multinationals would like many nestlé many equal structures longer identify origin territory represent interest interest comes foreign countries 's national emergency government emergency causing government repeat longer represents parliamentary force majority italians moreover longer represents forces support forces courage give distrust know well go home dramatic situation find instead making c series reforms would like make proposal deputy minister pichetto fratin esteem know issues thinks like time friends league certainly much satisfaction first count government approving citizenship income let 's make reform finally meets needs

#deBertoldiAndrea,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen I believe that the day we are going to live today and the decisions we are going to take could finally turn this country into a turning point I am sorry that the President in Office of the Council has now absent himself but I am addressing his ministers and I am addressing the Government I make a reflection Brothers of Italy makes a reflection after listening to the words of the President of the Council a very clear reflection The President made a clear contradiction on the one hand he reiterated that this was a government that was once called national unity on the other hand he confirmed in fact and I will prove it that this is a government that is direct and determined by the Democratic Party Why do I say that ladies and gentlemen I say this because the President in Office of the Council has clearly struck the so called centre right of government he has referred to issues such as the land register the Bolkestein directive taxi drivers talking about it in an irritated grieved way he has ignored the sentiments that the centre right part of the government has brought in these months On the other hand the President of the Council has made no reference to the divisive elements in his government that have been bullied by the Democratic Party in recent weeks I have not heard a word Mr Draghi about the legalization of drugs about ius scholae I did n't hear a word and maybe these were n't divisive themes And then a government of national unity as we have called it certainly cannot be based on a party that is carried in the palm of hands and on some political force which moreover is majority which instead is almost ridiculed in its own behavior and in its own demands One thing is clear President Draghi you have made a field choice perhaps I do n't know you are preparing to go on the field with the Democratic Party but at least we will be happy to discuss with you on the issues of economic freedoms meritocracy ethics Christian values that inspire us We will be happy to deal with you and with the arguments of the left but at least we will have clarity at least the Italians Mr President will say which side they want to be on Mr President in Office of the Council you said that you must stay because the Italians are asking you it is very serious what you said Mr President because in democracy it is not the appeals of someone who counts but as Giorgia Meloni said it is the vote of the Italians that must be respected not the appeals of some area And as for the mayors I want to say thanks to that clear majority of mayors over 6,000 who have not signed any appeal because they have respected their citizens A mayor represents all citizens even that majority of the country strongly opposed to such a government So what are the Italians Ministers and President in Office of the Council who are asking you to remain in the government Certainly not the majority as is certainly not the majority of Italian mayors I want to make some other considerations President let 's talk about responsibility For a few days we have read the newspapers the whole so called regime press with the big newspapers the televisions the news the opinionists with the Rolex on the wrist who come to talk to us about responsibility but what responsibility I also address President Casini with affection and friendship what responsibility Brothers of Italy tell you what responsibility is I remind the mainstream that if we decide to go to the vote we have a month of election campaign because in August the Chambers are closed So we 're gonna have a month of campaigning while you guys prefer to do nine months of campaigning You would like for your responsibility to leave Italy in the election campaign for nine months in which the Democratic Party will talk about ius scholae ius solo and the legalization of drugs the center right will instead say its thesis mocked as it has mocked it just today President and Italy will remain blocked and firm Or Mr President in Office of the Council you should clarify that a little better Today he made a list of emergencies he spoke about the problems of the country that we all know and that above all believe me know the Italians pensioners who do not arrive at the end of the month those who see the bills doubled the workers of those companies that thanks to the mess you made on the superbonus are home without salary There are 60,000 businesses that are failing at the Ministry of Economic Development MISE there are 170 crisis tables and the only ones solved I think are the Venetian ones solved by our Councillor Donazzan thanks to the commitment of those who really believe in work and politics So Mr President either you think you can solve all these problems in September having failed to resolve them in a year and a half of government or perhaps a government elected by Italians and citizens should solve them Or perhaps some of you I happen to address the Democratic Party believe that a government elected by citizens is not entitled to resolve the emergencies of the country Do you think that having on September 26 a government finally expressed by the majority of Italians it is not legitimate to solve the problems Perhaps you want the Italians to believe that the Government even in that month in which it would not be in full power could not carry out the activities of ordinary administration that is to issue the decrees that also serve for the PNRR You know very well that you can work until the new government is installed Then read the Constitution since you mentioned it so much work but give the word to the Italians because from early October we will finally have a Parliament expressing the will of the people and a Government finally expressing a cohesive parliamentary majority The majority will be center right we are confirmed by all this ardour all this assault that is coming from the consolidated powers those powers that for years have not won the elections but that for years badly administer the country for the Italians and well administer it for themselves Here the comparison is between the real responsible that it is us between those who really want the good of the country and those who instead want the good of their armchairs and who maybe want to arrive in May to make a few hundred nominations of state This is the discrepancy and Italians know it they are not fooled by the empty words that are said We are proud to be responsible because for us the responsibility is declined by giving the floor to the citizens and the Italians they and they alone I am going to conclude Mr President will decide who will have to sit in the scans and ministries in which you now sit in my opinion not representing the country Long live Italy",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,9.166652,-4.920732,15,"mr president ladies gentlemen believe day going live today decisions

#deBertoldiAndrea,DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President I begin by thanking my colleagues and the structures of the Senate for the cooperation of these years synthetically I want to emphasize that also in the decree law in question we have seen the characteristic of the Brothers of Italy Group For four and a half years including this phase we have been a constructive serious opposition which has tried never to obstruct but to improve as much as possible the legislative production of this House both in this House and in the Commissions Of course we would have expected even more from this decree-law By the government that has been called the best and I think this adjective will probably be used very rarely we would have expected some strategic vision We would have expected perhaps Mr President that alongside the due and due bonuses and aid to businesses and citizens obviously not enough but we are waiting to see the next measure too there would be some hints of energy policy We would have expected answers in relation to national gas fields For months Brothers of Italy has been at the ribs of the Ministry and the Government asking for it to start again with the extraction of national gas nothing even in this decree law The same can be said about thermo-towers There is no mention of any prospect even of clean nuclear power Basically we see the immediate content but nothing strategic of that strategy that this country needs so much Surely if the Italians give us the chance we will be able to demonstrate in the first days of the next legislature that we will carry out paths of strategy and of energy and industrial policy for the growth of the country As far as the subject of the superbonus is concerned Brothers of Italy expressed appreciation as I said in my previous speech after pressing for almost a year the majority in parliamentary committees and classrooms saying that it did not make sense to prevent the free movement of tax credits and limit the tax currency which is still one of the strategies to avoid the country 's indebtedness and for the future Well we have said this and repeated it for months and finally in this decree law that was born in the electoral campaign the entire Parliament in fact complied with the requests of Brothers of Italy Maybe if they listened to us a little earlier if maybe those who supported the government of the best had listened to us today we would have fewer companies in crisis and fewer construction sites blocked In the light of all this I would have appreciated from the Government that in the face of these serious mistakes it had granted at least an extension today to 30 September for the achievement of the 30 of the work in single family homes It was because of that blockage to the credits that crippled the system The government had to extend it and despite our pressure it did n't grant it Brothers of Italy I repeat has been constructive it has brought its own contribution but for the reasons mentioned above can only abstain in the face of the decree law in question,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,12.889071,-7.861624,15,de bertoldi fdi mr president begin thanking

#CirianiLuca,CIRIANI FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen the first thing I would like to say on the premise is that we think as a force of opposition but I believe everyone here in the Senate that at such a serious and difficult time for Italian politics when we do not know if we will have a government this afternoon there is only one place where the President of the Council should stand now and that place is here in the Senate of the Republic because we want to confront the President not the empty benches of a ghost government The second thing I would like to say is that we have read the agencies because we are not in the majority and we know of the attempts made this morning to try to keep the majority together not on trust without voting on trust but by voting on the amendments in such a way that we can continue in government action according to such a Byzantine reasoning that no one has managed to understand it I want to remember that because when some of you some of the newspapers or televisions or some of the intellectuals who are crazy come to tell us that this is the Government of seriousness we will remind him of the scenes from the low empire this morning We are faced with terrible and epochal challenges some of which have already been mentioned by our colleagues in the Group who have spoken I will mention only one fact that has been released with the latest bulletin of the Authority for Energy in the last year the average price of the gas bill for Italian households has risen by 70.7 the electricity bill from now to July 2023 will rise by 91.4 I too am forced to make the geopolitical picture I dare say of the situation in which we are all involved there is war 700 kilometers from the Italian border there is a huge difficulty in guaranteeing the supply of gas there is a huge problem to get the grain out on the Black Sea there is the risk of famine in African countries there is the very real risk that famine generates new migratory waves that add to those already existing there is the problem of inflation never so high since 1986 there is a pandemic that we do not yet know if it is behind us there is a drought crisis that brings agriculture to its knees These are all the emergencies that Italians worry about and that Italians believe should be at the heart of the government 's action However it would take a strong cohesive and serious government instead we for weeks I have lost count of how many we live in a bubble made of blackmail theater ultimatum and penultimateum all of which belong to the worst first Republic We have a former President of the Council Count who still has to work out the double mourning resulting from the division of Di Maio and his eviction from Palazzo Chigi and that one day yes and the other also bombards the Government The President of the Italian Council is on a mission to Kiev in the war zone and while he is in Kiev he does not know if his country has a foreign policy because in the same days in Italy his majority of foreign policies put in place three or even four And then a few days later in Madrid we have a NATO historical meeting to decide the entry of Sweden and Finland but our President of the Council Draghi must return hastily to Italy he is a beautiful figure that our country makes on the international scene You tell us that the Government is the one that guarantees the image of Italy abroad Well Draghi takes the plane returns to Italy because it happens that Conte Grillo and pieces of the 5 Stars blame each other for being totally inadequate And if they say so we of course believe it If that were not enough the Democratic Party planted its ideological flags in the House knowing that it had no chance of having the ius scholae or the law on drug liberalisation passed with the sole and sole purpose of irritating and provoking the allies of the center right Faced with this with what has happened and is happening we have been waiting for weeks President colleagues for someone from the government to stand up and say or shout Look my boys the recreation is over But no one stood up to say that President It seems that the government is a Titanic going towards the rock as the orchestra sounds louder and louder and more and more crowded The so called best government has come to the judgment of public opinion and Parliament saying that it would be the government that would guarantee reforms important things the fight against emergencies stability but the result that you bring here today is exactly the failure on all these fronts You give us today the failed balance sheet of your government action I am asking those who have asked even in these hours whether the Government should continue its action even after would you entrust the government of Italy in the autumn to a majority that falls because it is not able to approve the realization of a thermovaluer in the province of Rome If you are unable to approve this what reforms can you approve in the autumn What kind of emergency war can you make if you can't even do the politics ABC This is because there are no technical governments there are no institutional governments there are only political governments This is a political government with everyone in it But a political government with everyone in it can't help but end up doing it it 's going to crash It 's like driving a car in which there are passengers each of whom wants a different destination The end is this either you stand still or you go against the wall Unfortunately what we are witnessing is exactly the clash of the Government against a wall and in doing so brings with it also the destiny of Italy Mr President I do not know we will now listen to the final explanations of vote what the Members of the Movimento 5 Stars will say I know that in recent weeks they have said that they want to stay in the government but also stay out of it that they vote for trust but they do not vote for it that they are against this Executive but the Ministers are very close within the Commission I would like to say that the situation is serious but it is not serious Even with regard to this we of Brothers of Italy claim goodness rightness courage foresight the seriousness of having remained the only force of opposition and we reiterate once again that we are not and will not be willing to make the stamp of any government because we just want to be part of a government elected by the citizens of center right Mr President ladies and gentlemen I regret that President Draghi is not here because I would like to tell him that we expect him because we believe he is a serious person apart from political differences to be consistent with what he announced only 48 hours ago at a press conference when he said that there is no and there will not be another Dragon Government following this without the current majority I would add that only those who fear or despise democracy are afraid of election day This majority ladies and gentlemen is over and this Government is also over Let 's give the Italians the floor with the vote let 's finally let them decide who they are governed

#CirianiLuca,CIRIANI FdI Mr President the request just made by Mr Malpezzi is of course shared by us Already at the last Conference of the Leaders we said that the presence of Mr Di Maio could not be sufficient in the light of the seriousness of the situation which unfortunately already yesterday apart from the events of this night was perceived as dramatic Therefore it is absolutely urgent for the President of the Council to report to Parliament on the actions Italy intends to follow up with regard to the dramatic crisis that is taking place As the Brothers of Italy Group we confirm our condemnation of what is an unacceptable military attack on a sovereign state and against international law And we ask you to know from the voice of President Draghi what are the choices reactions and measures Italy intends to take together with European and international partners in the hope that at least this time the European Union and the West will be able to make their voice heard,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,11.236653,-5.0462427,15,ciriani fdi mr president request made mr malpezzi course shared us already last conference leaders said presence mr di maio could sufficient light seriousness situation unfortunately already yesterday apart events night perceived dramatic therefore absolutely urgent president council report parliament actions italy intends follow regard dramatic crisis taking place brothers italy group confirm condemnation unacceptable military attack sovereign state international law ask know voice president draghi choices reactions measures italy intends take together european international partners hope least time european union west able make voice heard
#CirianiLuca,CIRIANI FdI Mr President President Draghi colleagues finally the Government after weeks of waiting referrals and solicitations also on our part reports to Parliament and the Senate on crucial and vital issues for our country for our economy for our security and also for the international prestige of Italy It should do so by virtue of a strong clear and united mandate but it is clear that it is not and will not be so We have read the resolution of the majority which has arrived precisely in the last few minutes it seems to us the usual mind fragile fragile made to please everyone and not displease anyone I will also give you another impression that I had Mr President in the twenty minutes of your report I felt more concerned not to say than to say to fade to avoid and not to displease anyone I understand that because its majority is really difficult to hold together it is an absolutely chaotic majority The problem however and the question that we ask ourselves on behalf of the Italians is what is the foreign policy of the Italian Government Is there only one party or are there so many parties that support it We have also seen like all Italians the television images of his trip to Kiev and compared to this arise at least two considerations The first is that the journey that you have made with the leaders of France and Germany takes place three months behind the similar one that the conservative leaders of Poland the Czech Republic Slovenia and England have made almost as if they wanted to send a message to Ukraine let 's see what happens and then we put our feet on the land of Ukraine That was n't a good message in our opinion The second question Mr President is that as the images of you and the other European leaders visiting Kiev and the suburbs of the capital the places of horror flowed on televisions in the homes of the Italians your majority continued to fly the rags as it has been for weeks and as it has happened up to a few minutes before you entered this Chamber I have here with me only a small part of the dozens of articles speeches and interviews that pieces of the majority have released against other parts of the majority or that pieces of the majority have released against the Government It really is not a great spectacle in which he distinguished himself alas a former President of the Council on which I do not want to extend myself because I do not have time and because I do not want to inflame for the sake of Fatherland Something else has happened His Minister for Foreign Affairs was put on trial and distrusted by his own party which is the first party in his majority this was because the Minister for Foreign Affairs shared the foreign policy of the President of the Council No one here but above all outside this House and outside the national borders among those who look at us may not consider what happened extremely serious for the reputation of our country I want to say to you President as a convinced opponent of your Government that Italy does not deserve a foreign policy made up of cleverness ambiguity and divisions especially at a time when there is a war 700 kilometers from the border of Trieste It is foreign policy you teach me this Mr President which qualifies and defines a government especially in the eyes of international chancellors However its majority is also arguing about foreign policy Indeed I would like to say that it is mainly arguing about foreign policy You can't you can't listen to people say We are with NATO but we are against arms we are absolutely pro-Atlantic but we are against military spending we are at the side of the Ukrainian people but against sanctions we are at the side of the heroic Ukrainian people but we do not recognize the Ukrainian people 's right to defend themselves their freedom their cities President all people of common sense all people who have a shred of humanity can only hope and work for peace or at least for a ceasefire But you and your colleagues will forgive me because I do n't want to seem pedantic or pompous five hundred years ago in Italy in Florence a gentleman named Niccolò Machiavelli wrote definitive things about how men are doing and how the world is going because then in the end politics moves with realism and pragmatism The first rule is that unarmed solidarity with an assaulted people is only rhetoric that the unarmed diplomacy offered to an attacked people is useless and ruinous and that the search for peace for peace that is the pacifism of which many fill their mouths is only another name that we give to unconditional surrender President and colleagues on 7 April you explained the DEF that the Italians were called to choose between peace and air conditioners Unfortunately we must note that we do not have peace and we have no guarantee of the functioning of the air conditioners either We have proposed a resolution which seemed to us of absolute common sense a maximum price for gas a European solidarity fund for the countries most affected by the crisis an international fund to avoid famine in North Africa You have said no and it is surprising as is the obstinacy President with which its majority continues to reject our amendments which call for the use of Italian gas fields in the Adriatic Sea which are not used or underused while our neighbours naturally do not waste time I must conclude because I only have eight minutes at my disposal we of the Brothers of Italy Group are not and will not be from now on for more reasons the crutch of the Government Once again we are proud of the courage in this House to have been the only force of opposition but we are well aware of the duties and responsibilities that derive from our European and international position Above all our leader Giorgia Meloni who is also the leader of European conservatives knows this This is the strength on which we have built our consent which is so annoying especially to professional haters who stand on the left Mr President we have said this from day one we are the ones who do what they say we are doing it only in the name and in the interest of Italy and we will do it today without asking for anything in return as far as we are concerned that is all that matters,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,10.33552,-5.5626893,15,ciriani fdi

#CirianiLuca,CIRIANI FdI Mr President at the end of the debate on this Conference on the future of Europe we can say that at least one positive fact has led to it it has confirmed to us that the most important European institutions the Commission Parliament and the Council feel that they do not adequately represent the wishes of the citizens There is some difficulty in feeling truly representative of the peoples and citizens who elected them otherwise they would not explain this will and this project to build such a long and complicated session of listening to citizens and peoples In fact national parliaments and the European Parliament already exist to listen to and represent the wishes of the citizens Obviously in all this something does not work if you have set up this complicated phase Moreover this long Conference on the future of Europe which as Mrs Rauti has also explained has had a very long complicated and very troubled gestation in fact in its construction and also in its final outcome responds to the same defects and limitations as the institutions that wanted it that is the terrible bureaucratic slowness the distance from the expectations and sensitivities of the citizens the craftiness and inevitably the great desire for it The problem however remains what I mentioned earlier namely what a conference on the future of Europe needs which should express the will of the citizens when the elected parliaments are already there to do this It seems to me a little bit to feel in these arguments what we felt until a few years ago when a political force represented today in Parliament in fact the most important political force represented in Parliament said that it was necessary to bypass Parliament that one is worth one that it would be the Internet and social media that would determine the policy of the future We know the damage this vocation has caused yes genuinely populist and demagogic of politics the deletion of the idea of delegation for which Parliament is bypassed and people are directly listened to But who are these citizens and who has given them the task and the burden of fully representing the will and ideas of their fellow citizens This nobody has explained so much so that both today and in the European Parliament we have declared that the selection path of this audience and this panel of European citizens remains very mysterious very opaque and not transparent On the other hand it is a very small representation of the European population chosen with criteria that still remain very untransparent for us Another point that must inevitably be stressed unfortunately and without particular satisfaction is that this Conference on the future of Europe has hardly ever been heard of neither in the media nor in the newspapers nor in the news I have not seen a single person I have met in recent years and I have met so many in my political activity who has asked me what was going on at the Conference on the future of Europe This is because in fact almost no one except the specialists knew of its existence In the first formulation of the motion tabled by colleagues from the Democratic Party and the 5 Star Movement there was a hypothesis that we clearly rejected that is the idea of automatically promoting the proposals made in that forum and of transferring them to the will of the parliaments and then of the Government It was an unacceptable proposal because Parliament is not the passcard of the Conference on the future of Europe and because those proposals were the most varied the most heterogeneous and even the most contradictory We are here to do our duty which is also to discern the proposals on which we have a positive opinion from those we are naturally opposed to So the risk would be to create terrible confusion and to promote contradictory measures However since we were talking about major issues and even about the revision of the Treaties that are at the heart of the European Union we have allowed ourselves to fly just as high and we have said that if we have to talk about this then we have to talk about the whole of the European framework also in the light of the historical events that are taking place at the borders of the European Union I am referring clearly to Ukraine We believe that this is the time to reiterate that the European Union as it has been structured over the decades is not what we have imagined Ours is a different model confederal in which States largely maintain their sovereignty but they give up that slice which is useful to create a political European Union on the major issues that we have blanked out in our motion security defence foreign policy and geopolitics trade policy migration and demographic policy and the major health issues related to natural disasters This is what Europe should strive for and converge on This is certainly not the Europe we have known which has been marked by pervasive legislation I would say all pervasive growing and meticulous Europe deals with thousands of issues that are not important often bothering citizens and businesses but it does not deal with and does not care about major issues so it remains an economic giant and a political dwarf It is clear that if Europe wants to be different and to become a political protagonist it must have a common foreign policy and to do this it also needs a common army and a common military policy all things that are not there and that when they appear they immediately find the resistance of the same parties and movements that call for the European Union 's protagonism against China against the United States etc Our motion is a way of reaffirming the diversity of our approach to these great issues which does not mean being anti-European but rather perfectly pro-European in a different Europe stronger and even more supportive on the big issues and not on the small ones in search of a single standard that can enter into the detail of the activities and life of all citizens from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Finally Mr President with reference to the historical and cultural roots of the European Union which with an absurd choice have been removed from the foundations of the Statute of the European Union itself I am referring to the classical Jewish Christian cultural roots of Roman law Greek philosophy etc I do this because in just a few minutes we will discuss in this same Chamber the figure of St. Francis of Assisi Then I wonder could the Europe we know be the same without the medieval roots built by St. Francis and the culture of monks Benedictine abbeys and monasticism That culture is not Catholic or Christian but it has saved classical culture and delivered it to posterity We would not be what we are if we did not have this behind us even the figure of St. Francis with all that he represented for the history of Italy and Europe So ladies and gentlemen we will abstain on the agenda that the majority has proposed because we recognise this it is a step backwards from the first motion which was unacceptable but there remain great differences from the strategic vision that you have set out which seems to us very weak compared to what we imagine which I repeat is the dream of a different Europe If Europe does not wake up now with what is happening in Ukraine I think it will never wake up,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,14.181479,-3.7172453,15,ciriani fdi mr president end debate conference future europe say least one positive fact led confirmed us important

#CirianiLuca,CIRIANI FdI Mr President in the light of the statements made by Mr Amendola I would like to make the request for a separate vote on the motion for a resolution by the majority and if necessary on my first signature of the motion for a resolution by the Brothers of Italy Group President Draghi members of the Government ladies and gentlemen tomorrow 's European Council is the first after the word war with its terrible meaning has entered into the vocabulary and political agenda of all European Chancellors indeed of the world We are clearly faced with a leap in quality and a change of paradigm in politics after many years have explained to us that globalisation would bring peace to the world and remove borders states and differences between political systems It has not been so it is not so and more importantly it will not be so and we will all have to realize it in a very serious way not to be as someone has said with very effective expression in these weeks mere tourists of history observing the history that passes by us without not realizing it Tomorrow 's European Council many of my colleagues have already said so and President Draghi mentioned this in his reply is crucial to understanding where our continent is going and for example if Europe wants to be a political entity with its own foreign and military policy However it must be clear that this can only happen if we radically change the approach that Europe has taken so far To date Europe has dealt with a thousand unimportant things often breaking the boxes of citizens and businesses and never a few really important things including at the top of the list foreign and military policy This also means rethinking our role within NATO not Italy 's membership of NATO but I repeat the role we want to play as a country and as a European community In fact we have to confess that we have given NATO a blank delegation on our defence because we were pleased to be unaccountable and to entrust the American giant with the resolution of international conflicts since they are merely compressive Finally having a foreign and military policy means perhaps more important and difficult increasing military spending because there is no other way Mrs Rauti mentioned the projects that started they are little but they are a sign in the direction that we all wanted and that Brothers of Italy promoted by formal acts amendments declarations and resolutions often unfortunately rejected in the past years This is unless President Draghi in its majority as I think we are snooping one does not think that this we are living is just a parenthesis of history After the night everything goes back to the way it was before and we go back to not seeing the problems hoping that if there are problems someone will solve them for us So we will be in fact the tourists of history As I said this attitude of the many is perceived also within the majority As it happens those who say that military spending is not important and priority let alone They 're the same people who 've been saying no to everything all these years They said no to gas oil regasifiers and nuclear renewable sources said yes but please not in their constituency but in the next one We are dealing with a majority that I do not know if it has fully understood the gravity of the moment we are living We have voted on sanctions against Russia with a sense of responsibility and we will vote on them again even tomorrow However we must say one thing about this which was a fundamental act to demonstrate the unity of the Western world with Russia These sanctions do not all strike in the same way it is honest to say that Italy pays a higher price than the United States or other European countries pay for example I say this in order to reiterate that solidarity is necessary within Europe and also with the overseas partner on this game otherwise there is the risk that someone thinks that there are A series partners and other B series partners people who pay a high price and someone else who does not pay any I say this also with reference to the decree law on energy which the Government issued a few days ago and which we declared not only late but also very disappointing There are whole sectors and whole chains of the Italian economy that are likely to fail President Draghi We need a new recovery plan dedicated this time to the energy problem of Italy because unfortunately Italian companies are the most exposed to economic retaliation They are the most exposed because of us but I would like to say because of you that you have ruled this country for ten years without having guaranteed economic independence However this is also due to the fact that our economy is based on export On the subject of expensive bills I must remember that authoritative representatives of this Government have shouted at speculation in place but they have forgotten to say who the speculators are and what the Government intends to do to punish them A similar speech applies to the PNRR I am not one of those who entrust to the PNRR who knows what salvific capacities of the economy I recognize it as very important but perhaps there have been too many expectations around it It must be said however that that plan was written in another historical epoch not in this one The invasion of Ukraine has created a very strong discrimination and we must renegotiate it and review it together with the local authorities the Governors the companies that are likely to fail The risk in fact is that the next bans should be deserted that that money will not serve or be insufficient and this would be a failure that the country cannot afford Finally I would like to make a few remarks of a deliberately political or perhaps even controversial nature Mr President in Office of the Council I am speaking on behalf of the Brothers of Italy Group which has been told painted and described by certain lazy intellectual press but I would like to say more simply in bad faith as a sovereignist Group where for certain press for certain mental intelligence or in bad faith this term indicates a kind of concentration of all the negative qualities that a political formation can have I would like to ask my colleagues from the Left the press and intellectuals who teach us what the whole world is discussing these days if not national sovereignty the freedom of countries What do political sovereignty and freedom consist of other than autonomy i.e. military energy and even food sovereignty In the matter of sovereignism a term that we could also replace with others that maybe like them better I would like it to be clear that there was someone who had seen us long As I come to the conclusion I note that yesterday President Zelensky spoke to the House President Draghi said that Italy is in favour of Ukraine joining the European community It is a wish that we make our own It 's a long path and it's the beginning of a positive path Mr Zelensky addressed a European Parliament as a leader Before the institutions the one that unites the Italian people with the Ukrainian people is the common belonging to European culture and civilization That is why we are at the side of the Italian Government and at the side of the Ukrainian people in a battle of freedom which they also fight in our name,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#CirianiLuca,CIRIANI FdI Mr President it would be enough for the Italians to be able to see the debate that has not been held at the Conference of the Leaders and what is taking place now so that they can realize the state of this majority and if it is possible that a reduced majority in these conditions can govern a country struggling with an economic crisis that risks being disastrous and with war at the gates and borders of Europe The theme of these last days was the letter that President Draghi sent to you and through you to the group leaders whom we call diplomatically irritating while others used other adjectives Many of the Members of all the groups have been a little upset because the President of the Council seemed to give homework to Parliament establishing what it should do in what times and in what ways I too am a little concerned and I recognise Mr President that I have always tried to defend the prerogatives of the Senate However after listening to the debate at the Conference of the Leaders and that in this House I am concerned about the emptying of the role of Parliament by not so much the Government but the Parliament itself or better the parliamentary majority that decides to give up discussing the most important issues affecting our national and international communities I would like to give a few examples which we have already heard at the Conference of Leaders We asked for for example one simple thing Thursday was the question time and the presence of Minister Patuanelli Since there is an emergency of swine fever and there is an alarm in Italy about the consequences of its spread which naturally alerts people after two years of pandemics we have proposed to allow the question time so that the Minister can respond not to our concerns but to those of the people who are at home It can not be done the majority has decided this issue which everyone is talking about the Senate must not be concerned The most serious thing is that we are witnessing this theater of hypocrisy staged by the colleagues of the Movimento 5 Stars not alone but certainly first so they say one day yes and the other that it is essential that Prime Minister Draghi report to the Chambers I have here with me a copious press review which concerns only the last two weeks with very heavy quote statements from the major representatives of the Movimento 5 Stars and not only but also from other parties of the left and the majority I quote a few The Premier comes to the Chamber and speaks to the Country or Conte the Chambers must vote on arms When will we vote What are you going to do in addition to this false protest that you have just staged so that the Chambers can vote It is not enough to vote against the timetable to wash one 's conscience What are you going to do to restore the centrality of Parliament so that we can discuss what President Draghi is going to discuss discuss and discuss in Brussels on 30 and 31 May Colleagues do not tell me that this is an informal meeting because informal meetings on such important issues simply do not exist There are no informal meetings when I read from the official website of the European Commission the Heads of State and Government are called to discuss four topics the first is Ukraine the second is energy the third is defence and the fourth is food security Well the Senate of the Republic has decided that all these issues which the whole world is talking about are not affected We are calm because the Minister for relations with Parliament and the Government have reassured us saying that we will talk about this in a month 's time We 'll talk about it in a month Meanwhile nobody knows what will happen in Italy Europe and the world from here to 21 June The urgent need to report to Parliament which is on the news and on the web but here it leaves no trace because you think you deceive us and the Italians simply by voting against the calendar Take on the consequences of what you say and really put the government in crisis on these issues Have the courage to show your muscles Instead you are content with a few words which leave the time they find Here not only is there a legal obligation for the President of the Council to report to the Chambers a legal obligation but there is a huge question of political opportunity On the other hand Parliament has decided to sink itself That is why Mr President I repeat that what I am most concerned about is not the interference of the executive power in the legislative process which is a long standing issue and which perhaps we will not be able to resolve What worries me is the surrender of Parliament and the majority of the government 's will to decide for everyone Even the haste with which President Draghi sent that letter is intended to say to Parliament we urgently need the Senate and the House of Deputies to give us the delegation to decide That draft competition law is in fact essentially in its most important parts a delegation to the Government This is what happens the government tells Parliament that it is urgent to legislate in its place and Parliament decides that it has no interest in discussing the most important issues which concern Italians European citizens and citizens all over the world,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#CirianiLuca,CIRIANI FdI Mr President President Draghi colleagues in the Senate these days but also in the last few hours we have heard dozens perhaps hundreds of times of the call for seriousness and responsibility But I ask myself and ask you what is less serious and less responsible for saying one thing and then making another to invoke consistency and then do exactly the opposite to make consistency in fact rag paper What is less serious and responsible for announcing that only a majority of a certain type will be made and then working to do anything else What is less serious than the spectacle of a majority who has been slapped throughout the general debate and a Senate paralyzed by the fear of the vote and the return to the judgment of the Italians What 's less serious than the show we offered on live television than a Senate divided between ambiguity tricks half votes vote yes vote no suspend make a resolution withdraw etc I really think you 've crossed the line That 's it Let 's pull a line and move on President Draghi we anticipated what happened months ago at the time of the election of the new President of the Republic And we had said and reiterated dozens of times that this majority could not work because it is too contradictory within itself it had explosive contradictions that could not be hidden I want to read President and colleagues of the Senate some of the adjectives with which you have qualified in the last five days and they are adjectives that we have taken from the agencies from the press articles and from the interviews of all the majority groups with all the other majority groups Then you have defined yourselves as irresponsible untrustworthy wretched natural incompatible insane indecent provocative dishonest hypocritical calamities I 'm staying here because I only have ten minutes and I can't use all the time to list all the compliments you 've made But then all of a sudden you came here to the Senate to explain to us that the irresponsible and unreliable together with the wretched and incompatible together with the insane and dishonest provocateurs would all of a sudden work together for the good of Italy What happened Mr President was inevitable but I want to remind you of some very strange and very serious things in my opinion that have happened Among the many ministers who do not vote for the trust of the Government of which they belong Ministers who remain within the Executive despite their party do not vote for the Government of which they belong demonstrations organized by the PD and other left wing parties to claim not the right to vote but the non -right to vote We have seen people who have come to the streets to claim the right not to vote I do n't think it 's ever happened in any country in the free world an almost Orwellian scene if I 'm allowed I would also like to say that I am politically ashamed of what remains of a movement that was to make the revolution and had to break down the caste and become a super caste of powers and privileges I am ashamed of this ship of desperate people who wander from one part of Parliament to another in search of someone who extends their experience in the Senate or in the House for a few months who is willing to vote for anything to keep their place President Draghi this morning we of Brothers of Italy listened to you with the attention of always because we have the respect of the institutions But it was immediately very obvious and it does n't need to be a political commentator that his whole speech was built to please the Democratic Party and the Left not a word in favour of the centre right its concerns and its demands Do you know what hit me the most Its umpteenth because it has already said so before promise to reform the income of citizenship President Draghi among other extravagant things of your majority there is another one that you certainly know there is a party not the largest but one of the noisiest which deposited in the cassation the request for a referendum to repeal the income of citizenship that is a measure that voted one two three four times when it was worth 9 billion 10 billion 11 billion Citizenship income we repeat this concept is discrimination those who believe in citizenship income cannot believe in cutting the tax wedge those who believe in the model of citizenship income cannot believe in the model that we invoke that of responsibility health enterprise commitment sacrifice They 're two worlds that can't be together and you want to keep them together just for power Once again no more lectures We do not put Italy at risk We Italy have it in our heart it is written in our manifestos and in the reason for being Brothers of Italy What is at risk is not Italy but a system of power that the Democratic Party has built since November 2011 when they kicked Berlusconi out of this Parliament Since then this system of power has been stronger and more and more ramified and puts in place all the instruments that it has no one excluded to preserve itself It pains me to see that even in the centre right in Parliament and in the regions there is someone who does not understand the game if you are functional to this system of power you suddenly become intelligent kind sympathetic if instead you fight to assert a different principle an alternative you immediately become stupid and dangerous And that 's enough of the barbarian fake news on the doorstep We have started with responsible people we govern municipalities and regions also very complex and also very advanced We have demonstrated our seriousness in foreign policy as Mr La Russa also said in his speech when we sided with Italy the European Union NATO and Ukraine It could have cost us so much in terms of election but we did it spontaneously because that 's exactly what we think it 's right to do Finally President Draghi I want to tell you something else I do n't know if you 're interested but I really do n't believe in the sincerity of your friends and allies Those who applauded her this morning applauded her only out of fear they were the same ones who boycotted her the day she went up to the Quirinale They are people who praise you in public and betray you in private We do exactly the opposite we are people who say publicly what they think even privately If she succeeds in putting together the pieces of what remains of her majority she does not deceive herself they will come back to fight to make the traps to put her in trouble until the next ambush because they love to play on the skin of Italy Mr President Brothers of Italy certainly as he did not vote for the first trust in the yellow green government failure trust in the second government the yellow red government failed and we had foreseen it confidence in the third rainbow government failed also this will not give you confidence even today And we will do it without tactics with an open face with the clarity and consistency of all time We want to stay away from his false friends from his false allies from the false love of Homeland from the false sense of responsibility from a Parliament dominated by the fear of the vote that thinks only to survive We work for a new government serious strong and also responsible yes responsible because we are serious people and I want to reiterate that But this government is not what the thousand mayors of the Democratic Party decide but it is what millions of Italians decide on election day,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,8.333469,-6.593612,15,ciriani fdi mr

#CirianiLuca,Mr President I do not know if I will use all the time available tomorrow our colleague Isabella Rauti will speak on the explanation of vote on the occasion of trust and there we will also go into detail of the many reasons that push us to this step that we could have avoided but to which you pushed us with your irresponsible conduct I would simply like to remind the House and the few Members that what has happened these days has remained I have read and heard surreal reconstructions of what we have all lived together in the Joint Committees on Foreign Affairs and Defence Unbelievable things have happened but it does not mean that they are positive indeed they are certainly very negative especially for the country that has the misfortune to be administered and governed by a majority that has lost control of itself at such a serious moment in international political life I said that incredible things happen it happens for example that Brothers of Italy present an agenda in the Commission to make a very trivial request The agenda simply repeats things that have already happened repeats quote statements of the President of the Council Draghi on some international commitments that Italy has signed several times in recent years repeats what already contained in a similar agenda approved by a very large majority in the House and simply asks that those commitments that were worth to the House a week before may also apply to the Senate the following week Instead in the turn of the incredible things it happens that the Movimento 5 Stars probably wanted to use our agenda for its political purposes to boycott the majority of which is part The government in fact in the face of such a linear and transparent agenda does the only thing it could do it welcomes it The Government in fact cannot fail to accept an agenda that reflects the historic position of Brothers of Italy which existed before the birth of this Executive and this legislature because it was part of our electoral programme already many years before The Government therefore does one simple trivial thing it accepts the agenda that makes statements on which the Government had already expressed itself positively the week before in the House Of course this is not enough It happens that a former President of the Council of this country in office for three years goes to the current President of the Council whom he at least formally supports and tells him that he does not agree It happens that the President of the Council even addresses the President of the Republic to confirm the line of the country in line with the international commitments entered into The next day however another film is staged that is this childish and ridiculous attempt I repeat childish and ridiculous of the Movimento 5 Stars which convinces the majority which is now in disarray to stage the following brilliant stunt The agenda was accepted by the Government This is history and you can't go back from history However we are clever so we commit ourselves not to go to the House with the rapporteur we ensure that the Commission does not finish its work so think it found it ingenious that it arrives in the Chamber with the old text so that the agenda accepted by the Government no longer exists Magically it does n't exist anymore it never existed it never happened that the government accepted that order a day We therefore have the waltz of hypocrisy the 5 Stars pretend not to know that the rest of the majority is against its positions while the rest of the majority pretends not to know that the relative majority parliamentary force namely the 5 Stars is against what the rest of the majority supports This is the political framework in which we are about to vote for a government that does not have a majority in the matter of foreign policy at the most serious moment in republican history of the last forty years That 's what we 're talking about The tricks the hypocrisies the regulatory games in which you are very good are not enough to hide this simple truth To my five remaining colleagues in this House I would like to say that if they have the courage of their opinions true courage not fake courage they must take paper and pen and write an agenda in which they say we do not recognize ourselves in the statements of President Draghi we do not recognize ourselves in the foreign policy of this Government we do not recognize ourselves as said by the President of the Council in the Chamber They had to say this or they could do something even simpler that is to call their Minister for Foreign Affairs because they express the Minister for Foreign Affairs and say to him dear Minister which side are you on Are you with Dragons or are you with us If as I imagine the Minister for Foreign Affairs is loyally and faithfully consistent with your positions why has he not spoken Why did n't you say what you think How long do we have to wait to know what the Minister of Foreign Affairs thinks about the position of the Movimento 5 Star Group to which he belongs In this context can we as an opposition even remotely imagine voting in favour of a measure which we share on the substance knowing that that vote would give strength to a majority and a government that is irresponsible at a time of utmost seriousness The world observes us looks at us and wonders how it is possible that a country which is in a difficult situation like the rest of the world is governed by a majority that does not have a military policy and a shared foreign policy that betrays the international commitments entered into by the same Government by previous governments and by the same majority Majority in which a gentleman who was the President of the Council sits and now says things opposite to what he said only a year or six months ago This is the majority This is the majority of a government that is called the best but that makes us disfigure internationally That is why we maintain our clarity of positions we maintain our coherence we maintain our willingness to always vote in favour of Italian interests especially when our credibility at international level is at stake but we cannot vote for trust in a government that has behaved in this way,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,10.399698,-4.5856304,15,mr president know use time available tomorrow

#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President first of all I would like to thank the College of Quaestors in the people of Senators Laura Bottici Antonio De Poli and Paolo Arrigoni who presented us with this budget and went through a particularly difficult period like all the staff in the Senate I would like to highlight some aspects of what senior commissioner Antonio De Poli has said about reducing Senate spending over the past few years I will just quote two figures which I want to highlight Over the past ten years Senate spending has increased from 475 million to 445 million euros despite an inflation of 13 During the same period government spending rose from € 794 million to €985 million It is clear that the needs are different and the State has different starting points than the Senate However it is certain that if the State had by far the most unlikely hypothesis observed the same trend we would now have problems placing the primary and secondary surplus of the state budget rather than trying to reduce and buffer the increase in public debt The reduction has been particularly marked in the area of the economic treatment of senators as well as of course in all other sectors I remember that a few years ago we wanted to make people believe and it was also written in the newspapers that the Italian Parliament was the most expensive in the world Here too I quote only one figure among the many namely that the United States Senate which also consists of only 100 senators spends 150 million a year on the direct collaborators of senators and that same item on this budget is less than 16 million When it is said that the Italian Parliament is the most expensive in the world then it is obviously not the truth but I do not insist on the point The reduction in the number of parliamentarians will involve a reorganization starting from the next legislature which must go in the direction that has been tried to pursue in recent years and which has been achieved namely to fully maintain the first function of the Senate which is not to reduce expenditure even if it has been carried out with great consistency in recent years by the quaestors senators but to have an effective legislative activity to be able to listen to the needs of the citizens and to be able to exercise its functions of inspection union or control over the activity of the Government This is the challenge that awaits us every year but in particular with the passage that is about to take place I would like to take the opportunity to join in the thanks but I would like to do anyway despite having already been mentioned to the College of Quaestors to President Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati to Vice President Roberto Calderoli who is a certainty of this Assembly and with him to the whole Council of Presidents to the structure of the Senate starting with Secretary General Elisabetta Serafin to the Vice Secretarys Alfonso Sandomenico and Federico Toniato and to all the staff of the Senate who has always performed his work with great professionalism and punctuality but in recent years because of the pandemic he has had particular difficulties contrary to what has been proposed in some way the Senate has never closed and has continued its activity always without limitations except those dictated by prudence and measures for the containment of the pandemic In this work the Quaestors were particularly active but I would like to mention in particular Dr. Federico Marini the elderly doctor head of the medical structure of the Senate who had great attention and great effectiveness The measures that were implemented here in the Senate before many other structures proved to be very effective as well as the assistance that was given during the stay in this institution to all those who gravitate around the Senate from staff to senators I would also like to give a word to the employees of the Groups to the collaborators of the Groups and to the collaborators of the senators who are people of high professionalism and constant precariousness because at the end of each legislature their working relationships are interrupted sometimes even when there are conditions such as pregnancy and anything else and every time there is a new restart which does not always concern everyone We must pay attention to these figures which are indispensable for the proper functioning of the Senate I therefore conclude my speech by announcing the positive vote of the Brothers of Italy Group on the Report and the Senate 's draft internal budget,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,16.926311,-7.64754,15,mr malan fdi mr president first would like thank college quaestors people senators laura bottici antonio de poli paolo

#MalanLucio,Mr President Mr President in Office of the Government my fellow senators this Conference on the future of Europe is a very curious operation I wonder how many people outside of the staff were really interested in it It has certainly not been an issue of widespread discussion among people and citizens but also among those who are actively involved in politics It was supposed to be an experiment in the exercise of participatory democracy but it showed many shadows and doubts about the reliability of all procedures and the viability of the proposals received and formulated The working methods were to summon 800 citizens chosen by a company specializing in market surveys by a so called random method In other words it is a company specialized in seeing what consumers are looking for in a product in order to make it easier for the products themselves to be sold it is something quite different from coordinating people however chosen at random as they say to formulate proposals that are absolutely political There have not been a lot of complaints and concerns shared by many MEPs national parliamentarians and members of national governments who have also noted a lack of attention to procedures and even the impossibility to verify that the citizens since they are meetings remotely really followed the work One of the interesting things is that although the Italian population is 14 of the population of the European Union only 22 of the 800 participants are Italian i.e. less than 3 Compared with 14 percent of the population less than 3 percent of the participants are Italian Who knows why You do n't know So these 800 participants of which 22 Italians were divided into panels using this term also in the Italian version because apparently the words commission or working group were considered unfit to express the concept in our language These four panels have therefore developed the beauty of 368 proposals called recommendations It is rather difficult to understand how people chosen at random who do not meet physically without voting this is another peculiarity can come up with proposals It is therefore clear that most of the work was done by the organisation whose presidency was under the auspices of the Presidency of the European Commission the Presidency of the European Council and the Presidency of the European Parliament which in turn appointed three representatives one French one Belgian and one Croatian The final approval will always take place without votes so we do not understand how at the plenary session that has yet to be held so the proposals have theoretically not yet been approved although it is clear that these 368 recommendations will be because given the particular mechanisms with which they have already been drawn up they will be approved on Friday and Saturday It is therefore interesting to read these 368 proposals which are all really without excluding one aimed at widening the powers of the European Union or assuming functions that are now national states or local authorities or imposing new constraints new rules and new conditions on citizens and businesses Parliaments and national governments are mentioned very few times and only to say what they must be required to do Let me give some examples among the proposals which end up seeming almost unanimous there are euthanasia marriage regardless of sex and with a curious expression adulthood which I do not quite understand what it means but I hope does not mean what I fear and of course adoption regardless of who forms these families There is a craving to teach European citizens how to think because there are campaigns that rather than information are used to educate citizens to think in a certain way as is explicitly stated We do not think that this is the function of the European Union we believe that it must exploit the extraordinary qualities that the Member States have starting with Italy and not standardize them in an indistinct grayness,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,13.935902,-4.4921446,15,mr president mr president office government fellow senators conference future

#MalanLucio,Mr President on the subject of the technical aspects of the measure Senator Ruspandini will speak for the Brothers of Italy Group during the explanation of vote and has already spoken to Senator De Bertoldi in whose speech I fully acknowledge including the part concerning the verbal assaults of Mr Quartapelle on Mr Meloni I am not going to go into the matter otherwise quite rightly the Presidency would come back to me I want to stress three aspects of the measure It is a delegation to the Government that gives it wide discretion I take the example of the paragraph that has been added in the course of examination in the Commission by which the government is delegated to revise the competences of the national anti-corruption authority in the matter of public contracts which is extremely generic Of course we all hope that it will do it well but I would say that the Government should first of all implement what the law already states in addition to what the delegation requests The law is based among other things on fundamental principles of national and European law such as legality transparency competition and the need not to meet as specifically mentioned infringement proceedings by the European Union which has very precise rules in competition matters and already has a number of times Italy has stumbled into infringement procedures which represent costs as well as a loss of credibility for our nation I give very concrete examples where however these principles are not applied Let 's start with the infringement procedure In 2007 the government tried to extend the Brescia Padova motorway without any reason except to keep the same operator We are talking about an extremely profitable motorway which produces profits that are close to half the income there are practically no other legal sectors where there are such gains The European Union opened a procedure because it said that it was not justifiable to extend an important concession if not accompanied by some strong motivation such as the implementation of a new treaty Great The Executive of the time the second Prodi Government added what reason for the extension of the completion of the Valdastico Nord Motorway to connect Brescia Padova to the Brennero Motorway In the text which was approved in Parliament a clause was also rightly included in order to avoid any failure to comply with what was said and by 30 June 2013 the final complete draft of the new treaty should have been presented Well the project has never been presented and I say never Two months before that deadline in the spring of 2013 a preliminary therefore not definitive project was presented so it could not be built even a centimeter of road I repeat a preliminary draft of one of the two lots of which the highway had to compose Well on the basis of that project a very high executive of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport now also sustainable mobility established that it was satisfied with the provisions of the Convention which instead demanded a completely different thing and therefore the concession was extended until 2026 i.e. for twenty years from the original deadline The even more insane thing is that that decision of the CIPE today CIPESS because it has added sustainable development has been definitively cancelled by the Council of State In other words it was extended until 2026 and this was the case in 2018 the concession for a motorway with profits of about one hundred million per year all paid by motorists certainly not raining from the sky on the basis of a document totally unfit to satisfy what the law approved in Parliament provided a document that was definitively cancelled by the Council of State The interested parties i.e. the management of the motorway which happened in the meantime to have ended up under the heel of Atlantia Benetton they are obviously among the needy to whom the Government must make gifts have lodged an appeal in Cassation against the annulment of the Council of State that the Cassation rejected by charging the expenses I have tabled a number of questions on this and the Government has never answered them I would remind you that we are talking here about transparency and that answering questions is the duty of the Government not a kind faculty that is exercised once in a while when someone insists just read the Rules of Procedure of the Senate which obviously is similar to that of the other branch of Parliament I wonder where transparency is in this case with a substantially and materially changed concession in its content without even informing Parliament even when requested even though it was passed by law Where then are transparency and legality Speaking of legality who is that executive who kindly approved this gift to the poor Atlantia Benetton I do n't name it because it's not a personal matter it 's definitely a good person but it 's doing things that have nothing to do with the law The anti-corruption law which is the one establishing the National Anti-corruption Authority ANAC whose powers are changed through a delegation to the Government by the draft law under consideration provides that there is a rotation in all positions of the public administration that may be subject to danger of corruption A gentleman who with a signature can move hundreds and hundreds of millions of euros here or there should probably be subject to rotation This gentleman has always been in the same sector since 1997 that of motorway concessions and he does things like the one I 've illustrated All this has been the subject of questions to which no answer has ever been given This same leader who continues to stand there against the anti-corruption law since the last century it has a certain effect to think of it and in the century that has just begun he has also done something else always in the name of legality and correctness We know well that the restaurant for companies damaged by the pandemic by Covid 19 works in this way there must have been a reduction of at least 33 of the turnover the refreshment can not exceed 20 of the turnover itself and 10 if you are above a certain percentage of turnover Therefore the share is between 10 and 20 percent if there has been a 33 reduction Thousands of companies have failed because these measures have proved to be insufficient in many cases well the manager himself who against the anti-corruption law has been for twenty five years in this area a little delicate and above all from the high economic and financial value has decided after consulting the interested that is the beneficiaries that the highway dealers are given a refreshment of 100 percent even if there is not a reduction of the turnover that reaches 33 percent that happens is exactly what happens with Autostrade for Italy of Atlantia Benetton There would be a lot more to say but I only have ten minutes These events have been going on for years on which the Government does not respond regularly to questions The Government which receives a delegation to pass laws which as they should of course already do protect legality transparency and competition and prevent infringement procedures by the European Union begin to do so long before the text is drafted on which it was rightly hoped that if there should be a text it should be done quickly it would respect the law respond to the question and if it should make gifts do it to the people who need it and not to the billionaires who have very serious responsibilities on conscience as in the collapse of the Morandi bridge just as the judiciary has been ascertaining in recent months,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,13.871844,-10.183405,15,mr president subject

#UrsoAdolfo,Mr Urso FdI Mr President this opportunity was also expressed by the Republic 's Parliamentary Security Committee in its annual report to Parliament presented on 9 February precisely because during the work carried out last year we had seen this interest in several hearings by those who are at the forefront of combating money laundering We speak specifically of the hearings held by the president of the Italian Banking Association Patuelli the general commander of the Zafarana Finance Guard and the offices in charge of the Bank of Italy That is why and we have taken this into account in Parliament we discussed it with the Franco Minister for Economic Affairs during his hearing We also count on this in the motion of Brothers of Italy aware like you of how important it is to make our country obtain the seat of the nascent European Authority and of how our country rightly has this ambition because it does not yet have an authority in the economic and financial field The economic and financial authorities are in Frankfurt Paris Madrid and outside the European Union Basel All the other major capitals of our European Union already have the seat of an economic and financial authority all except Italy On the merits it is clear to everyone that Italy and we say this each of us in the respective motions presented by the parliamentary groups has developed at the same time a particular legislation to combat money laundering which is also experienced in the field legislation that derives from the fact that our country first had to deal with the issue and did so thanks to the foresight of our hero judges Livatino Borsellino Falcone who indicated before others already at the end of the eighties how important it was to follow the trace of money to counter the money laundering of the great criminal organizations For this reason Italy has developed first and better than others legislation to combat this phenomenon which is then carried out in the field activities the phenomenon according to European data which would cover at least 1 of the gross domestic product of the European Union From this we must start to claim the seat and at the same time we must be aware that the issue today is even more important than in the past And it is for technological development which has allowed for the integration of financial flows It is because in the meantime this has also led through cybernetic activity linked to financial activity to the creation of virtual currencies and therefore also cryptocurrencies which are the instrument used by international groups criminals terrorists and not only And this has now highlighted the global nature of the criminal and terrorist groups we think of the extortion carried out also thanks to the cryptocurrencies we think and I conclude of how important the sanctioning regime in the tax field is that the systems the regimes or better still the rogue states try to circumvent through the cryptocurrencies or money laundering We are aware of how difficult the game is because now in the European negotiation a blocking union has emerged that makes it difficult to assert the right of our country to obtain the seat of that Authority in the substance But I think we owe it to heroic judges Paolo Borsellino and Falcone I hope that the seat of the Authority in whatever city in Italy is located will then have a street or a square where the Authority itself is located dedicated precisely to those who have taught us and Europe the road to pursue in order to fight through money laundering the major crimes organized at international level,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,13.420419,-6.160623,15,mr urso fdi mr president opportunity also expressed republic 's

#IwobiTonyChike,Mr President ladies and gentlemen the Conference on the future of Europe has been a time for debate that has been desired and requested for several years to bring proposals from below with a view to improving and modifying the functioning of Europe which has not been reflected for a number of reasons Surely the pandemic has further removed the possibilities of encounters of carrying out physical events and has helped to divert the tension of the path of the Conference However it is certain that the poor result achieved reflects a perception of the distance of European citizens towards the European institutions sometimes seen more as a castle of bureaucrats than as representatives of the people at the service of all European citizens I will concentrate briefly on three issues European democracy foreign policy and defence work First of all it is clear that the intergovernmental mechanism of the European institution still clearly prevails over the supranational identity of the European Union The common perception is that since the last amendment of the Treaties more steps have been taken back than steps forward That is why as a parliamentary group we have often stressed the importance of structural reforms in the Union in the various documents we have produced over the last few years It is necessary to find the courage to sit at the table and amend the Treaties in order to arrive at a European Union that will defeat its democratic deficit and address those socio- economic issues which if unresolved will continue to remain a factor of political division That is also why we have called for and continue to call for a greater role for the European Parliament the only true representative body since it is directly elected by the citizens It is unacceptable that the European Parliament should not have the power of legislative initiative but only the power of proposal The high rate of abstention during the European elections is a warning bell that has been ringing for decades and has not yet found sufficient answers from the European institutions The European Union must be the cradle of popular participation and not an institution that further alienates citizens from politics We also need to rethink the role of the European Commission the true decision making body of the future of the Union moving towards a path that changes the elections of the President of the Commission and truly makes the Commission accountable to the European Parliament it is essential in order to improve the functioning of the Union to bring it closer to the citizens The same applies to the transparency and publicity of the work of certain European interministerial meetings such as the Ecofin We have often talked about this in this House and as a group we have raised the problem of the famous secrecy constraints that accompany certain fundamental economic and monetary decisions These are elements that do not contribute to the democratization of the Union and we are sure that the founding fathers of the European project would not have been thrilled to know how much the current bureaucratic apparatus of the Union is so different from the original dream With regard to the external dimension of the European Union which has often been discussed in the Foreign Commission there are clear fears from the ideas and ideas emerging from the Conference about the lack of geopolitical role of the European Union Europe is unable to carry out any deterrent and mediation activity in relation to global issues whether they be economic or security issues And this is the case despite the fact that the European continent continues to be one of the world 's major economies and demographys The reasons for this lack are different and would require a long and in depth debate from slow decisions of vital importance to different geopolitical views and interests between Member States through a lack of strategic coherence that prevents Europe from feeling like a global actor We have often seen the European Union trying to punish or threaten its own Member States in legal terms let us think about the case of Hungary and Poland and forgetting the serious security dangers that face our continent As far as relations with the outside world are concerned the work of the Conference reveals the desire to establish greater cooperation and dialogue with African counterparts I personally welcome this will with great pleasure Over the course of these years we have worked hard on every measure to bring the issues to light on all we have highlighted the importance of a structural project such as the one relating to the fight against the drying up of Lake Chad a water basin that supports the economy of the whole Sahel Investing as a European Union in such a project literally means saving the future of tens of millions of people and allowing them to live in their own country Africa is a demographically young continent facing structural problems that limit its economic development The decision to cooperate with the African continent as the European Union is crucial in many respects It means giving the future to millions of people who want to live in their country to contribute to their growth It means preventing land depopulation stopping the bleeding of human beings that is a disaster for Africa 's future It means dealing with immigration a priori not only by preventing the departure by coercive methods but also by offering prospects for development It means countering the great interference of one of the present global and territorial powers on the Continent with all the strategic dangers arising from the excessive penetration of this power into our southern borders Finally it means dealing with security a stronger Africa is a deterrent to the development of jihadist terrorism which feeds on poverty and illusions There Italy must play a primary role and remind European partners of the importance of the southern borders and the relationship with the African continent and build a leadership within the European Union based on our diplomatic network that the whole world envies us Finally a brief mention is made of the issue of labour on which I believe it is necessary to achieve an overall strategy in Europe which can balance the protection of workers with the needs of the labour market and economic development For this reason it will be essential to start a path to significantly reduce the tax dumping of our country and of the member countries to counter relocation focused on labour costs alone to stimulate the research and development of the enterprises to generate employment and to raise the level of competitiveness of the Union compared to global competitors In conclusion Mr President I expect the final act of the Conference to be a starting point for reaching an act of courage from the Member States and the European institutions for a response that can fill the immobilisation that has occurred in Europe in recent years and that perhaps before the pandemic and now the war is awakening PRESIDENT The debate is closed He 's enlisted to speak Senator

#RautiIsabella,RAUTI FdI I would like to briefly explain our abstention vote in relation to the timetable that we are about to vote on I recall that last week Brothers of Italy during the joint hearing at the Defense Commissions of the Chamber and Senate in the presence of Minister Guerini had already asked for an information from President Draghi We have done so because the full mandate that Parliament has given I am referring to the decree laws of Ukraine one and two also provided for a continuous and constant updating of Parliament So by virtue of this we were among the first to ask for information Subsequently the President as has been mentioned by his colleagues indicated the date of 19 for a question time and in the meantime important meetings are taking place concerning the visit of President Draghi and his meeting with President Biden I would therefore like to give our reasons for abstaining on the request to amend the timetable put forward by Mr Crucioli who is about to be put to the vote This request for a hearing of Ministers is somehow understood and surpassed by the question time already scheduled so I am making it a matter of method and not of merit of course However I would also like to say that we hope that the Brothers of Italy just proposed in the Conference of the Leaders will be welcomed that is that the question time already scheduled can be transformed into an information because this would allow us to have longer times of confrontation on a topic that surely represents the emergency among emergencies With regard to this we are abstaining also on the basis of what was requested at the Conference of the Leaders and we are clearly waiting for a response from Prime Minister Draghi,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,9.94161,-10.138643,15,rauti fdi would like briefly explain abstention vote relation timetable vote recall last week brothers italy joint hearing defense commissions chamber senate presence minister guerini already asked information president draghi done full mandate parliament given referring decree laws ukraine one two also provided continuous constant updating parliament virtue among first ask information subsequently president mentioned colleagues indicated date 19 question time meantime important meetings taking place concerning visit president draghi meeting president biden would therefore like give reasons abstaining request amend timetable put forward mr crucioli put vote request hearing ministers somehow understood surpassed question time already scheduled making matter method merit course however would also like say hope brothers italy proposed conference leaders welcomed question time already scheduled transformed information would allow us longer times confrontation topic surely represents emergency among emergencies regard abstaining also basis requested conference leaders clearly waiting response prime minister draghi
#RautiIsabella,Mr President the Conference on the future of Europe was proposed in 2019 and should have started work on 9 May 2020 but due to the pandemic it was postponed until 9 May 2021 His work lasted a year and should be concluded on 9 May next on the 72nd anniversary of the Schuman Declaration the declaration by the then French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman who proposed on 9 May 1950 the creation of a European Coal and Steel Community whose members would have combined coal and steel production I remember this because today this anniversary has a certain effect if we contextualize it and if we think about the crucial and emerging issue that Europe is Italy are facing that is the energy supply the exit from dependence on Russian gas and oil and that of founding the premises for a necessary autonomy for an ecological transition as well as for the use of renewable energies Let us return to the Conference which should have relaunched the European project involving European citizens and civil society and which as Mr Malan recalled is organised by the three main European institutions the Commission Parliament and the Council and is coordinated by an Executive Committee In short the intention would be as we read in the documents relating to the Conference that I went to see a unique opportunity to reason on the challenges and priorities of Europe as we always read on the site through a mechanism of plenarys and working groups I also went to check the number of meetings There have already been six of them although the first were before the Russian invasion of Ukraine After this date the world has changed the geopolitical structure is changing and I imagine that this has also affected the work of the Conference The next plenary will be at the end of April and the final work as mentioned will take place on 9 May The Conference 's plenary sessions discuss the recommendations made by the national panels of European countries and citizens and the contributions collected by the multilingual digital platform This digital platform would be the backbone of the Conference which as Mr Malan recalled is an experiment of participatory democracy Beautiful as an idea it is a pity that the numbers of participation in the method and also in the merit of contributions are a bit tristanzuoli and make us raise doubts and doubts When the Conference concludes its work on 9 May the Council the Commission and Parliament will receive the recommendations contained in a report some of which I stress contain clear indications of the need to revise the founding Treaties of the European Union I would like to remind you that the last revision in this area dates back to 2007 with the signing of the Lisbon Treaty But the point is that Brussels will have to choose whether to follow up the proposals of the citizens or whether to interpret the final common document as a sort of indicative direction of work hence basically a useless thing without affecting either the Treaties or the structure of the European Union at this point let me say betraying the confidence of the citizens In essence there are many legitimate doubts about the outcome of the Conference that unique opportunity would become perhaps already a wasted opportunity There are also doubts about the method of work the representativeness and the sample of delegates the national citizens panels only six Member States in fact have set up them and other doubts about which Mr Malan spoke I add further doubts and concerns as our colleague Carlo Fidanza MEP of the Group of European Conservatives and Reformists has done in Brussels who has asked to know the costs without having answered his question what budgets have been used and what costs are planned in the end It is already estimated that the Commission has spent EUR 22 million and Parliament EUR 1.2 million and we could continue Then there is a doubt as to the effectiveness of participatory democracy how the whole Conference was organized and also how all proposals for reform of the Treaties will not be taken into account This means that there is a risk that this unique opportunity will eventually become a lost even wasted opportunity I am also referring to what was recently said in an interview by President Giorgia Meloni the Conference on the future of Europe often called with emphasis unfortunately risks being a great opportunity lost because it brings with it a vice of origin a pre-packaged result endorsed by a few hundred willing and respectable citizens but certainly excuse me ladies and gentlemen they cannot represent 450 million Europeans We must then have the courage to look at reality and call things by their name As Mr Malan said there is a risk of imposing a single thought Once again a fundamental choice has been made and this is an expression that I have already used in this House a long time ago what does Europe want to do when it grows up This was a good opportunity to understand it because we must always distinguish between function mission and identity That is what Europe needs to question We have our own model of Europe as illustrated in our motion a confederation of sovereign national states Europe should ask the peoples the Member States but above all the citizens if they think it is more interesting to know for example what they must eat or not

#RautiIsabella,"Mr President Mr President in Office of the Council ladies and gentlemen today after five days of psychological thrillers the orchestra of appellism as it has been defined has finally arrived the day that should clarify Italy 's political destiny The first part of your communications Mr President has been straightforward because you have finally explained the reasons for your resignation for a choice that you have called distressed and due He also said and I quote this because it is important that a President who did not appear to the Italians needs a strong majority exactly what you Mr President do not have So we can only agree and that is why the Brothers of Italy Group not from today but from the beginning of this tortured legislature which has already seen three governments with today I would say three and a half governments not an expression of a popular mandate asks to return to the polls We have been asking for this since the beginning of this parliamentary term in order to have a strong political and popular mandate from the Italians and even more so today Mr President because you have a majority which is weaker and more divided than a week ago when you decided to resign Today in this House to this contradictory majority of itss which I would call its main weakness it has asked I quote again to reconstruct from the outset It does n't show which glue you believe if you really believe it that you can rebuild your government from scratch In fact in the second and third parts of your communications you have had you give me the expression a bad word for everyone that is a direct stocking to every force of the present government Of course there are also children and stepchildren there because he has mened more the League and the Movimento 5 Stars while he has pampered the PD That 's not new Of course you Mr President with your speech and your communications have taken a few pebbles off your shoes but in this way you have also delegitimized your current Executive When you listed we listened carefully the key points of the government programme in order to rebuild what you called pact what you missed you spoke about the deadlines of the PNRR tax reform social agenda support for Ukraine and more You have listed a whole series of points which are not those which your present majority has put before you these days and you have also asked this House essentially for full powers You also know that with regard to some of the points of your government programme cross vetoes will soon arrive I think for example of the fourth decree of support for Ukraine you know what I mean I think of the reform of the land register that the League does not share and we could continue You Mr President more than a government program with a vision to pull a few months seemed to have wanted to draw an electoral program with which you could come to the elections and submit to the Italians judgment Then I come to another very important point because you have argued and stressed that you have been very impressed by a kind of epidemic induced by appeals to remain that has spread over the last three days He mentioned them thanked them speaking precisely of civil society and of undeserved support that would give them associations schools universities the world of the economy the world of journalism mayors I also remember that these are 2,000 mayors out of 8,000 and I do not think I have read an appeal from the regional Governors or perhaps I have distracted myself He concluded by saying in some way delegitimizing Parliament itself that you remain because the Italians ask you to do so Then why do n't we ask the Italians Why do n't you ask the Italians what they think Or maybe the political thermometer polls are worth it which do n't say exactly what you came to tell us But ask the Italians ask the Italians how they do it in democratic systems they are called elections and they are not exactly an apocalypse It is not a question of letters but it is a way of expressing consensus political judgment and liking because it is worth remembering at this point sovereignty belongs to the people who express themselves by voting and elections She remains therefore because the Italians would ask her but she does not ask the Italians it is strange Then of course it remains I forgot because Europe asks it like everything else of course Europe itself but when you vote in other countries because you vote in other countries even before the deadline if it is necessary does not allow interference before the vote The vote is analyzed the next day in the case of Italy we are told who should be running whether you should vote or not to vote In short Europe wants to tell us everything and we that is you also thank you for these advices So Mr President that Europe that asks you to remain is the same Europe that does not want to share for example our request to put a roof at the price of gas So when we say Europe we say a lot of other things but we move on An intelligent journalist and fine political analyst like Antonio Padellaro therefore above all suspicion in a recent interview with Libero said that in the success of Giorgia Meloni and Fratelli d'Italia electoral success among other things recorded in the various rounds that have been there since 2018 and estimated in the polls that would make Brothers of Italy the first party he reads the symbol of the ransom of parliamentary democracy a revolt against the hypothesis of a Draghi-a I suggest you read this article Do you not think therefore that in addition to the letters of support Italy is different and it is also another Well we believe it because we know it and we meet it every day that Italy there The problem is that that Italy you have taken hostage with your quarrels and your begas of the Palace and you insist on dragging a legislature only for logic of electoral survival and for some important state nominations If in today 's day after all this everything were to remain as it is well then you joked while you created a collective suggestion that the vote would trigger the Apocalypse and it is not so So Mr President since let us remember there is always a government in office that can run the ordinary administration so there is no need to make psychological terrorism let us also say that you want to prevent elections because you are afraid of the judgment of the people and the outcome of the elections You do n't understand how in a few months you could solve all the problems that the Government of the Best has n't solved and dealt with in a year and a half I should like to conclude and I would also like to put it mildly ladies and gentlemen We 've discovered an unsuspecting ironic vein in you President Draghi In the foreign press conference you told a delightful joke about heart transplant saying that it would be better to choose the heart of an 80 year old banker than a young heart because that banker the heart never used it great laughs from the press She certainly knows the bankers so maybe she did n't even joke we do n't know if it was irony or self irony Then allow me to make a joke and that is what I shall conclude in this House now almost depopulated despite the importance of the subject Colleagues I want to draw your attention you will all remember that memorable movie by Scola played by Alberto Sordi and Nino Manfredi entitled Will our heroes be able to find the mysteriously deceased friend in Africa The film ends with the unforgettable Titì nun lascià you will all remember Titino in the end what did he do He jumped off the boat did not return to Italy and responded to the call because in the meantime Titino had become the sorcerer of that indigenous village Mr President ladies and gentlemen irony aside Brothers of Italy expect a leap of pride from Mario Draghi so his resignation confirmed and not a Draghi bis that if there is will be even paler and weaker than that begun in February 2021 In short the scenarios change but the fateful and not lucky whatever it takes by Mario Draghi remains It is a at any cost that however does not resemble forgive me neither courage nor a healthy obstinacy it is very similar to the therapeutic aggression of all those political forces that are afraid to face the elections and that in order to keep you as a guarantee of their positions of power have blocked the way to the Quirinale yesterday and today want to block the path of the elections and the judgment of the

#FaggiAntonella,Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to begin by thanking first of all those who have spoken before me who have also pointed out certain parts of this measure which is very important However I must point out the scarcity of those present when we talk about the National Resistance and Resilience Plan which we invoke every day as a tool for Italy 's recovery a maximum attention should be paid instead I focus this speech on two fundamental assessments that I have had the opportunity to make in the last few days even quite frantic thanking first of all the Commissions the 1st and the 7th who have worked hard and in general the whole of Parliament in a cross-cutting way It is clear that the political assessments made on the issues and issues of the National Resilience and Resistance Plan often have political convergence so all the members of Parliament agree on amendments proposals and what needs to be done It 's the same with the ministries Unfortunately however after the two realities have to be joined together there is the pulling off The whole of Parliament apart from colour and belongings strongly calls for amendments to be put forward which can in some way simplify and move in the direction of implementing this important instrument which is also being asked of us by Europe And here the Ministries once one once the other do not find convergence or the opposite happens with the Ministries that endorse the amendment and the parties that agree but the Government does not agree This is a way that is not good It is not good because we are at the end of this very difficult and complex legislature which has seen us participate in situations that are out of the ordinary from the pandemic to the war Now we have in our hands an instrument that we should all use well so that we can really take that path of regrowth of real openness that we are asked for On the contrary the same situation is repeated all the time the amendments are proposed with one and this is all the more true in this particular case very strong convergence on the part of all parties but only one party has been maintained And those amendments that have been retained have value but there were so many that could have led to so called simplification and deburocratisation Unfortunately they could not be maintained And let 's not analyze why but basically the reason is the following if it's not the Ministry it 's the Government if it's not the Government it 's the Ministry In the end this Parliament which is a legislator finds itself on the ground And when the territory asks us to account for why we have not been able to bring the amendments we stand by This Parliament is not capable of giving explanations He cannot explain why even if it is a Parliament that legislates he practically has the card but he does not have the pencil or he has the pencil and not the card And that 's too bad This is the first point I wanted to make Here we are talking about the National Plan we are talking about billions and debt for the future of our children So maybe it 's time to make a turnaround too I would like to say this with all due respect for the Government but this is a Parliament of people elected and deserves respect Every now and then try to listen to and welcome what comes from us because we are bearers of the interests of Italians and not personal There are quite positive measures I am referring for example to local authorities who are the ones who will then have to implement the National Plan and have more difficulties I am referring above all to the small municipalities those who have not been able to undertake the recruitment process and have asked to have at least the opportunity to make the detachment in order to be able to help one another No this could n't be done Yet especially the smaller municipalities of the South where there is the greatest amount of money they will find themselves unable to help each other Something has passed but with respect to the total installation the local authorities responsible for the implementation of this remain on the stake And paradoxically they remain at the stake on the National Plan which is what Europe is asking of us because we must respect it The European recommendations are also important but we are full of infringements since over the last 20 years we have not taken on a number of recommendations The recommendations are important but it is equally important for the government to sit at a European table and say that each state has its own peculiarities and particularities If recommendations mow half of the amendments that can implement the PNRR that Europe itself tells us to implement it is clear that we are facing a dog that bites its tail and becomes ridiculous in front of a Europe that is a step forward Let us not ask ourselves then why the ballot boxes are empty and why there is so much distance We who are Members of the European Parliament are trying to lighten up and unravel with this measure we are bringing things home with great effort from the Commissions but also with a series of obstacles that today which we are trying to open up are ridiculous This is the process that must be overcome In fact if you do not overcome the process of interference and closure you will never be able to really make a change and be concrete There will always be the Ministry the Minister or those who do not want and will not be able to achieve the goal However we are not joking about this because as my colleague said earlier we have to think about who will come after us The children and grandchildren whom we also have will be those on whom the difficulties we encounter every day will fall and who have not had the ability I speak of all to overcome And this is not about amendment 6.5 but about the procedure and the ability to be innovative and adapt to the times This means looking for a different rhythm that rhythm that we have not yet found,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,8.677077,-8.98699,15,mr president ladies gentlemen

#CasolatiMarzia,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen representative of the Government we are debating and approving three important acts relating to the relationship between our country and the European institutions Allow me as an introduction to reiterate that as is also certified by the results of the work of the Conference on the future of the Union people have a strong feeling of distance from the European institutions The lack of representativeness of national parliaments and the lack of involvement of national parliaments in the European decision making process leads to apathy among voters which is reflected in abstention and then in disinterest in what is happening in Brussels but not only Given that the impact of decisions taken in Europe on our future and on our industrial and employment systems is becoming increasingly apparent and I quote for example the approval of the various plans for ecological transition and the declared objectives of climate neutrality it is essential to draw proper attention to discussions such as today's In this regard I would like to stress that Italy must be more incisive in the ascending phase practically as the countries of Northern Europe did when they pushed to impose disposable cellulose as opposed to plastic of which we are the first producers at European level but also excluding bioplastics On the basis of the European delegation law I would like to stress the commitment made by the Government and I thank you on a subject which is very dear to me through the approval in the Commission of an agenda of the League at my first signature This is the commitment to create an independent national institution for the protection and promotion of human rights through the establishment of a specific body with the aim of protecting the fundamental rights recognised by the Italian Constitution and by the international conventions to which Italy is a party It is a body that is able to work in close collaboration with international bodies responsible for the protection of human rights and with other counterparts established by other States thus increasing the capacity for diplomatic cooperation of our country a body that is able to make continuous contact with civil society and with non-governmental organisations associations foundations and the realities of volunteering It is important that this body should have among its aims to monitor respect for human rights in Italy with a view to preventing possible violations to monitor respect for the freedom and dignity of persons with particular attention to women and children in digital society to verify and promote the effective implementation on national territory of international human rights conventions and agreements ratified by Italy to receive and evaluate reports of violations or limitations including violations perpetrated on the Internet to draw up recommendations and opinions to be sent to the Government and the Chambers on issues related to respect for human rights to promote the culture and teaching of these digital education as well as the dissemination of knowledge of protection tools including through information initiatives and awareness raising of the public Mr President I am sorry but there is too much chaos Article 10 which delegates to the Government the adaptation to the regulation on official controls on organic production and labelling as well as the transversality of these controls which cover the whole agri -food chain from food to animal feed How can we fail to stress the European abomination of nutrition score and the need to fight Italian soiling in any way Very important article 15 it is never as important as today to check that terrorist content is not disseminated on the web It is certain however that terrorism does not only travel online on the contrary Surely the continuous landing of illegal immigrants on our coasts does not help to prevent any acts of terrorism in Europe demonstration of this is the fact that several perpetrators of attacks had landed illegally in our country and had stayed there Minister Lamorgese 26,652 landings in six months are too many if you will understand Even if only 0.01 percent of the illegals were a terrorist the damage would be from our point of view irreparable Turning to the important document on Italian participation in the European Union in 2022 I would like to highlight the excellent work done in the Commission which has allowed us to reach the approval of an important report that balances well the wishes expressed by the European plans with the economic working and industrial interests of our country especially with regard to environmental issues I would like to focus on a passage which is particularly close to my heart and which I have emphasized in other speeches on the development of infrastructure In the document we see the desire to propose our country as a new hub for energy supply moving the centre of gravity of European energy policies to the south and expanding our network of relations with the Mediterranean countries Making Italy a platform of this magnitude requires interventions and development of infrastructure networks and consequently we need to change some attitudes that we have witnessed in recent years by some political leaders The opposition to any form of investment on the territory that concerned the creation and development of new infrastructures often disguised by instrumental environmental claims has prevented our country from being in step with the main world economies Therefore it is important to return to the discussion of the trans European transport network programme TEN T and I am pleased to read in the document approved in the Commission the desire to resume this speech especially with regard to infrastructures which have a strategic impact on our territory The policies of no to everything as evidenced by the serious energy crisis that we are experiencing have not held up the confrontation with history We reverse this trend we focus on the development of infrastructures that can make our country integrated with the European economic fabric and we imagine together an Italy that invests in development and looks to the future",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,15.378156,-3.8694057,15,"mr president ladies gentlemen representative

#FazzolariGiovanbattista,FAZZOLARI FdI Mr President with the law of European delegation we are voting in fact on a number of acts first of all the customary delegation to the Government to adapt the Italian system to the European one It is the so called law that Europe asks for but it would also be an opportunity to tidy up some points one of which Brothers of Italy has tried concerns the resolution of the misunderstanding of the incorrect interpretation in Italy of the Bolkestein directive On bathing concessions it was clear and clear that even in the case of concessions of public property goods a directive aimed at the granting of services does not apply The law of European delegation was precisely an opportunity to clarify and resolve this misunderstanding It is regrettable that this Parliament and the Government have decided to pretend nothing once again confirming that the European hat is more and more a valid pretext for making Italians pass and digest all those rules for which the Government does not want to take responsibility for choice and gives it to Europe it is the fault of Europe No it 's the government 's fault on the bathing concessions In addition to the final report the very important document is the programmatic report in which the government basically explains how it wants to be in Europe in the coming months and what it would like to do in the context of the European Union However we find ourselves systematically with completely empty documents without any content without any vision Let me say that the motion for a majority resolution is very sorry I wonder if the so called government of the best or the majority of the best in which they are all the best can put forward a motion for a resolution stating something like this we have read the document that 's fine but next time maybe show us before so at least we study it I wonder if it was not appropriate to give an address that someone would say something in short even proforma Brothers of Italy presented its resolution a little more contentful Of course if we had to talk about Europe we could have written manuals Very concretely really can we say that the line of Italy in the European Union is to say that everything is fine we keep this course and put in our documents some attention to the contour We say no it 's not okay This model of European integration is not working and is creating serious problems Every time facts and history knock on the door of European bureaucrats trying to explain to them that there is something that should be changed Brothers of Italy as we know is part of the family of European conservatives We have the privilege of having Giorgia Meloni president of the Party of European Conservatives and Reformists and we have always done a very clear battle on what the line of integration for the continent should be By now the European narrative has focused the story as if there were two positions the Europeanists or if we want the most Europeanists those who would like to continue on this path and those who would like to destroy Europe This is a lie which does not reflect the history of European integration in which confederal thinking has always had full citizenship which is precisely what characterizes conservative thinking in Europe that is to say that states must maintain their sovereignty as regards the legislation of proximity that is that it concerns the daily life of their citizens and their businesses whereas the Union must instead address the great challenges of history that every single European State cannot face alone This seems like a vision of common sense and we did n't make it up so much so that characters far more illustrious than we have explained it very well in the past from De Gaulle to Churchill and many others Then the facts come to confirm that the current model of European integration does not work first the economic crises from 2008 onwards to bear witness that Europe was not ready then the pandemic in which we realized that uncontrolled globalisation that the European Union did not master had created value chains so long that Europe did not have the supply of the elements essential to its survival In fact we discovered with the pandemic that all the active ingredients of our medicines even if bearing the brand of a European country are mainly produced in India and we wake up realizing that we are fragile Then came the war which showed us a further fragility the energy fragility and even there we woke up late Maybe we will find a different opportunity to explain it better but really someone can believe that this situation at our borders is not closely linked to the standing that Germany has chosen for the European Union with a system now of the European Union that provides for the supply of cheap raw materials from Russia cheap labour from Eastern Europe added value created by the German industries that invade Western and global markets Of course there is a situation of instability in which you make the Russian supply vital for you and so Russia believes that it is in the right to exercise a will of power over its neighbours but this is a complex speech that perhaps deserved a discussion these days instead of the desolation we have seen Always with a model that we pretend works the European Union becomes a sort of entity that sticks the Member States but with little impartiality The examples would be endless but in these days two come to mind The first concerns the situation with regard to immigration How many times have we heard Poland and the Visegrad countries attack how inhuman they are towards immigration We have also seen this recently despite the fact that they have welcomed Ukrainian refugees as true Europeans on their land All this however clashes with the silence that we have heard in recent days regarding what happened in Melilla 23 deaths among migrants trying to cross the border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla The government is socialist and there has been the total silence of the European institutions and the total silence of this House What would have happened if 23 people had died on the border with Poland Instead the President of the European Council Michel has declared full support for Spain for the protection of European borders These are the double standards that characterise the European Union A second example is France which denies the extradition of ten terrorists of the red brigades in Italy and does so these are the anticipations because the right trial is not guaranteed in Italy France therefore states that in Italy the right trial is not guaranteed and therefore does not allow the extradition of terrorists Imagine what would have happened if the Czech Republic for example had not extradited ten terrorists to Germany I wonder if this would have been accepted in the same way I hope that this House will remember this French attitude on Tuesday when the ratification of the Quirinale Treaty between France and Italy comes to this House This model of the European Union is not ours for us Europe is a historic reality made up of people who have the same roots and culture and who have the same destiny not an exclusive club in which you choose who can and who does not,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,14.757538,-10.369969,15,fazzolari

#BalboniAlberto,Balboni FdI Mr President the Senate Assembly is about to finally adopt a wrong regressive certainly useless Senator Renzi but also harmful if you will allow me Italian justice in fact and the vast majority of Italian magistrates who love their work and perform the high function they are called with great commitment and professionalism deserved much more This law does n't even affect the power of currents in the CSM In fact it introduces an electoral system that enhances their contractual power and makes them even stronger The only way to cut at the root this shameful degeneration of the albeit legitimate and proper democratic pluralism which demeans all the honest magistrates and disconcerts all the Italians would be the temperate draw as honestly recognized by lawyers distinguished and free as Nordio and Gratteri and as proposed also by Brothers of Italy with our amendments obviously all rejected by a deaf and indifferent Chamber Moreover a Parliament that cuts 37 of its members in the name of savings and at the same time increases the members of the MSC by 25 in addition to having more than doubled the staff that can be hired with collaboration contracts demonstrates all its subdiction to the power of those same currents which in words and only in words someone who then withdraws the amendments in this House says he wants to fight This law of yours moreover hardly touches on the controversial phenomenon of the so called revolving doors between the judiciary and politics ignoring that when a magistrate is running for election and the same reasoning applies even when he assumes positions of government that are political in nature he is forever stripped of impartiality which is the very essence of his high function regardless of whether he is then elected or not Those who take sides with a party dear Minister must no longer return to judicial functions if you really care about the good reputation of the judiciary This is the view of the citizens who are entitled to be judged by a judge not only impartial but who also appears to be so as Caesar 's wife Of course you have also rejected all our amendments on this point This law of yours does not even address the issue of out of role magistrates which today are as many as 200 in addition to 20 administrative magistrates limiting itself to a general and indeterminate commitment to their downsizing in the implementation of the delegation but without saying whether this downsizing must be one percent 2 10 or 50 Of course our amendment proposing to indicate this reduction at least to the extent of 50 was also rejected But does it seem normal to you ladies and gentlemen that all the leadership of the Ministry of Justice should be held by judges who are out of office with one exception which in fact confirms the rule You did not even want to remedy the scandalous privilege of the double salary that the off duty magistrates receive which continue to perceive the substantial emolument as a magistrate adding it to the allowance for the function they perform out of role as if it were an annuity On this too all the amendments which aimed to put an end to it were rejected In this law less than any other privilege is addressed than to define feudal in nature is the minimum I refer to the privilege of substantial immunity which in violation of Article 28 of the Constitution the law on the responsibility of the magistrates guarantees the magistrates that by their wrong and negligent acts and decisions with guilt and malice they cause damage to the citizens It is a substantial immunity a feudal privilege I repeat because in democracy everyone should respond to the consequences of their mistakes it is a fundamental principle of our legal system as well as a constitutional principle Dear Minister when there is someone more equal than others as George Orwell taught us in the book The Farm of Animals then there is no more democracy Re-read Article 28 of the Constitution it applies to all civil servants it does not apply to magistrates But does it seem normal to you that a magistrate who causes even a billion damages with his decision the most wrong and negligent in the world responds differently from all other citizens within six months of his salary Can a magistrate fail a company that is worth billions and responds within six gross monthly amounts of his salary Madam Minister And no one is scandalized by this But is it not written in the law that all respond to their obligations with their present and future assets It should be added to Article 2740 of the Civil Code except for the magistrates who still have a feudal privilege Too weak is also the solution adopted for the separation of functions between pm and judges Keeping a single passage within nine years what 's the point I ask you Minister what 's the point It is an ideological choice a choice that serves to affirm the full equivalence between the prosecutor and the judge and to deny the evidence namely that the two functions meet requirements mentality mode of action mental dress and form mentis totally opposed to each other Those who judge must be impartial as our Constitution requires Not so of course who must support the accusation for reasons that are so obvious that I do not dwell on it Until the full independence of the two careers is reached it will not be possible to say according to the Brothers of Italy fully realized the principle of the right process which wants to accuse and defend on a level of absolute equality what unfortunately still does not happen today We have tried together with other groups to change the measure at least in some more striking and more obvious points where contradictions were manifest We have tried to amend and improve this legislation somewhat in those parts where it was most harmful An absolute wall impossible to argue Even there was the outrage of the PD secretary Enrico Letta who allowed himself to mark as obstruction the presentation of a few dozen amendments calling even for confidence in yesterday 's day because some groups with a few dozen amendments among other things discussed in this House in two or three hours have tried to improve this measure This is the concept of democracy of the Democratic Party which with this exit of its secretary openly manifests all its authoritarian vocation And the Democratic Party certainly has the straw tail because when we speak euphemistically of the polluted relationship between politics and the judiciary we should be a little clearer because Palamara 's interceptions speak clearly because the two books of Palamara speak clearly The theme is not the relationship between politics and the judiciary dear Minister the theme is the relationship between a particular political party which is the majority shareholder of its Government and which is called the Democratic Party and certain judiciary enslaved to that party This is the reason why today we adopt a law that is useless if not harmful and this is the reason why Brothers of Italy strongly expresses their vote against it,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#BalboniAlberto,Balboni FdI Mr President we in the Fratelli d'Italia Group believe that when a recomposition is possible politics must also take a step back I think that what my colleague said just now corresponds to a real situation which is not a way of taking time which is why I believe that this House should unanimously allow some time because we know that in the courtrooms we sometimes end up deepening the gap rather than reaching a composition which is always desirable in these cases There is of course the issue of inconvenience but it is not a monopoly of anyone to give a judgment on this issue when we enter into the matter we will give a judgment regardless of the same positions of the Group belonging to the colleague who today should be judged on the issue of inconveniability I believe that common sense must always and in any case lead to a friendly and compositional solution and not to deepen the differences That is why we shall be voting in favour of the request for a short postponement,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,7.38905,-8.137121,15,balboni fdi mr president fratelli d'italia group believe recomposition possible politics must also take step back think colleague said corresponds real situation way taking time believe house unanimously allow time know courtrooms sometimes end deepening gap rather reaching composition always desirable cases course issue inconvenience monopoly anyone give judgment issue enter matter give judgment regardless positions group belonging colleague today judged issue inconveniability believe common sense must always case lead friendly compositional solution deepen differences shall voting favour request short postponement
#BalboniAlberto,Balboni FdI Mr President for Brothers of Italy the Constitution is sacred We are a patriotic party and you cannot love the Homeland if you do not love the fundamental law that the Italian people have given to regulate their social political economic relations and on which the high and noble civil coexistence of the Italian people is based And the Constitution respects it as a whole including Article 68 Today this House is called upon to judge whether the Florence prosecutors have respected Rule 68 or not We share the rapporteur 's conclusions and consider it out of the question that the Florence Public Prosecutor has blatantly violated Article 68 of the Italian Constitution The rule is very clear both Rule 68 and the implementing law the correspondence of a Member of Parliament cannot be seized without the permission of the House to which he belongs This is an irrefutable fact And by correspondence of course it is not just a paper letter but we must also consider all other forms of written communication that technology has made available to us whether it is messages WhatsApp whether it is e-mail letters or even the statement that the bank sends to its customer These are forms of correspondence which could not be acquired even with third parties not just with a Member of Parliament as the Florence Public Prosecutor did However if there was a need for further feedback just go and look at what the Milan Public Prosecutor did then another prosecutor of the Italian Republic towards a senator also belonging to this Assembly when the Milan Public Prosecutor in the case of Siri was confronted with correspondence between a third party and the Senator he immediately suspended his operations and asked the Senate for permission to proceed thus respecting the law and the Constitution So he did not do the Florence prosecutor who even in the face of the invitations of Senator Renzi 's lawyers also demanded to go ahead even though he was aware that he was violating the Constitution There is no doubt then that politics Parliament for the dignity of the Senate institutions and democracy because this House represents the Italian people has not only the right but as Senator Renzi rightly pointed out the duty to intervene That is why we shall vote in favour of the proposal by the rapporteur Mrs Modena and we hope that the whole House will have the courage to say that the rules must be respected especially by the judiciary also and above all by the Florence Public Prosecutor as by any other magistrate who by exercising justice in the name of the Italian people must therefore before and more than anyone else respect the fundamental law that the Italian people have given himself It is obvious as Mr Renzi has said that the matter does not concern his personal affair it does not concern the trial to which he is subject and the request for referral to trial of his person even if five judgments of the Court of Cassation on the illegality of the work of the Florence Public Prosecutor some doubt must make us come and some questions colleagues must make us ask it For example we should all question ourselves if it still makes sense to maintain a feudal privilege such as the non-responsibility of the magistrates today Of course the Constitutional Court has not admitted the referendum but this should be an incentive for Parliament to intervene on the responsibility of the judges for their actions It is not possible to maintain this privilege of feudal order I repeat so that we all respond to the damage we cause by our actions but the magistrates are not are immune are above and outside the law This is a vulnus to the democratic principle which as an Italian Parliament we should finally have the courage to put our hands on Another issue on which the story questions us and I also agree with Senator Renzi is the relationship between politics and information between democracy and information because information must always be limited to what is of public interest Looking from the hole in the lock to read what father and son write is not information and it is not even populism it is shameful demagogy towards which there is no right and there is no left but there is only those who defend freedom dignity and the right of confidentiality because even the politician outside the public sphere has the right to his confidentiality with his personal and his family just like anyone else The shame of those who look from the lock hole to sell some extra copies or to make an extra scoop is another topic on which we have to question Senator Renzi we must not only do so when they shamefully publish private letters concerning her but also when for example a journalist allows himself to ask a mother if she has or has not vaccinated her child The scandal is Madam President that no one is indignant about that question that deeply wounds the dignity of that mother or father Here we should be indignant about that question and not about the answer that that mother gave forced raped by that impertinent and inappropriate question The private sphere is private sphere and personal choices are personal choices and should not be used politically either by information or by a political opponent Do you see how many issues we should and could address today if we had the dignity and I hope this House proves to have it to say that the law is really the same for everyone starting with our Constitutional Charter,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#IannoneAntonio,"IANNONE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government we sincerely are not surprised that the Government and the majority are on Mars to which we are now accustomed but that they do not hear the cries coming from the Earth We are dealing with a very complex and important measure which has been reduced to a stew with articles which have practically not been dealt with by this branch of Parliament and with articles modified with downward agreements One thing has been done a politically criminal choice has been made for Brothers of Italy to decree the death of 30,000 Italian companies Our beaches have written a page in the history of our nation and are an excellence of the Italian productive world which has resisted over the years has resisted the pandemic and has resisted the incomprehensible measures that have been enacted by the government even during the period of the pandemic We do n't have to prove which side we 're on We say this with an absolute conviction because it shows what we have done over the years in terms of battles for our beaches I go backwards in 2019 we said that a definitive and clear solution had to be found that would give certainty to these people because going forward with extensions they would be exposed to a serious risk We were unheard and the facts then showed up in all their crudeness So dear gentlemen how can one think of acting in this way in the most absolute contempt for the lives and work of these people However they have been subjected to a press campaign which I do not hesitate to call shameful because they have been painted as scroungers of the State They are people who have worked with honor for many generations who give employment to many people and who offer a service that is considered an Italian excellence to see them painted in this way really offends and mortifies Unfortunately we are well aware of the root of this because we have also listened to unworthy words in this House If the extensions have been made it is certainly not the fault of the beaches but of governments that have not decided of governments supported by some political forces that lose the elections punctually for ten years but are always in the government If these companies paid insufficient fees however they did not determine them themselves the fees were paid on the basis of what they were asked for I would add that this argument is really ridiculous because if we have headaches the solution is not to cut off our heads but to take aspirin So it is not possible to accept that these people are also offended and vile We have always brought the proposals our amendments are always there On this day which is very sad for the Italian beaches there are some things that have definitely ripped a laugh To feel that the blame for this situation lies with the opposition leader Giorgia Meloni is really ridiculous It is also ridiculous to hear this in the light of the fact that Commissioner Bolkestein the father of the directive said in Parliament that the Bolkestein directive does not apply to State concessions So what has been said in this House by the Movimento 5 Stars is a real stupidity but we know it well and even the beaches know it well For them there is always a solution close and there will be citizenship income for you Let 's say that the work must be mortified and penalized because there is this instrument that destroyed the Italian productive fabric Take a tour of the businesses let yourself be told how difficult it is especially in the south to find people who go to work because you have given them state methadone Then before you speak of others shut up listen do not be intolerant of the only force in opposition You have a majority which is before your eyes there are those who think they are Robin Hood and those who think they are the Sheriff of Nottingham Have you listened to the statements of the majority forces There are those who are convinced that they are doing a great thing for the state treasury and those who say we are voting in favour but then we are going to change it It 's embarrassing Then you want to talk about the opposition and allow yourself to name Giorgia Meloni the only coherent tale of Italian politics There is no decency in this House in the absolute way I have heard words that I share for example the criticism of the decision of the Council of State but here we have to be consistent with the vote ladies and gentlemen That sentence is an offense to the whole Parliament not only because it is written with the devil 's hand but because it has allowed itself to go as far as occupying the perimeter of the legislative power which until proven otherwise belongs to this House which belongs to the people In the days of last week in those convulsive hours you were called as schoolchildren by the President in Office of the Council who told you in eight minutes either you do so without even trust otherwise we loose the lines and all at home This is probably because in the next few days it must bring to the European Union as a guarantee of the PNRR the head of the Italian seaside resorts That is the truth and it is a shameful truth because we must stand by what is written there is no such conditionality for the PNRR We are the State we represent the State and the laws we make are only written Whoever makes the laws without writing them and wants them to be respected surreptitiously bears all other names but it is not called State Then I am very sorry that I have also heard from the leader of the League a specious controversy about the amendment but you know well what you have done in the Commission instead of tabling an amendment signed by the rapporteur and the government you have tabled rewordings of your sub-amendments which have precluded our own Do you want to continue voting against Italian bathing PRESIDENT The debate is closed Conclude Senator Iannone IANNONE FdI You could do that because there

#IannoneAntonio,IANNONE FdI Mr President we are witnessing yet another vote of confidence and Brothers of Italy for the umpteenth time will say no to this Government which seems more and more like a mad mayonnaise I say this because together with my colleagues Senator Malan and Senator Barbaro as well as my colleagues from the 5th Commission Senators Calandrini and De Carlo we have from the beginning placed ourselves against this measure with an attitude of extreme seriousness and responsibility in the awareness of what it could and should represent for our nation We are talking about urgent measures for the implementation of the PNRR Well if good morning is seen from the morning first there has been this troubled experience that we have experienced in the Commissions I repeat a kidnapping for whole days During the day there were continuous delays and at night we tried to recover the lost time for a clear lack of homogeneous vision within the majority and lack of relationship with the government I turn to President Nencini whom I will never lack respect and human esteem who knows how to be sincere in thanking him together with the rapporteur Mr Cangini and the Undersecretary Bini for the human availability which has never failed in the confrontation I would add however that frankly we feel that we are listening to Swedish tourists who are visiting Parliament who disassociate themselves from their choices since in the near future we will see a vote of confidence where all those critics will vote in favour of trust I would remind you that we have listened to virtually all the parties from the general debate to the explanations of vote so far to complain and criticize rightly the way in which the work has been done and also the merit of the measure as it has been dealt with and for what comes out of it I would like to express solidarity with my colleagues in the majority for the obvious short circuit that there has been with the Government but even more so with the Italian citizens who have to attend this authentic theater in which we recognize all the limit of the work done and then the conclusion remains the exact reverse I believe that this is mortifying for political stories that deserve much more dignity but unfortunately our leader Giorgia Meloni was right in saying that this Government and this majority are not together so there can be no other result except what every day becomes more evident We have tried in every way to help achieve the ultimate result and for intellectual honesty I must also respond to certain amendments which have been adopted in a dry way to others which have been absorbed by other amendments or in any case of content which have been transposed The rapporteurs and Presidents of the Commission are well aware that those amendments did not represent the priorities that Brothers of Italy had indicated In any case we believe that we have been more useful to the majority than the majority have been useful to us but this is the attitude that Brothers of Italy has taken from the first moment because we are consistent with the opposition of the Government but we will never play the worst so much better towards our homeland We have proposed amendments to help municipalities and provinces Those who have been local administrator know well that some municipalities have difficulty finding even the secretaries general and some Provinces after the Delrio reform which many have voted that many criticize and that many want to dismantle without succeed are ghost entities They are like Totò 's fog in Milan they are there but they are not visible After emptying them of their human capital do we think that these entities that want to accept the challenge of the PNRR can conclude something positive We have tried to support the proposals that came to us from the Italian National Association of Municipalities ANCI and the Union of Provinces of Italy UPI from those administrators who are of all political parties and who share a condition of extreme difficulty in which every day they are forced to say with facts and words I wish but I cannot One chapter of the measure is dedicated to the school and was the final rock In my opinion the mistake was in the beginning We also talked about this with the Minister and with President Nencini to whom I wish to bear witness to institutional culture because about a month ago they had the kindness to intervene in the initiative that we had promoted of the general states of the school and we had received an openness that we wanted to believe because it seemed important to us I must say that what emerges is very disappointing because the priority that we identify that is the stabilisation of our precarious staff of the school once again does not find its fulfillment This government is concerned not to incur a European infringement procedure in relation to our beaches condemning them to death when instead we are already in infringement procedure for our teachers who are not stabilized It is then clear that we see the reality we want and above all it is not a discovery today that politics has abdicated the role of choosing deciding and taking responsibility for the technostructures that have been raging for too long Maybe you 're waking up too late compared to this reality If we do not give respect for our role first who should give it to us What is the use of elections when it is allowed since we have been waiting for years to return to the polls and see the succession of governments that are built in vitro if then the story is made by the General Accounting of the State This is what citizens do not understand in terms of the role of politics Mr President I am beginning to conclude without lingering in so many other matters Too many times we read in the press x-rays to the ruling class of Brothers of Italy more or less ready to the challenge of government I believe that if these reporters had listened carefully to the work as they have been doing these days they would have had to review their judgment a great deal We humbly and with the knowledge that we will also have to

#IannoneAntonio,"IANNONE FdI Mr President Brothers of Italy can only confirm his vote against the measure under consideration which was characterized by an institutional stew troubled articles approved in the Senate others approved in the Chamber excerpts and a concept of competition in reality much closer to that of sale a sale to the detriment of Italian work of those people who every day do their duty to bring the bread home and who work without guarantees only by the force of their professionalism and who obviously the Government and the majority have not been able to safeguard in the measure under discussion For this reason we have voted against it in a convincing way here in the Senate then in the Chamber and we will do it again today as we have already done on all the articles because for Brothers of Italy the defence of Italian work is a priority and a possibility that does not allow compromises The bill contains general claims that even support competition for professionals Does it mean that you want to abolish professional orders that you want to decimate our professionals that you want to continue in that evil project of the so called Bersani sheets to proletarianize the liberal professions with a serious damage in terms of guarantee for customers There are also the shameful auctions both as regards hydropower and for our beaches We have made a commitment we have consistently fought alongside them but we want to project this commitment in the next parliamentary term because we are convinced that this bill contains a very serious injustice If we have heard from the father of the Bolkestein directive that it does not apply to state property concessions because it concerns services we do not understand why the government has gone on to the end towards these people and these 30,000 Italian companies that give jobs to so many people and that represent a story of excellence of our nation To see them treated in this way truly indignant We have hoped until the end for a rethink we have always been present with our amendments even at the time of the European delegation law because we believe that these people should have a different perspective as we say since the adoption of the budget law in 2019 People who have made investments cannot be seen expropriated in this way of the work they have done with dignity and honor for so many years We have also witnessed a press campaign against them in which they have been painted as scroungers of the state because according to some they pay poor canons To these people I would like to remind you that the Italian beaches did not determine their fees themselves but they paid exactly what the State asked them to do This story this rhetoric is not acceptable in order to arouse indignation and social envy It is true that unfortunately in recent years we have witnessed an action of some political forces that have founded their claim of consent only on this generating envy and division towards the Italian social body In these last days of Pompeii I believe that many have the conviction that we have reached the end of the line In the new legislature we will have to remedy the many distortions that have taken place in the various measures but in particular those which have taken place in this measure No to Bolkestein no to the expropriation of Italian work no to auctions this represents for us a moloch a very precise commitment which after the judgment of September 25 will continue to represent one of the highest priorities of Brothers of Italy in the reaffirmation of the value for which in a meritorious society we all start from the same point but those who are better at sacrificing themselves must go further and reap the fruit of their work The solution is not cannot and must not be the income of citizenship Those who expropriate will be expropriated and on September 26 we will have the basis for a new government led by our leader Giorgia Meloni that puts hand to the real reforms of the country and not to those demanded under the dictation of the interests of the multinationals and of all those powers that want to make the people weak and humiliate those who instead did and want to continue to do their work For this reason I announce the vote against the Brothers of Italy Group",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#IannoneAntonio,"Mr President this law of European delegation gives us the opportunity to return to an issue that is dear to us and which represents an injustice to the Italians that we cannot accept If everyone has now thrown the sponge on the issue of Italian bathing Brothers of Italy has no intention of doing so As we have committed ourselves to the competition measure we will table our amendments on every measure that will give us the opportunity on the ground to do so because for us the expropriation of Italian work represents an intolerable activity by the Government and the majority For this reason we have also tabled an amendment to this measure at the first signature of Senator Fazzolari which will speak in an explanation of vote but signed by all the Senators members of the Group of Brothers of Italy to ask the Government to have a rethink on this matter and to make a serious effort to ensure that Italy is not committed a self proclaimed wrong because if the father of the directive Commissioner Bolkestein said that it does not apply to State concessions we do not understand why the Government and those who claim it want to be more realistic than the king It could be assumed that we are faced with an activity deliberately aimed at penalising the work of these people who for years have written a valuable history of Italian production that envys us the whole world and that has remained after the competition decree truly unarmed in not being represented after being illusory by so many political forces We will consistently continue to interpret the line we have married from the first moment saying no to the Bolkestein directive no to the expropriation of Italian work and ensuring that you have to pronounce every time there is the possibility until the end of this legislature Last time in fact we also witnessed a quirky controversy according to which we did not retable in this House the amendment that had been rejected in the Commission Well we have also tabled Amendment 20.0.4 to this law you have already rejected it in the Commission we will see in a few hours how you are going to decide again on this matter It makes you smile to hear that a result has been achieved and then in the new legislature we will see Those who think of it as the Italian beaches have the duty to decide today on this matter because these people their families their employees their customers cannot be treated in this way to be literally vile as happened even with a shameful press campaign evidently financed by those economic powers that want to benefit from this expropriation We 've heard that these people were scroungers on the back of the state who paid poor canons But who set the fees for them but the state There are political forces that claim that these people pay just 100 million euros of concessions for a turnover of about 14 billion forgetting to say that on those 14 million they pay taxes VAT so it is not only the fees but also all that is paid to the State in terms of taxes And anyway if the fees are low the solution is not to take the beaches off our beaches to give them to the multinationals It is not acceptable what happened in terms of political decision in the absence of a serious mapping of our property It is not possible to think that history ends here in this way without caring for the fate of 30,000 enterprises and of everything they have represented they represent and can represent for our nation Brothers of Italy as our leader Giorgia Meloni teaches us every day is the party of the homeland Everywhere there is an Italian who suffers an injustice and here is more than one we feel the duty to fight this battle to the end We also hope that the reason as well as the sentiment of those in this House who are to represent the people will arise Some of my previous colleagues have said that Community law cannot strangle our national sovereignty It seems to me that in the case of our beaches it was we who took the noose and stuck it around our necks otherwise we do not explain the completely different attitude that is reserved for other European realities such as Spain and Portugal for which there is no problem with the Bolkestein directive which at all costs is intended to apply to our beaches first but we fear that the turn of other categories will also come Brothers

#RomeoMassimiliano,ROMEO L SP PSd Az Mr President I would simply like to say that the Lega Group takes up the appeal made by the Brothers of Italy Group not so much for a second thought but because as I shall now explain the Lega has always consistently maintained in all fora that bathing concessions should be excluded from the Bolkestein Directive To do this we obviously need a European standard that goes in this direction and this is the right and appropriate delegation law to stimulate the European Union in this respect Another issue is the draft competition law which we voted for for a very simple reason we were faced with a decision of the Council of State that disenforced Law No 145 of 2018 which many of those who applauded before voted with us when they were at the government with us to say how much consistency is important and necessary and in the face of that decision of the Council of State with the risk of condemning our companies to an abusive occupation with all that it could achieve we had to intervene at the regulatory level to protect them also providing for the criteria of reward to prevent that from January 2023 the races could be highlighted even with the risk that foreign investors could come to appropriate our beaches We have therefore acted for protection and defence by voting in favour of the draft competition law with all the rewards and issues that I myself highlighted in this House in that speech On the other hand in view of the real and concrete possibility for Europe to re-examine this issue with regard to our ideas we will vote in favour of it and of course we support your amendment as a group bearing in mind another aspect that strengthens our vote in favour namely that there is a judgment since we had to act because of a decision of the Council of State of the TAR of Lecce which refers to the European Court of Justice the assessments on the applicability of the Bolkestein Directive to bathing concessions All the more reason for this vote to be in favour and indeed we are calling on Parliament to do justice in this area once and for all,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,15.3816805,-9.715111,15,romeo l sp psd az mr president would simply like say lega group takes appeal made brothers italy group much second thought shall explain lega always consistently maintained fora bathing concessions excluded bolkestein directive obviously need european standard goes direction right appropriate delegation law stimulate european union respect another issue draft competition law voted simple reason faced decision council state disenforced law 145 2018 many applauded voted us government us say much consistency important necessary face decision council state risk condemning companies abusive occupation could achieve intervene regulatory level protect also providing criteria reward prevent january 2023 races could highlighted even risk foreign investors could come appropriate beaches therefore acted protection defence voting favour draft competition law rewards issues highlighted house speech hand view real concrete possibility europe re-examine issue regard ideas vote favour course support amendment group bearing mind another aspect strengthens vote favour namely judgment since act decision council state tar lecce refers european court justice assessments applicability bolkestein directive bathing concessions reason vote favour indeed calling parliament justice area

#ZaffiniFrancesco,Mr President I would like to join Mr Cantù in his remarks on the shameful circumstance that we have not been able to recognise the minimum compensation to the families of doctors and medical staff in general who have lost their lives because of the disorganization misinformation and the lack of sufficient mechanisms to protect them in the first and second waves of this epidemic I do so after I have shared the measure in the Commission and on all subsequent occasions when I have tried to convince the Government to do something absolutely normal indispensable dignified I also have to agree with Mr Airola and the others do n't want me In fact listening to the debate the opposition in this Chamber I address the Undersecretary representing the Government really goes far beyond the Brothers of Italy The verbal oral opposition has a remarkable consistency in this House and I could mention the Members who spoke before me the problem is that when you press the button you have to be careful to exchange green with red in short you exchange the vote in favour of the government with the contrary Without uncomfortableing a great Sicilian like Sciascia these people he would have called it quaquaraquà placing them at the top level in the ranking of the men of that great man who was Sciascia I therefore agree with my colleague Mr Airola because in fact Brothers of Italy is the only opposition party that then votes in line with what he says That 's true There are also others who make verbal opposition and then align themselves with what the Government establishes The decree law in conversion bears the norms that have concerned the last Christmas holidays at the end of the year and the epiphany because this Government is attentive to the sanctification of the holidays and has given us a decree law for each holiday the measures today in conversion only those of Christmas and St. Silvestro I do not want the representative of the Government of course there is nothing personal indeed on a personal level I express total solidarity because to those who work at the Ministry of Health with Minister Hope and come here to take all the right considerations heard so far there is only to express human consideration we would miss it Personally I would n't do that However there is a problem of coherence and almost dignity of decency of the institutions of the Senate of the Republic and of Parliament in general Colleagues today we are again dealing with measures that act on the side of the restrictions and we are going to convert them in the presence of a reality of the epidemic that sees us absolutely succumbed It is not a verbal exaggeration to say that you continue to enact and convert mortal measures This is a government that has exercised a deadly action compared to the pandemic and is not an exaggeration because in all the passages of the pandemic from the beginning Italy has recorded and continues to record the record of deaths today This evidence is dramatic because we are not talking about budget liabilities numbers but about hundreds of thousands of deaths and their family members With regard to this the entire Government the Minister of Health the infamous technical and scientific committee CTS the gentlemen who sit in that assembly who still speak still pontificate and are not ashamed to do so We are faced with a dramatically important circumstance we have brought our economy to its knees with dramatic results on our gross domestic product we have prevented the exercise of fundamental freedoms we have also prevented freedom of speech and a calm and normal confrontation on essential issues obtaining as a result the record of the dead still today And even today we go on television and come to Parliament to tell us that we must continue to do the same things we have done to date which have been mortifying And of all this we are not ashamed not even in front of ourselves in front of the mirror in front of our conscience Representative of the Government the things to start doing because others also do obtaining excellent results are to make mechanical ventilation in the classrooms which costs four pounds and must be done immediately to strengthen the transports to avoid the assembly of the boys who do not protect themselves with the masks because they are boys inside the buses of the school transport to develop the home therapies because that is why we have the record of the deaths People who are not treated at home in fact arrive in dramatic conditions in the hospital and die Vaccines must also be updated Mr. Undersecretary why do we continue to vaccinate with the vaccine that protects from the first version of the virus when the virus has completely changed We Mr Undersecretary do not do the tracking and not doing the tracking means completely losing control of the pandemic That is why among others we have the record of deaths We do n't even make sequencing that is we do n't know today if a positive person at Covid because he made a buffer rapid or molecular that is has an Omicron or Delta variant or a new variant because it is possible that there are new variants We do not sequence and be careful that is not what Senator Zaffini says in this Chamber today but he said it six months ago Brusaferro the head of the Higher Health Institute he said that Italy sequenced little We never moved on this pandemic doctors of general medicine who lived the pandemic in absentia Even today the doctors of general medicine are not involved and unfortunately there are many that tell nonsense We do n't do antibody screening which other countries do Before we proceed to other doses and become addicted to the vaccine we have to evaluate the antibodies because if someone had the Covid once or maybe two there are people who had the Covid even three times what is the use of vaccination What good is it when it is written on all sides that the antibodies that derive from the disease are evidently well superior better performing and immunizing vaccine antibodies otherwise old vaccine Why did we buy ten doses of vaccine each in Europe Can the government tell us that Why did we buy ten doses of the old vaccine And why do we continue to administer the old vaccine Is it legitimate to suspect that we simply have to run out of stocks Is it legitimate to suspect that I could talk for another half hour and say the things Italians ask themselves every day Mr President thank you for the time you have given me while the microphone flashes here Colleagues I conclude with a

#ZaffiniFrancesco,Mr President you appreciate the circumstances as Mr Parrini has just said would like to do the same In other words we would like to say basically do as you wish if it were not that we will find ourselves in a few minutes to the fortieth vote of confidence of this truly hypertrophic majority if it were not that the Brothers of Italy is the only party to support the general debate in the Chamber on a measure that becomes important because of the measures it contains and which concern a thousand aspects from health to others which are relevant to important passages in the daily life of our nation if it were not that today we are going directly to discuss with the same style and the same technique that I have seen adopted since I sit on this scranno and that in the inauguration speech of the President of the Republic it has been pointed out as a practice to abandon not to follow and not to repeat We did not vote to elect that President of the Republic but from the next minute we recognized him of course as our President the President of all the President of our Republic You have sanctified him sanctified him beatified him in all your speeches in the Chamber on that occasion as in the other successive ones the last time was just yesterday or the day before yesterday and on that occasion I heard a reference to his high statements I personally share them but in the attitudes you continue to operate in the same way An important measure like the one we are considering today would have deserved in every passage a deepening in the competent Commissions because there would have been time and certainly there would have been also the will on our part as opposition party to do as we never do non-sterile opposition but precise and punctual on the topics and topics Well today instead you increase even the weight of your superficiality of your worrying expedition leaving the entire burden of the general discussion on this provision to the two interventions registered by the party to which I belong Brothers of Italy All this moves me Mr President not to deal with the issues dealt with by the measure because it is an absolutely useless and school based exercise In my speech however I appeal to the institutions which I know are present in so many Members in each of you to ensure that this really does not happen again and that you do not continue to adopt such an attitude in all the measures that you are going to take in this short legislative period which really risks becoming a sort of cross-roads based on this type of attitude Today we are in the presence of numerous emergencies among which paradoxically health care seems to be the least worrying We have a geopolitical emergency that our leaders have dealt with so far We are facing a dramatic economic crisis I believe and hope that Parliament in a whirlwind of dignity my colleague Mr D'Incà will at least be able to regain its rightful role in these circumstances and that the President of the Republic has also recalled in his speech of inauguration,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,7.053584,-5.6625857,15,mr president appreciate circumstances mr parrini said would like words would like say basically wish find minutes fortieth vote confidence truly hypertrophic majority brothers italy party support general debate chamber measure becomes important measures contains concern thousand aspects health others relevant important passages daily life nation today going directly discuss style technique seen adopted since sit scranno inauguration speech president republic pointed practice abandon follow repeat vote elect president republic next minute recognized course president president president republic sanctified sanctified beatified speeches chamber occasion successive ones last time yesterday day yesterday occasion heard reference high statements personally share attitudes continue operate way important measure like one considering today would deserved every passage deepening competent commissions would time certainly would also part opposition party never non-sterile opposition precise punctual topics topics well today instead increase even weight superficiality worrying expedition leaving entire burden general discussion provision two interventions registered party belong brothers italy moves mr president deal issues dealt measure absolutely useless school based exercise speech however appeal institutions know present many members ensure really happen continue adopt attitude measures going take short legislative period really risks becoming sort cross-roads based type attitude today presence numerous emergencies among paradoxically health care seems least worrying geopolitical emergency leaders dealt far facing dramatic economic crisis believe hope parliament whirlwind dignity colleague mr d'incà least able regain rightful role circumstances president republic also recalled speech inauguration

#ZulianiCristiano,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen Senators and Senators in my speech I will quote the words of an Italian entrepreneur Oscar Farinetti who spoke at a convention that took place at national level a few years ago who saw the participation of a great man a great entrepreneur a great person an example of willpower altruism and responsibility I am referring to Ennio Doris and since he has been missing recently I would also say to give him a round of applause In his speech Oscar Farinetti told us about a single peninsula in the narrow world from North to South inside a good sea where the good winds of our seas meet the fresh air of the mountains creating a unique situation in the world From there come some products such as for example the raw ham San Daniele son of the bora and the Dolomites the raw Parma son of the Apuan Alps and the Mediterranean the best pasta in the world that of Gragnano that is created where you meet the fresh air of Castellammare di Stabia with the air of Vesuvio Let us remember that our country our Italy covers the surface of 0.50 percent of that of the world As the President of the Vallardi Agriculture Commission recalled earlier in Italy we have 7,000 edible plant species remembering that Brazil is second with 3,300 plants We have 58,000 animal species 42,000 of land and air 10,500 of salt water and 5,500 of fresh water We are the second largest country in the world for animal species We have 1,200 native vines France which is second has 222 533 olive cultivars Spain second has 70 We have a huge wealth of biodiversity transformed into our agro food heritage Let me give you an example It is misleading that with the nourishing score you refer to 100 grams of product when the diversity of a meal unfolds its benefits thanks to a multitude of nutrients We have a thousand examples at national level if 100 grams of meat are indicated by the nutritious score as a dangerous or carcinogenic substance a variety is associated a multitude of plant products that have very important nutrients benefits that derive from the richness of the dish and not a nutritional richness of 100 grams Our task therefore is to educate a culture of healthy consumption as is our Mediterranean diet which is a UNESCO heritage We have a historical heritage of cultures that have transformed Italian biodiversity into thousands of dishes and courses A father 's job is to teach his son to consume even by tasting a glass of wine and not to let him continue to drink soda drinks or worse energizing preparations that give a tone to an evening of fun It is also up to us politicians to educate and oppose serial planning which is wanted by Brussels I would therefore like to thank President Vallardi and the Commission as a whole who has unitedly signed this motion The union makes force and we have also seen it in the battle that we are carrying out with Prosek in which we are united mainly on issues related to our country In the agri -food sector in defence of Made in Italy we will surely achieve important goals by contrasting the culture of homologation",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#GarneroSantancheDaniela,"Mr President Minister Mr President in Office of the Council ladies and gentlemen many of President Draghi 's passages I must say frankly concern us very much and make us reflect on our near future When you say me the Italians asked perhaps you forget that in democracy the popular will is expressed only by the vote not on the platforms as the triggers used to us and not even by the calls organized by the Democratic Party I must tell you that even those who preceded me like Senator Casini from whom we are certainly divided many positions reminded you of the centrality of Parliament But when Mr President you bring up the two thousand mayors I would like to remind you that they are a little less you forget that in Italy there are eight thousand mayors And what about the other 6,000 mayors who did n't sign the organized appeal For us Mr President in Office the mayors are the representatives of the institutions not the masters of the institutions It 's a fundamental difference I must also say that I have thought about your story Mr President in Office of the Council a story of great commitment and certainty the story of a man with a straight back who has always tried to do the interests of Italians I therefore ask you if you can explain to me in your reply what has changed in these six days since you said a week ago that you were leaving because there were no longer any conditions for this Government to work What has changed these six days We have not seen any change Since you are a man who does things if you think you can do it because I do not think you need that chair to occupy your time I have the doubt that perhaps you too Mr President in Office of the Council are not free to choose what you must and want to do If you answer in your reply I 'll thank you In one passage you said that there were unauthorized protests and I believe that you were referring to those for the Bolkestein directive and I add the protests of taxi drivers and beachmen I therefore ask you to explain to me whether the landings are authorized and if so who authorizes them in our country How come Mr President in Office of the Council today you did not say a word about the easy citizenship that the Democratic Party wants on free drugs that has been talked about so much these days Perhaps you are afraid of not liking the Democratic Party your true supporter In my opinion three clues make a test and today you gave us all three of these clues the first when yesterday morning you first met the secretary of the Democratic Party Letta the second as I told you just now when no flag of the PD was brought up to not hit him the third clue is his speech that was so wide in the program perhaps I misunderstand that I think I am the program for the next legislature Perhaps Mr President in Office of the Council you imagine training such as the so called Ursula coalition in order to remain President of the Council but I would also ask you to be clear on this in your reply because six months seem to me to be a few months in order to achieve such a detailed programme There is also a very clear point to which no one can unequivocally have understood something different Today in your speech you said these are my conditions take or leave If you want me to be the President of the Council you parties do n't count anything I do what I want and move on These are the conditions These are full powers those full powers on which the Left has had an infinite debate while today we find ourselves with a President in Office of the Council who in fact calls for full powers Starting at the conclusion we of Brothers of Italy as everyone knows ask for the vote and we do not ask for it today but we did it even when we were at 4 We do not just ask today how someone wants to make people believe because polls are for the benefit of our political movement we have always asked for this because we do not like the chaos nor the alchemies of the palace we do not like it when the choice is taken away from the Italians We want to vote immediately because perhaps unlike you we have a certainty a vision a program We believe that today we would need a strong government with a cohesive majority with a program made together because we must face the near future without shocks because we know the dramatic issues and the serious problems that afflict the Italians I 'll give you some unsolicited advice Mr. President We expect it would be good and fair that should you wish to continue this new political life it is you Mr President who are now asking for the vote Democracy this is clear to all can only be legitimized by the vote of the Italians there is no other method in democracies",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#CampariMaurizio,Mr President ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to thank the Vice Minister the two rapporteurs and the whole Commission including the minority for the work that has been carried out which has actually been very fruitful and which has been as smooth as it should be for a job of this magnitude because this measure stems from a really fundamental and important necessity because by now European norms did not allow us to go further with the old code we were in some cases in breach and therefore we had to go to remedy by defining a new code for which this delegation is given to the Government in order to compensate and repair the distortions that had now occurred In addition to this the PNRR provided for the definition of a new code because as it was written black on white this code caused several implementation difficulties it was seen that it was a code that did not work There is a need for rationalization reordering and simplification of the rules How many times in recent times have we said that things have worked out well After the tragedy of the bridge in Genoa there was almost a miracle from the point of view of businesses and works and it was a success of Italy because the bureaucracy for once had left room for common sense At this point however we cannot allow this experience this success simply to remain a parenthesis we must take an example from what has been done good and carry it forward In the contents it was therefore necessary to give a delegation to the Government to define a code more adherent to the European norms that did not provide for the strict norms quite absurd abstruse purely Italian in order to allow a recovery of competitiveness also of our companies at European level without having to serve a birth penalty We need a reduction in time a certainty of time to do this work We need to streamline procedures speed up responses to the world of work focus and focus our energies in order to actually succeed in the contract rather than waste time preparing for the contract It was necessary to introduce innovations that were intelligent and actually aimed at improving the situation in the world of work We needed for example to provide penalties and premiums penalties to stimulate better and rewards that could actually encourage those who work well It was necessary to introduce rules that would favour investments and green technologies or digital innovation sustainable development all measures included in this standard that works properly 15.32 Follows CAMPARI In the Commission work has been done in this direction which has also improved the text for example secondary discipline has been redesigned because not all contracts and works are equal so depending on the types of contract the rules have been made even more slender fit and simple A facility has been provided for example for access to work by micro-enterprises this is going to solve a problem that has been pointed out several times with the aim of rewarding the virtuous enterprises of the territory those small businesses that we know that work those at zero kilometer This through the impedance of subdivision into fictitious lots or the amalgamation of fictitious lots Therefore it has been given value to neighbouring enterprises Work has been done on limiting the draw also in this case aimed at enhancing quality because here too we have to go on what we know and that works Minimum environmental criteria have been defined this is right we are at a time when we have a new awareness of how important it really is to respect the environment but this must be done gradually and with adequate time to enable companies to align themselves with these needs Made in Italy has been defended through the inclusion of a premium for those who use mostly Italian products absolute guarantee of quality Very important clauses have been included also in this case particularly relevant to small businesses I am referring to the price review therefore the possibility of adjusting the price paid to companies in the event of exceptional and unforeseeable events A comprehensive work has been done to make procurement actually more manageable and objectively operational and functional so that a work is carried out in an appropriate just and correct manner I think that good work has been done and that the Government now has the opportunity to translate the Commission 's indication into an effective act However we are available for any need I believe that professionalism within the Commission is a resource to be used and I therefore only have to wish for a good job so that the Government can organize the implementing decrees at its best and expeditiously I recommend that all too often the work is stranded in hidden meanders of the Ministry and a truly effective new measure can soon be launched,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,12.652919,-10.459946,15,mr president ladies

#RuspandiniMassimo,"Ruspandini FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen what we are about to vote on is a reform that Brothers of Italy has had in its hands for a long time The need to revise the procurement rules had become improcrastinable and over the years the stratification of the discipline has generated interpretative chaos as well as being a brake on the infrastructural development and in essence an obstacle to the full realization of competition between small and medium sized enterprises We had therefore welcomed the initiative of this delegation law putting tangible hopes on it a delegation which moreover responds and is part of the logic of simplification as declined in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan It would therefore have been a good opportunity to test our ability to synthesize and to put the needs of all those involved in public procurement into place Brothers of Italy had interpreted it in this spirit in the Commission considering it essential to welcome the suggestions of the public world and I would like to thank for this the local authorities who through professional associations were able to make a great contribution to the hearing At the same time we wanted to give space in our re-elaborations to the equally fundamental experiential background of the private sector the DAC the academic world and the judiciary because the different sensitivities at the various levels of public evidence should have made an essential contribution precisely with a view to simplification Well the work done by the Brothers of Italy in the management of the amending activity to this bill went exactly in this direction we analysed the contributions of all drawing the necessary consequences and formulating the most appropriate reflections However the great expectations we had taken up were disappointed by an attitude of the majority and above all of the Government which basically betrayed the very meaning of the delegation leading to a missed opportunity In fact the first obvious criticality of this delegation which runs the obligation to emphasize is that it leaves very wide space to the activity of the delegated legislator and it is clear that the provision should have been formulated in order to direct more fully the Government that today so enjoys substantially a delegation in white With our amending work we have tried to set limits to the delegated legislative power both with regard to certain principles which for example we have tried to specify and with regard to the modification of certain institutions We have made the most complete identification of the needs for deburocratization already included in the bill trying to introduce benchmarks and for example explicitly inserting the reference to principles inspired by the emerging decrees of 2020 and 2021 which are producing good results in terms of simplification This was followed by the practical declination of the principle with a reference to the desirable involvement of the National Anti-Corruption Authority in the simplification process so that it could become an active part of the public evidence process and that fairness transparency and legality were guaranteed where a simultaneous easing of procedures appears necessary We have tried to put in place provisions that really go in the direction of facilitating and participating in invitations to tender for small and medium sized enterprises For example amendment 1,200 which was then turned into an agenda would have ensured that companies with credit certificates with public administrations could not be excluded in the event of tax irregularities that were not definitively detected These are common sense contributions which go in the direction everyone expected The latter evidence which is a battle of civilization that would prevent the state from acting as a tyrant when demanding credits and being indulgent instead with itself at the time of paying was rejected by this majority in fact It is not a matter of little account nor a technical quibble because when public administrations do not pay at the end the first companies that suffer are those that constitute the nerve of the Italian economy the small and medium sized enterprises that do not have sufficient financial availability and risk to have because of the failures of the contracting stations the tax investigations that then exclude them from the successive races like a furious dog that bites the tail in addition to the damage also the mockery In the field of public procurement where small and medium sized enterprises are affected it is there that not only and not so much the major economic concentrations are rampant but also the great organised crime With this broad delegation gentlemen we do not understand the direction that the Government wants to take for the future to define the rules on procurement which we can only deduce from the nature of the amendments we have tabled and which you have rejected It is not the direction that we like nor the one that serves the Italian enterprise and that the public administrations need in order to be facilitated the job In conclusion Brothers of Italy pressed for the revision of the discipline in an organic way directing the delegated legislator and tightening it to defined principles in order to give oxygen to the enterprises agile instruments to the client and guarantee of transparency and correctness for the realization of constitutional principles of good performance and impartiality of the public administration It does not seem to us ladies and gentlemen that this has happened and although we trust that our intentions can be debated in the House and can find a hotel in the final drafting of the measure today we will reluctantly vote against it I say this because the climate I have breathed and we have lived with our colleagues in the Commission has been truly harmonious and I would like to thank them starting with the rapporteurs We have really worked together and I thank them for the certificates of esteem that we have also received here which are punctually returned However I believe and I say this on

#RuspandiniMassimo,Ruspandini FdI Mr President before speaking in an explanation of vote I am obliged to make a note to Deputy Minister Bellanova always so timely I admired her in the Commission because when she replied to Senator Malan she wanted to confine the matter to a mere administrative act The careful study of Senator Malan goes instead in a completely different direction we would not like to see in ten years some Italian boy point his finger on this dramatic management of the Italian concessions The management of Motorways for Italy cries revenge ma'am We are careful because I think you are taking a responsibility not to intervene putting your head in the sand really dramatic Let 's come to us The amendments approved to the text by the Chamber are those we know we have read them they certainly favour companies they streamline some procedures certainly minimal especially those concerning contracting stations they introduce a series of cases that interest us such as that of the principle of rotation they promote the realization of investments in green and digital technologies certainly yes they go in the direction of innovation and research which also serves us but for us Brothers of Italy are not enough I say this because for years now almost like a broken record we repeat that we want to speed up the procurement procedures we discuss narrate we aspire and we hope a change that goes in the direction of a reform that really the operators of the sector waited for from this measure but all this always seems not to touch the real nodal points of the system Italy that must be reformed deeply Probably however a new government will have to do so a government with a shred of courage Even today we have realised in this House that everything has been cleared in less than half an hour I would like to remind you that the bill should affect thousands of companies thousands of contracting stations Above all it has positive or negative effects which will reverberate on millions of our fellow citizens who are waiting for the conclusion or the start of public works that have always been blocked by the cumbersomeness of a legislation that has always been presented as a resolution of all evils even here I have heard enthusiastic tones which objectively find it difficult to share That is why what we are about to vote on is a reform that the Brothers of Italy Group has been in the lead for a long time at least in its ratio and has an interest in deepening we have done it you have said it and we have repeated it in the Commissions and in the debate in this House We have certainly interpreted this opportunity as an attempt virtuous and important to try to solve the problem and to be a case of resonance of the suggestions of the world of the audience I would like to thank the local authorities for this who have been able to make a great contribution through professional associations at the hearing we have said so and we repeat it At the same time we have tried to interact on another fundamental experiential background in the private sector I am referring to the DAC the academic world and the judiciary All this work also done by the Brothers of Italy Group in the management of the amending activity also in the Chamber of Deputies has once again been lost We cannot forget therefore the work of our colleagues starting with the Senator Ciriani group leader who insisted on facilitating participation in tenders for small and medium sized enterprises I would like to repeat that our amendment would ensure that companies with credit certificates with public administrations could not be excluded in case of tax irregularities that were not definitively established we fought for this and you also promised that the file would be reopened which did not happen This last battle which is of all evidence a battle of civilization that would finally prevent the state from acting as a tyrant in the moment of demanding credits being instead indulgent with itself at the time of paying was rejected by the majority In the field of public procurement we have discussed a great deal in the Commission If I have time I would also like to say a few words about anti-corruption authority because depending on the government this imaginative mechanism which responds to logics that are sometimes quite laughable is interpreted in a different way During the Count 1 Government it had to be slightly modified in the powers and so it was in the Count 2 Government Now there is a delegation in white written in this way in fact it is a delegation in white because in the current situation with the Government Dragons 1 they give themselves superpowers to this imaginative mechanism I do not discuss the authority but the mechanism In conclusion what was pressing for the Brothers of Italy Group was to review the discipline organically directing the delegated legislator drawing on defined principles in order to give oxygen to the companies and agile tools to the client guarantee this yes of transparency and correctness for the realization of the constitutional principles of good performance and impartiality of the public administration It does not seem to us I repeat that all this has happened that is why albeit reluctantly we will still vote no today,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,12.9532995,-9.190034,15,ruspandini

#PellegriniEmanuele,PELLEGRINI Emanuele L SP PSd Az Mr President I believe that the vote in favour of the motions for our examination which concern the Government 's commitment to support and forcefully carry out the Italian headquarters for the Authority against money laundering and the financing of terrorism brings with it an important political fact It certainly gives weight to our country within a European balance that is not always as balanced as it should be As has already been mentioned our country does not have as much importance on the European offices of authority as it should have And we believe that this is an important step in bringing back the weight of our state to the European balance It has been said that one of the elements that supports Italy 's candidacy as the host country is the fact that we have the best legislation I do not know if we have the best legislation but we certainly have a culture that leads us to have a very important sensitivity And this will have to be one of the elements to which the Government will have to resort in structuring all those acts and commitments that at European level will have to lead to a result As has already been said we have already lived in the past when Italy has been sidelined with respect to the political importance it should have had I therefore believe that it will be a time as I say for revenge at European level As we said yesterday particularly during the debate on the bilateral treaty between Italy and France I believe that this will also be an important international moment In our motion at the first signature of Senator Candiani we also included another important element because it is our historical and relevant battle for our country also that of the patent court If it is true that for the Anti-money laundering Authority we have a strict and important legislation it is equally true that we must value the positive data we have within our country such as the fact that in Italy there are a number of patents and trademarks registered and marketed very high that certainly has no equal at European level That is why within our motion we wanted to include another element in order to enhance even more the Italian presence in the European balance However we do not just want to talk about negative things as I said before The anti-money laundering authority because we have the best regulation and we have the mafia phenomenon We also have extremely positive things which are cultural goods In fact always in our motion we asked the Government for a further commitment to bring to Italy the seat of the European Executive Agency for Education and Culture it is another important element We value let 's ask the government everything positive has our country We must stop throwing crosses and curses at each other let 's talk about positive things and think for the best These are important moments The Government the Undersecretary and the Minister will certainly be able to work in this direction and will always have the support of Parliament because we will bring added values this without considering the positive values represented by the induced of course bringing such important authorities on our territory means offering opportunities for work development and creating new and more important professionalism which can then also look to the European and international world We have always said to look outside our borders to learn where we can but let us never forget that in our DNA within our country and our people we have values that we have the right and the duty to spread in the world Let 's not forget that I would like to thank the Government for the commitment that it will certainly want to make and thank Parliament for the support that it will certainly

#NastriGaetano,"Mr President today the Senate Assembly is adopting a measure which precisely for its own part the competition policy should have been of central importance on the other hand we are once again debating a weak but above all questionable measure which is the result of a frayed majority The draft law under consideration should ensure greater competition and open up the sectors of distribution and energy efficiency and local public services to competitiveness precisely through economic actions The passage to the Senate however left only bitter in the mouth for the wasted opportunities also and especially for the discontent that all this has generated Unfortunately the government does wrong things and we no longer have news of the great reforms such as that of the tax indeed precisely on the fiscal delegation we continue to fear the umpteenth death on the Italians through the reform of the land register the usual asset that will be imposed by the Left which unfortunately seems to be the main shareholder of this majority The only thing this Government has managed to achieve is the expropriation of 30,000 Italian companies to give our bathing establishments to foreign multinationals If that 's what our premier Mario Draghi 's great authority was for then we have a big problem A government that calls itself the best and should be such had to allow Italy with the measure under discussion to heal delays in many ways unbreakable and to ensure the renewal of infrastructure transport and water supply These were the urgent things to do Would it not have been an opportunity for example to abolish the income of citizenship now become the panacea of all the evils of South Italy However I would like to return to the subject of bathing concessions which I mentioned earlier What the majority has achieved in this respect is a ridiculous and in some respects also shameful agreement There is still the issue of compensation even at the very risk that this will not be recognised by the European Commission This means leaving the current dealers totally unprotected which will be largely expropriated from their companies in favour of foreign multinationals We want to denounce all this also because the Government has already extensively and clearly demonstrated how you feel about the subject presenting an amendment that transposes the forcing of the Council of State against the legislative power of Parliament even telling the Italians and this is not true that without the auctions on the bathing concessions would have been lacking 19 billion of financing of the PNRR From such a government and from the implementing decrees that it is called to issue we expect nothing more than the definitive bang against tens of thousands of enterprises that represent let us not forget a fundamental piece of our tourism sector At one time the proletarian expropriation was in fashion for the benefit of the State now it is the State that expropriates private individuals for the benefit of other larger private individuals and for some even stronger aspects It 's an absolute shame This government helps those who do not work with the income of citizenship and instead beat those who invest and make pacts with the state It is precisely today 's news that in some areas of our country nine out of ten people have rejected a job offer and prefer to remain unemployed and keep the subsidy Today has been written a not nice page for all those who work Against this disaster Brothers of Italy will continue to fight in every seat We have stressed on several occasions the need to provide for the recognition of the actual commercial value of companies net of the investments made over the years Moreover there is a need to guarantee the right of pre-emption of the current dealers which is fundamental and indispensable to protect 30,000 families who let us not forget have devoted their entire lives to the conduct of these activities for decades A transitional period is also essential for the mapping of beaches The absurd thing is the contradiction inconceivable for Brothers of Italy that arises from the fact that the motorway and hydroelectric concessions and the private public services are not put into competition while at the same time it is urgent for the Government to hit 30,000 small Italian tourist companies in order to favor the foreign multinationals As I said before we need to ban motorway and hydroelectric concessions and not hit 30,000 families that also create a pipeline All this stems from the fact that the majority is split inside and fails to synthesize To conclude it is essential to return to the vote and we will continue to repeat it to the end since it is up to the Italians to decide who to be governed by The sooner that happens the better In the meantime we continue to say no to the sale of our beaches and Brothers of Italy will monitor the decrees of implementation for the good of the citizens Now we can only express our regret especially for the missed opportunity by this Government to exploit the opportunities offered by the measure under consideration Every day

#NastriGaetano,NASTERS FdI Mr President according to UN estimates every year plastic waste at sea is around 8 million tonnes Of course waste is only the tip of the iceberg The sea is literally invaded by plastics which then go to degrade and damage fish fauna The objective of this bill which we have talked a lot about in the Commissions for almost two years now is to contribute to the recovery of the ecosystem and to the promotion of the circular economy and clearly to the recovery of accidentally caught waste as has been said before for the cleaning of the sea Finally one of the important aspects is the awareness raising of the community with the dissemination of behavioural models aimed at preventing the phenomenon of waste abandonment Let us not forget that Italy is two thirds wet from the sea so who better than us should have at heart the emergency of marine waste Brothers of Italy like it very much when the projects are ambitious They fascinate us much less when these projects which in theory could be ambitious do not make the most of their potential This has certainly been a handicap of the bill to our examination so to define it today saves the sea is a discreet exercise of political communication Certainly however it does not represent reality and above all the truth We could call this as I have often said in the Commission a clean sea We precisely because we were aware of the importance of this measure had tabled several amendments To speed up the process some of the amendments had been withdrawn Brothers of Italy had tabled this amendment precisely to improve all the contradictions and there are within the bill By the way I would like to mention one important point given the presence of Mr Undersecretary as well In the budget law the application of plastic tax was postponed to 2023 It should be understood in the meantime what is the government 's orientation plastic yes or plastic no We must not always reason in a punitive logic through taxation because this certainly does not help I would also like to say to my colleagues that the legislation in place creates a great paradox namely that fishermen have to pay for the disposal of waste at sea We on the other hand had prepared an amendment in the Commission together with my colleague Mr Iannone to establish an incentive especially for fish farmers to facilitate the recovery of waste at sea We had proposed the figure of 40 euros for every quintal of waste money recovered but we were not heard This is because when serious solutions are proposed they are clearly rejected Instead of strengthening controls on those who discharge illegally at sea as always put costs on general taxation An alternative system had to be found to cover the costs of managing waste recovered at sea Why should cleanliness of the sea not fall within the strategic objective of the PNRR In any case it is said that it is necessary to raise awareness and that it is necessary to educate What is said in this bill is that we must inform users and also the population Let 's do it then but seriously If we really want to defend the issue of the environment we must also be a little brave and above all forward looking presidents in legislative measures We hoped that this would be an opportunity to solve the problems of waste for example those abandoned on the beaches or on the coasts which are then sucked into the sea but that was not the case There is systematic talk of finding synergy and also a union with the productive world for the relaunch of environmental issues We were deluded that it was the good time but it did n't For all these reasons our vote will be a vote of abstention because there has been a lack of foresight but above all a strategy to be able to actually help with this

#BossiSimone,"BOSSI Simone L SP PSd Az Mr President we have been following the work of COFE closely both as a party and as a political Commission of the European Union for a long time I therefore think it would be useful to remind this House that this whole series of debates and discussions was initiated at the initiative of the citizens of the Union to enable everyone in Europe to share their ideas and help shape our future through Europe The final result of this great work which involved 52,433 participants on the platform and gave rise to 6,481 online events organized by producing as many as 17,770 proposed ideas collected will be presented next 29 and 30 April precisely in Strasbourg In a few days then we will have a lot of material to discuss discuss and work on for a better future for Europe That is why I naturally ask the House first and then myself whether it would be useful to talk about it today Colleagues I am always very respectful of the work of the Commission and I see in this passage an unnecessary forcing we are bypassing in my opinion somewhat disrespectfully the work that has been started for a long time through a deal assigned to my Commission that of the policies of the European Union bringing to this House today an agenda without taking into account what has been done by our Commission On this desire to put the flag on in the face of all this anxiety of performance I can only make some reflections and I will forgive our figures indicated by the Senate but personally I believe that this strange if not bizarre way of working serves more to some parties of government in order to enhance and give visibility to some senators more than a real necessity in order to face in merit the European future Allow me this to do in the interests of fairness precisely to the Commission and to the work we are doing as the Commission But let us return to the Conference on the future of Europe There has been no lack of criticism on the method rather than on the substance of this amount of work criticism has gone from the way in which European citizens are consulted which on several occasions have complained about the lack of transparency on the promulgation of ideas and the lack of reliability of the effective participation of online events There has indeed been little publicity from the European institutions about the Conference and for this reason in my opinion although the numbers I have read before may seem high there has indeed been little participation a sign of the total sense of remoteness and mistrust on the part of European citizens towards the European institutions themselves It is not just a different Europe that needs different Europeans It could have been an excellent experiment of democracy and transparency in the European Union and a good opportunity but it did not succeed perfectly perhaps also because of the pandemic that has certainly complicated the progress of the work The ideas and contributions collected on the multilingual digital platform covered nine main topics climate change and the environment health stronger economy social justice and employment the European Union in the world values and rights the rule of law and security digital transformation European democracy migration education culture youth and sport Among all these points economic recovery is one of the themes that has recorded the highest participation on the platform given the recent difficulties caused by the pandemic crisis and geopolitical tensions We as League in the various resolutions and motions tabled during this parliamentary term have always stated in writing that it is essential for us to start a debate in order to outline a rethink of the convergence parameters established by the Maastricht Treaty and at the same time to provide for the exclusion of productive investments and those for the security of the territory infrastructure investments and those for the growth of the population concerning the environment from the calculation of the parameters useful to the balance of the budget from the deficit ratio GDP in order to allow also the countries that must pursue the restructuring of the debt to revive the economy by investing in strategic sectors Another topic that we were very fond of was migration many views that emerged in the debate in the Conference call for stronger bilateral partnerships between individual Member States and African countries in order to address migration related issues Concerns have been raised about the risks caused by the extra-European migration flows of European civilisation and political stability Several participants also focused on the use of illegal migration as a weapon I think it is important here to remember the example of Turkey or Belarus It 's important not to forget We as League have repeatedly put down key proposals to rethink the management of immigration in Europe It is essential to combat trafficking in human beings in every possible way It is essential to put at the top of the various migration and security reforms a key principle discouraging departures It is also useful to support the creation in the countries of transit and to belong to special centres where immigrants can be started in order to verify immediately the possible existence of the requirements required to be admitted to the granting of the right of asylum and to commit at European level to the effective compliance with the Return Directive and readmission agreements concluded also at Community level supporting their implementation At the environmental level with the green deal the European Union committed itself to achieving the climate neutrality objective in 2050 and the new European Climate Law which entered into force in July 2021 is precisely the instrument that transforms this political commitment into a binding obligation It is necessary to provide adequate resources to prevent the European plan from turning exclusively into financing to lose the transition in the most polluting countries and an excessive burden instead for other countries in particular for the industrial sector of Italy In terms of energy nuclear energy has been included by the European Commission in taxonomy recognising it as a sustainable technology for achieving environmental objectives The International Energy Agency not the League has highlighted that in order to achieve the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 it will be necessary to increase the share of nuclear energy at global level In this respect it is useful to open a serious debate as soon as possible and no longer ideological Even if this is not contained in the voting system we can not ignore it 11:40 a.m. followed by Bossi Simone Today more than ever these are issues that lead us to a review of the times of the ecological transition in fact after what is happening we believe that it is more than necessary to address them Italy is one of the most difficult countries for the recent crisis in Ukraine and this has highlighted the need to have a secure stable and independent national energy system also supporting the recovery of the technological gap and advanced know how on nuclear latest generation through collaborations cooperation activities exchanges of scientific personnel international and European projects strengthening the institutions that operate in nuclear safety and radiation protection Finally Madam President we can say that the Conference itself was a very good idea but we probably do not think that the experiment has succeeded very well Predicting bottom up participation involving citizens local communities civil society in the process of rethinking and reforming the Union must be the basis for our approach to the European Union of the future It is important on the one hand to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the European institutions giving greater importance to Parliament the only body elected by direct universal suffrage and at the same time to promote greater transparency of the other bodies from the Commission to the various formations of the Council of the European Union I am thinking in particular of the Economic and Financial Council Ecofin an essential institution that decides political and economic strategies of a Member State This and greater bottom up participation that is not one off are ideas of those who really want to improve the European institution For all these reasons we will vote on the majority agenda which partly goes in this direction aware that there are still many issues to be included and discussed at European level",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,13.953929,-3.0066507,15,"bossi simone l sp psd az mr president

#BossiSimone,Mr President Mr Undersecretary ladies and gentlemen the programme report on Italy 's participation in the European Union for 2022 represents the general vision of the Government on the future prospects of the European Union It indicates the government 's political intentions on the individual European dossiers that are expected to be developed during the year One year the current one unfortunately marked by the human tragedy of the war in Ukraine which is at the same time producing heavy consequences on the economic and social life of our countries already hard tested by the pandemic crisis configuring itself as a heavy setback in the hopes of recovery and development that had emerged following the entry into force of the Next generation EU and the recovery fund In this sense the planning report for 2022 opens with a brief premise of the Undersecretary Amendola who refers to the European Year of Young People 2022 as an inspiration to face with courage and determination the challenges of the present and which must now be renewed in order to face the humanitarian energy and economic challenges posed by the war in Ukraine and to move towards the necessary reforms of the European Union in the direction of pragmatic and ideal federalism starting from the lessons learned during the pandemic and from the proposals formulated in the context of the Conference on the future of the European Union The text of the report submitted to Parliament on 16 May this year presents a comprehensive structure consistent with the forecasts of Article 13 of Law No 234 of 2012 and is divided into four parts each preceded by a brief summary which sets out the positions and actions that the Government intends to take in practice in relation to the individual policies of the European Union The first part entitled Development of the European integration process is devoted to policies and initiatives aimed at strengthening the process of European integration both economically and institutionally The second part entitled Strategic policies develops into five strategic objectives specific to the Commission 's 2022 work programme namely the European green deal a Europe ready for the digital age an economy serving people the promotion of the European lifestyle a new impetus for European democracy Part Three A stronger Europe in the world On the other hand Italy and the EU 's external dimension are concerned with building Europe 's strategic autonomy consistent with Italian interests enabling us to address the economic and social emergency and guarantee the security of our citizens starting from the four priority areas of the European Union 's external dimension common foreign and security policy common security and defence policy trade
