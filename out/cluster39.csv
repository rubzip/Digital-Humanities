#CalandriniNicola,Mr President what is happening in this House today is yet another proof that this Parliament is becoming an appendage of itself We have just heard the rapporteur Mrs Rivolta tell her that there has been no chance of working in the Budget Committee and that we have arrived in this House without having given the rapporteur a mandate This means that we have not been able to do anything in the Commission we have had 48 hours to examine this measure and despite the fact that only 110 amendments were tabled including 30 of this heterogeneous majority we have rejected any proposed amendments and in fact we are discussing a measure in the text approved by the House of Deputies Mr President it would have been nice to have been able to say that this decree law did not need to be amended but the truth is that we are faced with a measure that gives a bland answer to the problems of Italians So let us examine very quickly what the measure under consideration has received with a lofty name a bit like all the other measures that have taken place in the last two years The decree law on aid suggests that it should deal with problems and that it might solve some problems for the Italians Surely we have solved the problem of Minister Franceschini who is always very present in the decree laws that are approved in order to maintain his staff of collaborators to which the contract is extended we have also helped the navigators despite their symbol of the failure of the income of citizenship that they are also seen to extend contract and salary We have nothing against the navigators who are victims of a system that has not worked and which we have obviously always asked to cancel This measure also gives aid and aid to INPS 40 million for purchases of goods and services we even give ourselves the honour of giving Como a million euro for urgent road operations In a decree law that should address the theme of expensive bills expensive materials dear energy we give a million euros in fact to pave a road in the province of Como This and many other electoral tips are contained in the decree law in question and in the others that have succeeded in recent years In short we do n't deny a tip to anyone but someone has to explain to us what the collaborators of Franceschini the navigators the purchase of stationery for the INPS the interventions on roads and environment with everything that instead had to contain the measure in question Imagine if this majority who is thinking only of their own survival is able to really help the Italian people This rather than decreeing aid was to be called a blackmail decree by political forces of a majority that today will lose important pieces Someone 's probably already in the election campaign and we 're happy about that We 're happy about that We too look forward to the vote instead of attending this merciless theater of those who yesterday voted for the House 's trust and today instead will deny it in this Senate Chamber This is not the moment of the scenes and sad performances of sad figures However from this Government and from the coalition that supports it we could not expect anything different a mixture a coacervo of political forces too different from each other to be together was clearly doomed to fail a downward compromise that we have always denounced While outside this Chamber there is a country that is running out of steam a country in difficulty trying to get out of this economic crisis of inflation dear energy dear bill dear fuel this Government and this majority are fighting putting up vetoes discussing the income of citizenship and cannabis forgetting that this country is in canvas and that it is only using its arms to raise itself You have n't been able to agree with each other either You are a Brancaleone army bound only to power and to draw to life You have used the nobility of the emergency and national solidarity to make interests of power yours alone You have left this country to yourself in a guilty and instrumental way You are responsible before the Italians for not being able to be a ruling class at the moment when the country needed authoritative leadership You turned the aid into begging You 've made the Italians of the police That 's what you 'll reckon with the country soon because you 're pulling to live It is however a matter of a few months we have arrived The vote is very close We believe that after today 's vote we can no longer talk about the Dragon Government The holding of this majority is shattered under the Diktats of those who thought only of themselves and to gather some political consensus With this climate of blackmail begas internal quarrels of all against all you are holding the country hostage You could not produce anything good before let alone you can do it today trying to raise some extra vows and thinking that opposing yourself saves your face and saves your dignity We hope to see in a few hours time a leap of pride on the part of this House an awareness of an experience that has come to an end and we say so with all due respect for President Draghi whose authority unfortunately has not been sufficient to appease the appetites of some political forces Today perhaps except for other resounding blows of theater that famous and fateful day has arrived We send home this government and this failed majority enough with the Palace games We trust in the seriousness of Draghi who excluded a Draghi-a and we also trust in the role of the Head of State so that no more rabbits are taken out of the famous cylinder While in fact someone thinks of the reshuffle in order to hold on to the chair we clearly say that it is time to move on and return to the vote Let 's return to the vote and give the Italians the opportunity to choose a Government a strong Government that does the interests of the nation and not the interests of someone in particular Each of us today can vote according to conscience but be assured that from Brothers of Italy there will be no support as we have always done and that we will never be complicit in a coalition as bad as it is disastrous for our

#CalandriniNicola,Mr Calandrini FdI Mr President I would like to join the majority rapporteurs in thanking the Commission for its work which has certainly been carried out in an orderly manner although very compressed in relation to the times for the continuous majority meetings in order to try to find an overall balance in some way with the maxi amendment that is coming to this House today As I said yesterday when I spoke as a minority rapporteur however we denounce and continue to strongly denounce this sort of change of pace that has occurred in this legislature and that has no precedent that is the alternating monocameralism that has actually modified the Constitution so we have moved from a perfect bicameralism to an imperfect bicameralism On this we will not make discounts because it is not possible to continue in this direction with this protagonism of the government that is unprecedented in the country It is indeed a very embarrassing situation for an advanced democracy such as that of our country To come to the subject on the agenda I would also like to say to the rapporteurs that this decree is passed yes but not because of the events linked to the war that is somehow at the door of our Europe because the problem is also a precedent because already on 27 January when it was approved by the Council of Ministers this decree was completely inadequate I spoke about this yesterday by chaosing a series of numbers referring to all the sectors concerned who already at that time had no additional resources to deal with the dramatic situation that they were experiencing because of the pandemic As I said we are in the presence of a decree law that instead of supporting the business world is killing many sectors in particular the building sector inserting yet another anti-fraud correction that penalizes even the honest people who in this last year have operated with honesty regarding this measure I would like to take the example of another simple amendment without any problem of cover which provided for the move of at least three months of the deadline for single family houses from 30 June to 30 September to allow progress to be made Considering the fourteen changes made to this superbonus was the least that could be expected Well even on this amendment there was not the courage on the part of the Government and the majority to give an answer On this we are absolutely not available and are not optimistic about the issues under consideration since on the superbonus we all agree to have to curb the scams but not as we wanted to do with this decree- law because the Revenue Agency also confirmed that the scams for this measure affected only 3 This fierceness which led to about fourteen changes appears completely inadequate and has rather fragile bases So we hope that at least in the final phase of this measure we will allow ourselves to continue in an orderly way so that until December 31 2023 Italian families and companies can be allowed to give answers regarding the economic thrust that this decree can give us for those numbers that I gave yesterday when I explained what construction represents for our country system We are in the presence of a decree law that is largely insufficient The outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine has made it completely useless and overcome by the events that have been there but also by situations prior to the conflict that has been generated For example there is the question of expensive energy which I would like to remind you was already present in the budget law because we have tried to shift sums even some of the sums that were expected to reduce taxes which no one could verify because of those eight billions planned for the Irpef scales nobody noticed Without prejudice to the fact that we are always in favour of reducing taxes we said that multiplier effects had to be created There are 10 billion citizens income I want to remind you because this year the Government of the best has put us even one billion euros more and we have gone from 9 to 10 billion plus the eight billion of the reduction of taxes We said to move them at least in part to create that multiplier effect on national gross domestic product in support of small and medium sized enterprises which represent 80 of Italian companies and are the backbone of the country 's economic system To the dear energy has also been added an unjustified expensive fuels Today we see that in neighbouring countries as my colleague Mr Misiani mentioned like neighbouring Slovenia we have put a roof at the price of fuel one litre of petrol costs EUR 1.50 while we have even reached almost EUR 2.50 and we do not understand why we do not do the same things that our neighbouring countries do So there 's a VAT extraject I want to remind you that we 're cashing in and that extrajective can also be used to do this kind of operation but there 's no time The time has expired dear Undersecretary Sartore I thank you for your helpfulness but you cannot tell us that you have taken notes on certain issues so you have rightly referred to some of the amendments saying that we have adopted legal amendments in this case Even in some cases he referred to authentic interpretations That is true but today we need more today we are at war Today Draghi told us I want to quote what he said that we went from a market economy to a war economy But when you make these statements you also need consequent acts so that you can give answers on these issues So if we do not start with this assumption and start making additional taxes on raw materials or fuels as I said sooner or later we will arrive at the absurdity that petrol in Italy will cost 2.5 euros and in neighbouring Slovenia it will cost 1.5 euros I want to add something very clear This is the time of decisions it is the time of responsibility it is not the time to invent as you have done over the past few weeks the reform of the land register referred to in Article 6 of the law delegates for tax reform which affects how much more valuable there is for the Italians their home As our national leader also said you lie knowing you 're lying In fact the additional tax on the house is there because the rules that accompany Article 6 say it we want to increase the extimes in order to tax and particularly hit the main house in order to compensate for the taxes on labour This is the rule set out in Article 6 Above all you are dusting the ius soli under the lie of the law on citizenship These are the slaps in the face that the Italians do not want to take they suffer At this time immigrants are coming to Europe and Italy and we must be aware that we must welcome these people with open arms who are fleeing from a real war which is what Russia and Ukraine are now investing in We here today must assume our responsibilities but we need Europe 's direct intervention otherwise we can not do it You continue to say that there can be no talk of deviation even that it is dangerous to do so when until six months ago you have committed EUR 200 billion in budgetary deviation committing our children and grandchildren for the next 50 years today we must be careful to talk about deviation However we need Europe 's intervention If you do not want to talk about deviation we are talking about safeguard clauses we must prevent the stability pact from coming into force in Italy because there are no conditions We need a new recovery plan a war recovery plan Targeted measures are needed in respect of raw materials and bills targeted aid is also needed at work to create that multiplier effect that drives the economy to start again Having no more time I am going to conclude Mr President We will be on the side of the Italians and not of the Dragon Government because it disappointed us We will certainly be on the side of the Italian people hoping that President Draghi together with the majority will think of businesses families and farmers Today in fact families are afraid of receiving the electricity bill or going to the gas station to make a full of gasoline that 's exactly what we did n't want that did n't serve this government This on the other hand is what the government is doing So we for this reason and for many other reasons that I do not have time to explain will not vote in favour and will vote against the question of confidence in this measure,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,6.3437405,-18.213518,39,mr calandrini fdi mr president would like join

#PazzagliniGiuliano,Crazy people L SP PSd Az Mr President members of the Government ladies and gentlemen at school I was taught that by changing the order of factors the result does not change Memories of that teaching alas not recent reverse the usual course of the explanation of vote anticipating at the beginning that the vote of the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will be favorable This reversal does not depend on the desire for originality or the desire to distinguish me in some way but rather on the determination to make a contribution to the conversion of the decree law in question The need to convert it by 30 April has given us the time limit so that we have arrived in this House without the rapporteur and without the possibility of improving the text of the measure by tabling amendments and all other acts that usually fall under the prerogatives of a Member of Parliament Let me be clear I 'm not complaining about this In the past I have argued that it is not the Italian Parliament that can determine the development of raw materials at world level nor decide the development of the markets The only part of our control is time but it is crucial because it would allow us to prevent a fair and appropriate measure from not being effective because it is not timely Therefore I welcome the timeliness of the intervention and point out that the contraction of the times is an essential objective element It would be unforgivable if this decree were to lose its effectiveness so I take note of the impossibility of proceeding differently and accept the fact that this Assise will not be able to contribute to the improvement of the provision At the same time however I would like to leave a trace of what we could have done to improve the measure which is unquestionably necessary Some colleagues have censored the government 's alleged abuse of the urgent decree while in this case I believe that no one could discuss the existence of all the requirements of necessity and urgency However I would like to go beyond this reflection and point out that in fact yes all the requirements are met but they should not have been Italy was also the fourth world economy thanks in part or in large part to its manufacturing activity What was the fourth world economy and it is still one of the world 's major economies cannot and must not be found unprepared in the face of an emergency like this It needed programming and avoiding improvisation as unfortunately has been done In fact when you improvise you risk pursuing a dream but you do n't achieve a goal In the past always from this scranno I have highlighted the difference between an objective and a dream the dream is intangible that of going to the moon we can all have it but it is not concrete while the objective is concrete because it is monitorable programmable and staggered in stages that can be progressively implemented and verified in their implementation Some of my colleagues also in this debate have highlighted the need to have only renewable sources That is a beautiful dream which I share but it is indeed such Let 's do a parallel and imagine if the dream of fully electric mobility was implemented immediately What would happen if our entire fleet of passenger cars became electric tomorrow Let 's imagine an exodus of normal August with endless files and civil protection that often has to intervene compared to what would be if all the machines were electric To the normal and usual pathological elements that determine that situation we should in fact add a less autonomy and a greater time of charging of the vehicles which on average exceeds half an hour if it now takes five minutes to make a full of gasoline to recharge whole an electric machine it takes more than half an hour Therefore we must not pursue dreams otherwise we risk renewing that mistake that in the past has caused fundamental choices for our economy and for our country to be put aside Some Members have mentioned nuclear power we might remember many others but this is not the time What I want to highlight is that it is necessary to recover the vision that I do not say generational as it was once for which works were started although knowing that it would not be seen the completion but at least a medium term programming it is indispensable otherwise we will always have to intervene in emergencies and improvise Having said that however I remind myself first of all and my colleagues why this measure is so important and I do so starting not so much from the positive that there is but rather from what is missing to repeat again that the Senate could have made an important contribution to improving this measure It contains a decision which I fully agree with that of the amendment to Article 142 of the Code of Cultural Heritage and the Landscape The League has always asked for simplifications it has done so for the procurement code and for administrative procedures it does so on every subject in this specific case in my opinion the useful and appropriate choice has been to provide precisely a simplification for interventions that could benefit from the superbonus in the cases provided for in Article 142 I now turn to the Government because the lack of time will prevent us from intervening today and in an imminent future but it would not prevent the Government from intervening in a subsequent measure I therefore call on my fellow Members of the Government to pay particular attention to this point because it is a request for action It is useful and appropriate as I said to provide for simplifications and greater possibilities for action in relation to Article 142 In my view it was a wrong choice to exclude Article 136 from these possibilities For colleagues who perhaps want to have a clearer idea of what I am saying Article 142 of the code of cultural goods and landscape refers to areas protected by law now at last it is possible in the intervention also to partially modify the silhouette and volumes of the building because it is absurd that you benefit from a public contribution and you cannot improve the building However this should also be done for the cases referred to in Article 136 which are buildings and areas of considerable public interest I imagine that in the discussion at the Chamber he discussed opposing interests and prevailing requirements and that therefore for some objective motivation perhaps referring to the main Italian cities it was decided to exclude Article 136 from these possibilities I would point out however that the exclusion of Article 136 for the earthquake victims is an important and enormous obstacle to reconstruction Several times I have pointed out that in the attribution of priorities in government action we should have operated as doctors do in a First Aid when they attribute the codes the code red is not given to the healthy patient who has a small cut in an arm it is given to the patient who risks dying or anyway to the serious patient The same thing the Government and Parliament should have done in their action precisely as Executive and Legislative we should have given a red code and priorities to those who risk dying In this case by bringing the parallel to today 's debate we should have given it to the earthquake stricken municipalities which could and should have benefited from the possibilities now available to them under Article 142 extending this intervention to Article 136 Therefore my heartfelt invitation to the Government to provide for it immediately because Parliament could do so in a next measure but we do not know when it will be The government could do that right away I therefore ask you please on behalf of all those people to intervene in a timely manner I see that the time at my disposal is unfortunately almost over I would just like to point out that there are many reasons to vote in favour of this measure not least the 8 billion 6 of which are destined to fight the dear energy an issue which the League has immediately brought to the attention of the parliamentary assemblies but also of the national leadership There is an intervention in this sense and therefore our vote will be strongly favorable because it is a measure albeit not definitive and complete very useful to the

#PepePasquale,Mr President Mr Undersecretary ladies and gentlemen I would like to make a few comments on the debate that has taken place over these hours and days on the reform that we are discussing We have always said as a League that we are in favour of an integral organic and incisive reform of the judicial system and we have always said that following the approval of the House of Deputies we would work in this House to improve the so called Cartabia reform We have always said this because the League has been consistent with itself it has been transparent towards the Italians and it has also been correct towards the allies that at this moment make up the majority that supports the Government Dragons We have always said that the reform as well as leaving the Chamber of Deputies does not give us satisfaction and that we would try as we will to improve it in the Senate For those who are treacherous and I am sorry there is the press review of April 22 in which it is clearly said that the will of the League is to improve the reform of Cartabia in the Senate says the Corriere della Sera says Free says the Republic says The Press and says The Sun 24 Hours Nor is it true as some have suggested this morning that the will to maintain the amendments to the text is a reaction to the referendum We had said this from the beginning because we had a strong and consolidated conviction from the beginning and the only effect that the referendum had was to strengthen it The referendum was in itself a great and extraordinary victory because it was a democratic exercise which we wanted along with many other political actors and Italian civil society others praise it but obviously at the practical moment they fail to give it the right value It was also a great success because the yes prevailed by far over the no and those 10 million Italians who went to the polls deserve respect and consideration At this moment the only way to give respect and consideration is to bring those amendments forward to improve the text that came out of the House I say by the way I allow myself to do so because before me people have said it much more authoritative than me who belong to a world different from mine that is Violante and Spataro that the only real failure in this affair is represented by the incomprehensible strike of the magistrates This was the only real failure which marked a watershed between an old way of understanding the relationship between the judiciary and the country and a new way of understanding that relationship which is evidently tired of old logic and old interpretation So we 're against the Cartabia reform No not at all We are in favour of reform of justice otherwise we would not have promoted the referendum But let us say that the reform must be worthy of this name it must be a more incisive reform a true reform We are not content with the balance that this unnatural majority imposes anyway because we must give account to our country and we must give account to the Italians That of the CSM as my colleague Simone Pillon said before is a sloppy reform which does not actually cancel the currents and does not cancel the power of the currents We are convinced even today that the main way for this to happen is the draw integral and temperate Let 's go on the logic of the draw because it is the only road that allows us to break the link between the currents and the judiciary On the evaluation of judges it is okay that there is an annual and no longer four year dossier but it is also okay that the assessment should be decided not only by the members of the judicial councils but also by the lay members university teachers and lawyers On the separation of functions we would have liked and want more courage and we will do so in this debate today in this House so that we can decide from the beginning of the work and professional journey whether we are on the side of the judiciary or whether we are on the side of the judiciary We also agree on revolving doors because we believe that policymakers should remain outside the judiciary Those who decide to belong to a political party or movement decide in a legitimate way not to be impartial and embrace an ideology a world and certain logics that no longer allow them to be magistrates This which unfortunately the text we are working on does not provide for must apply not only to those who have the honour and the burden of being elected after an election campaign but also to those who simply want to run The moment of discrimination is not the election but the candidacy at that moment the will to belong to one political area is manifested rather than to another We are satisfied with the stop to package appointments and also with the reduction of the number of magistrates who I say with respect are parked at the Ministries However we would have liked more courage incisiveness and organicity Some say let us do this quickly because Europe is asking us to do it and why we have to implement the PNRR It is true and this will must be respected However as President Ostellari said earlier Europe is asking us not only to do things quickly but also to do better and better than what has been done in the past Let 's say more we must reform the justice system because Italy and the Italians have been asking us for decades and not for a few months like Europe so that our

#LaRussaIgnazio,Mr President I did not actually intend to speak in general debate because I thought I could do so in the debate on the vote of confidence that all the newspapers today announce as certain However it is enough to read the agencies or to listen to what is happening outside this Chamber to understand that there is an attempt which we can call desperate to avoid the vote of confidence because the Movimento 5 Stars said that it would not give confidence to the Government of which it is the main representative And then I run to the shelter and I speak now even if only for six minutes I understand very well the correct intransigence now we call it that of President Draghi who said no to Draghi bis putting in ambasce those who would like to pull the rope without breaking it They 'd like to pull the string have some protagonism but go ahead and sit in the chair That 's the figure So what 's the attempt It 's to put the dust under the carpet How do you do that They say not to take a vow of trust Finally after an incredible number of votes of confidence this time that serves to clarify the Government is desperately trying to have the amendments voted to hide under the carpet the dust raised by the Movimento 5 Stars which claims that the Government should fall I could say that we had said that and that from the beginning we had argued that this Government is an iattura for Italy No you do n't I say and I am referring to the friends of the centre right that I have always respected their choice different from ours to be in the government but I am glad that they have now considered the fact that with this Government and under current conditions we can not continue While there are expensive bills war inflation and everything we know Draghi cannot spend his days agreeing not only the center right with the center left but also Letta con Renzi Conte con Di Maio e Conte con stesso Poor Dragons must do that too We therefore feel that we should appeal to the President of the Republic who is among the very few who have not voted for him to whom he knows he joins me with a personal esteem and also with something that is very similar to friendship President Mattarella I know that you even by a political nature are trying to find a way to rectify the situation but please look at what is happening in this House this time and listen to the speeches that are taking place I do not say in the First Republic but in any parliament of the world a government with positions of such profound contrast between the parties that compose it as it is happening here would not stand Mr President of the Republic instead of attempting an impossible patchwork do what the Constitution allows you to do in this situation put your hand on your conscience and give the voice back to the Italians so as to have a compact cohesive government with a serious programme and not the ridiculous opposition that makes us and the Italians ashamed,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,5.6517253,-13.920142,39,mr president actually intend speak general debate thought could debate vote confidence newspapers today announce certain however enough read agencies listen happening outside chamber understand attempt call desperate avoid vote confidence movimento 5 stars said would give confidence government main representative run shelter speak even six minutes understand well correct intransigence call president draghi said draghi bis putting ambasce would like pull rope without breaking 'd like pull string protagonism go ahead sit chair 's figure 's attempt 's put dust carpet say take vow trust finally incredible number votes confidence time serves clarify government desperately trying amendments voted hide carpet dust raised movimento 5 stars claims government fall could say said beginning argued government iattura italy n't say referring friends centre right always respected choice different government glad considered fact government current conditions continue expensive bills war inflation everything know draghi cannot spend days agreeing center right center left also letta con renzi conte con di maio e conte con stesso poor dragons must therefore feel appeal president republic among voted knows joins personal esteem also something similar friendship president mattarella know even political nature trying find way rectify situation please look happening house time listen speeches taking place say first republic parliament world government positions profound contrast parties compose happening would stand mr president republic instead attempting impossible patchwork constitution allows situation put hand conscience give voice back italians compact cohesive government serious programme ridiculous opposition makes us italians ashamed
#LaRussaIgnazio,Mr President first of all I apologize if I asked you to take over from the Presidency I would have continued but I was pleased to speak even if in a Chamber that was not quite full I would like to thank my group 's colleagues who are still present as are other colleagues including Senator Gasparri The reason why I decided to intervene is because I wondered how it is possible that from here to a few minutes the government will have to put its trust in a measure that 95 98 percent of the Senate I do n't know what the exact percentage does not contrast and on which it says favorable Yet the Government on the provision will put trust which is an instrument that serves either when there is obstructionism or more correctly when the Government having within it opinions so divergent that it cannot be brought to unicum decides to say You vote for this measure through trust or resign How is it possible that in the face of the prospect of helping an assaulted country a bombed country a European Christian country which resembles us in ways of life there is today a need for a vote of confidence I do n't know or better I know too much It is also a question of aid which is justified of aid which is necessary and necessary for us too not just for Ukraine In fact there is a before and after Putin 's attack on Ukraine by Russia There was hope or you can say the illusion before the invasion that Europe could be a great economic power without having to have an international policy and a defence policy This illusion has fallen it 's gone We have war not at the borders of Europe but within those who want to be part of it also organically And then maybe it means that there is still someone who thinks it would be more appropriate to put some multicolored flags on the windows maybe make some rounds of peace and not send help or send only some blankets and not military defense aids that hold back a brutal attack and give a precise signal to those today attacking Ukraine and tomorrow could attack not only Georgia or Moldova but also countries that are an integral part of this Europe The other argument is that this debate has been joined not by choice of the Brothers of Italy but by choice of Europe of that Europe so declaimed by choice of our President in Office of the Council of your President in Office of the Council the issue of the amount of funding needed for defence first national and therefore European Those who understand that today European defence can only be the offspring of an adaptation of national defences otherwise they are stammering in terms of political knowledge And then someone wondered how it 's possible to think of increasing defense expenses to 2 while people do n't pay and do n't have the money to pay their bills Do you think we do n't know Look at the requests for measures that come from the right to help families businesses and traders What 's that got to do with anything Why equalize I quote because I am pleased because he is a person who esteems and is intelligent even if he is part of another party of the Democratic Party my colleague Zanda who a couple of hours ago said that Italy repudiates war as a means of resolving international disputes but considers you think he said it a member of the PD and I am proud to read it sacred the duty to defend the Homeland The debate on what should be the priority between spending on the defence of the Homeland and spending on social policies has always existed Governments prior to the present have increased and he says we voted in favour of the defense of our country despite having to face massive percentages of youth unemployment and then there was no war that is now there I would add that we spent a billion and a half a year dutylessly for fifteen years on international missions in distant places because even there we were going to fight terrorism Imagine if the need for a gradual increase in military expenditure to which Italy committed itself in 2004 2006 2014 and yesterday with Draghi and attention not only with Dragons friends of the Movimento 5 Stars with the vote in the Chamber of Movimento 5 Stars With the vote in the House of all parties Then someone said do you want to see that if we change our mind maybe we get back some votes from those we 're losing Then it 's a controversy they wanted to deal with us With us We have done nothing but reiterate what the 5 Stars the PD all the majority parties and of course the center right parties have done to the House what Italy has committed itself to in international fora and which today is compared to the needs of families and businesses Of course but do we not have those famous billions that must come from Europe for families businesses traders workers Have we not perhaps you have not read this proposed a further increase in European funds to advance rising military expenditure Do you know or do n't you know Then decide and if that is why today you force Italy to a figure like that of having to vote with the vote of confidence a measure that should be approved almost unanimously if not unanimously beat your fist and say mea culpa mea culpa mea maxima culpa Shame In conclusion for once we wanted to be able to forget that for us this is a government that if he had gone home earlier would have given the Italians the opportunity to choose one that thought one way or the other but in the same way We had decided to vote in favour of this measure but your begas force us not to do so not because we will vote against the measure but because you have turned it into a different thing into a vote of confidence to a government and the Italians have understood that it cannot be given because it does not deserve it,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#deBertoldiAndrea,Mr President ladies and gentlemen another piece of the PNRR should be in place Another piece that this time had caught me with a little more confidence than the usual government activity When my colleague and leader in the Commission Senator Ruspandini informed me that this time there is no confidence I thought that at last the words of President Mattarella and let us quote with much less importance the repeated demands of the opposition for greater involvement of Parliament had taken effect In this particular case they have had it which we welcome and hope will be a good hope for the continuation of legislative and parliamentary activity Analyzing everything however we are then faced with a delegation law that is really a delegation in white it is yet another delegation in white that Parliament within the framework of the puzzle of the PNRR entrusts to the Government A blank delegation which I would like to call double Parliament gives a blank delegation to the Government and the Government allow me to play a game of words gives a further delegation to the Council of State It is not very simple it has not been so in the past either and I believe that those who at parliamentary level are older than me have rarely seen such a phenomenon they have rarely seen a Parliament delegate the Government and then in turn the Government de facto delegate another body of the State to carry out its functions When we then check in this case with the utmost esteem and respect for the Council of State that this delegation is given to a court who understands some of its procedures administrative acts contracts notices and tenders some problems if it poses it both from a political and democratic point of view because the excess of delegation is never positive and from the point of view of the final result In fact to put in the hands of a judge a path that should not only guarantee legality and so far the judge is fine but also the practicality and the enforceability of the works the fact that it really can then be transformed into concrete works as the PNRR must bring to the system where there are the needs of the companies to sburocratize and simplify with all respect for the courts I think it is a risk it was opportune indeed it was necessary not to give exclusively to a judicial body the function of delegation Instead one could share a path where the Government while maintaining the direction and role shared with judicial technicians but also of the enterprise and the private this iter That is why my analysis of the path was positive in the first instance at least until I saw that trust was not placed Even this time I can't completely calm down I am faced with a delegation and in addition with a delegation in white which is a double delegation with the intervention of the Council of State Mr Minister allow me as an opposition which certainly does not want to pre-constitute criticism but to try to make a contribution of proposition and improvement to give you a signal It is okay not to resort to trust but let us try to involve Parliament and the Government to a greater extent in the roles they play On the substance of the provision may I refer to a passage that we have certainly shared I am referring to the ban on uniting lots a matter which in fact has often prevented our small and medium sized enterprises from working This is a positive aspect that we certainly agree with As Mr Ruspandini will say better in his explanation of vote however we would have liked to see much more about the aspects of simplification deburocratization and speed in the concrete implementation of the works that the various notices and contracts must then guarantee We would have liked the majority to be more open to the role of the opposition more open to the proposals that the opposition always with the seriousness that we would like to distinguish exercised in the Commission Let me give you an example of the amendment to avoid the exclusion of small and medium sized enterprises which had some problems with the DURC or non-final fiscal irregularities In fact let us always remember as an accountant that the findings of the Revenue Agency are not a mantra but the opinion of a party that must possibly be accepted with payment by the taxpayer or contested and judged by the judicial bodies Therefore until the act of ascertainment becomes definitive to me that I am a liberal that act has no value In contracts a small and medium sized undertaking which has an act of verification is excluded This is unacceptable We had therefore asked for remedies especially for those companies which may not have been able to pay and are perhaps also the victims of investigations because of that public administration which does not pay them what is due Therefore a double mockery they are excluded without having definitive acts and the possible irregularity is due to an irregularity of the State the Regions the Municipalities and all those public administrations that have not paid them Minister you will understand that accepting that amendment by Brothers of Italy would be an act of justice towards the Italian system and not a favor to a force of opposition We are in general discussion and I would also like to reflect on the other reforms integrated into the PNRR on which we would also like to see a different attitude from the majority and the government Let us think for example of tax reform in that case too a law of delegation and we also see that the Government wants to maintain absolute control so that we can then we have to tell ourselves and tell the citizens and voters who listen to us legislate through delegated decrees on which Parliament can only give an advisory opinion Therefore heavy delegation on the reforms of the PNRR In the context of tax reform a topic that is making many talk and angry many is the reform of the land registry Mr. Minister beyond what you think of course your thinking is as legitimate and as important as mine you cannot tell the Italians that you are doing the reform of the land register but you do not increase taxes Maybe they wo n't increase tomorrow but if you do the reform of the land register even a fifth grader understands it sooner or later unfortunately more before then taxes will be increased further In this way we will go to penalize even more those Italian citizens and pensioners who perhaps with the liquidation of thirty or forty years of work bought the garage the apartment for the son or the sea We will go to penalize even more those Italian savers who have tried with all their strength to save and instead of being rewarded are discouraged with more taxes This is not how we solve the problems but at a time when the state 's coffers are already in difficulty and even more so are those of the citizens because of the energy crisis that is hitting them in a brutal way Beyond words the various decrees bills and supports have not given answers to today Mr President allow me a few more seconds to remind you of another serious element I believe I am not the only one in this House to receive daily cries of grief from poor people who would like to pay their debts to the State I am referring to the breakdown b and balance accounts and excavations These citizens would like to pay but last year in December they were asked to pay for what had been suspended for a year and a half because of the lockdown Now they are asking and I am asking you Minister to reopen the terms immediately because we must ensure that honest Italians can pay what they owe and want to pay which is also in the interest of the Erario and the Italian State,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#deBertoldiAndrea,"DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is not easy to speak at such a dramatic time for the whole world We are talking about a ridiculous decree and I will explain why I make such a statement while there is a risk that this night a potentially global war has broken out and unfortunately in a context in which our country and Europe have proved themselves and are proving absolutely absent Well in the midst of all this we are discussing a decree on which yet another confidence will be placed and which comes to the attention of the Senate Assembly in the indifference of a Parliament that has become accustomed Only a few days ago my colleagues I remember that only the Brothers of Italy Group actually engaged in the general discussion of this measure said that we would arrive at the imposition of the question of trust and so it was while the President of the Republic had asked the Chambers and of course the Government for a renewed role of responsibility The conclusion is that all those who have filled themselves with joy and have peeled their hands for the words used during the election of our President of the Republic have only allowed a few hours to go back to the vote of confidence So vote of confidence general debates that are deserted explanations of vote of which as happened a month ago written texts are delivered without even being read and announced in Parliament The role of our democracy tends therefore to be more and more assimilable to a form of parliamentary government to a form of subjugated parliament with a government that comes here simply to have a formal authorization to proceed which is not the one for the magistrates but the one that we are asked to give in this case On the subject Mr President I would like to say that only the Brothers of Italy Group can claim to have succeeded in doing something good to the House of Deputies I would stress this in the House because here in the Senate we have not been able to analyse the measure even in the Commissions I would remind you that the Finance Committee of which I am a member has not even expressed its opinion even as a form of unanimous protest because there is no longer even the time and the way of working I certainly express and in any case my personal solidarity with Mr D'Incà because I believe that no Minister for relations with Parliament has had to make certain figures for so many times I personally pay tribute to him for my solidarity but politically the bitterness for what is happening is truly profound We of Brothers of Italy are proud to claim to have obtained the extension for the lowering of the ceiling of cash which therefore for this year does not go up to 1,000 euros but remains to 2,000 euros it would have been really demential at a time when our tourism and our trade are suffering having to ask all this to foreigners who already do not come to Italy because we ask for the green pass and go instead rightly to countries smarter than ours which despite everything perhaps have less problems than we and in which the green pass is not required Not only that therefore with this measure we also make sure that those foreigners go shopping abroad perhaps in neighbouring Austria where they can use the cash without having to resort to other means of payment The result is therefore proudly claimed by the Brothers of Italy while the Government I believe has very little to claim Mr Steger who preceded me spoke of the psychological bonus On the substance I agree I would miss it with a government that has made DAD a philosophy of life and that unceasingly has continued with absurd green passes which are useless as demonstrated by themselves I share this bonus but I was not allowed to present the amendment that I would have liked because of the imposition of trust I would have liked to propose that the cost be borne by Minister Hope since the psychological bonus is to be charged to the political inconsistency of those who wanted to manage the pandemic in this shameful way It is not the citizen and the general taxation who must assume the cost of the psychological bonus but it must be the Minister who unceasingly with the approval of the Government has remained in his place continuing with a health policy that throughout Europe has no equal for closures and restrictions with damage to people otherwise there would be no need for the psychological bonus and the economy as we have seen But it 's not enough What have you done gentlemen of the government on the subject of energy As I said we are at the door of a war that risks being global The energy problem is very serious In our country there has been no energy policy for years nuclear energy cannot be named even if we buy it from the countries that produce it and we do not even have to extract gas because this seems to destroy the environment So no gas After that however companies are no longer able to compete on the markets and families will probably no longer be able to warm up I would like to understand from the Movimento 5 Stars if the TAP pipeline should also be closed Do we also want to stop the gas coming from Africa At least I remember that the position of the main governing party was to close the TAP for the passage of African gas In the same way I remember that the first party of the Dragon Government is against the regasifiers So no gas to store Where then is the government of the best What is the energy response we give to our country and Europe Where do you want to go These are the questions that a citizen an entrepreneur and an Italian industrialist ask themselves and whose answers they would like from their own government On the other hand the psychologist 's bonus comes on the charge of general taxation to remedy the damage of Minister Hope No gentlemen of the majority you have not put together the Government of the best you have put together everything and more to keep the chair something different from the Government of the best The government has failed in health care and is failing in the economy and does not have a strategic vision in energy policy which is crucial at this time The government if it had to talk about extensions had to remember instead the extensions of financing and guarantees for small and medium sized enterprises And none of that I shall begin by concluding Mr President by returning to the issue of energy Since you are all pro-Europeans in words perhaps we are in fact no one has thought of looking at Europe which has renewed its concessions to all hydroelectric power companies We do not however do so with the result that our hydroelectric companies have not made investments for years because logically they cannot count on the time to be able to amortize them This means that our companies that produce and produce energy not investing actually have 30 to 40 less than hydropower production potential In summing up and concluding thanks to those who are against gas we find ourselves with 30 40 billion cubic meters of gas that are not extracted in the Adriatic and a 30 40 percent of less energy production because of the missed extensions which we do not do while Germany France and other European countries do It is a shame and we are tired Mr President I would like to address the only representative of the Government who has remained in this Chamber tell President Draghi that this cannot go on",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,6.8972006,-11.997952,39,"de bertoldi fdi mr president

#deBertoldiAndrea,DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President do I take the floor after two opposition speeches or am I mistaken Mr Marino We have heard what should be a majority force to do an intervention on trust that really seems to include a further political component among the oppositions to this Government What I want to stress is that Parliament 's crisis is becoming increasingly marked here today and that it is defining in a very worrying way almost a conflict between parliamentarism which is the basis of our Constitution and those who on the other hand to the Government in a hierarchical and autocratic way interpret the way in which they play their role You see President today we are having to discuss trust in one of the many decrees law those many analgesic decrees that are responding to the drama of this period and we are doing it with the forty ninth if I have n't hurt the accounts confidence So we 're about to get to 50 trusts something unheard of and unacceptable I would like to devote at least a few seconds of my speech to some positive aspects But before entering into the substance of the provisions that Brothers of Italy managed to obtain in this decree law I want to thank those who put their faces on us I would like to thank the Presidents of the two Commissions Senators Girotto and D'Alfonso who had to put their face on a path of work that has seen Parliament de facto deported as I shall explain its role My thanks also go to the two Undersecretaries to the Undersecretary of War and to the Undersecretary of Freni who took part in the confrontations in the Commission and tried to give a moment of comfort to those parliamentarians who see themselves expropriated of their role You must know but the Italians must know that to support this Government that is to give the vote of confidence to this Government as colleagues are also going to do that in the explanations of vote not to say in the statements outside the Chamber express the greatest criticism of the Government means to remember that the parliamentary committees are not able to carry out their work We arrived here on Sunday afternoon at 6 p.m. full of good will leaving our families to work and modify a government provision We stayed until 3:00 in the morning in Commissions 6th and 10th gathered to try to do this Well we started working and at that time we began to vote on amendments which in fact were not even made known to us Normally it is required that there are at least 24 hours to be able to work on the amendments Instead the rewordings arrived in fact at the time of the vote Therefore Parliament has been deprived of its role I would like the President of the Republic as an expert and defender of the Constitution to give a signal because it is unacceptable Mr President that the Commissions and Members of Parliament cannot do their job Learning about reworded amendments when we have to start voting means that we cannot do our job or at least vote on the amendments not out of knowledge of them but perhaps depending on whether they are the majority or the opposition That would be enough ladies and gentlemen to explain why Brothers of Italy confirms as it has done since the beginning its no to this Government which has really laid a tombstone on the role and functions of our Parliament This however is a decree law that also from a technical point of view expresses its own inconsistency We must remember Mr President that the cover of this decree is absolutely sloppy and inconsistent But we know we have also read the comments that everything is at risk of appeals because you are using the taxation of over -use that in itself can also be an acceptable and acceptable thing at a time like the current one but only so long as you actually tax over -use But when in order to tax over use it is shown that it does not even know the most basic rules of accounting that it does not even know the difference between profit and the taxable VAT and therefore perhaps we end up taxing excise duties when the Government of the best Mr President taxes excise duties it means that it understands nothing about accounting it means that it does not know the VAT law That means he 's making fun of the Italian business system These are the covers Then however when Brothers of Italy responsibly appeals to the majority asking that to cover measures of importance and weight for the development of the country consider the tax feedbacks of the norms the Accounting tells us that we cannot Thus cover may be used which is likely to be rejected by the bodies of jurisprudence and justice but tax feedback cannot be considered This is what the government of the best is doing This is Parliament 's mockery but even more so than the Italians Nevertheless Brothers of Italy tried to remedy the inconsistency in the content coverage and form of the decree trying to bring to the analgesic provided some positivity For this I thank my fellow Members who have supported us I thank the President and the Undersecretaries who as I said before understood the frustration of Parliament and also the constructive and proactive motivations that a political force like the Brothers of Italy wanted to bring in its criticism to a measure in the interest of the country We are therefore pleased and proud to say that thanks to us we have come to a measure that allows us to retrodate the effects of the postponement of deadlines for illness and injury of professionals at the beginning of the emergency Covid and therefore at 31 January 2020 thus covering those who were at risk of sanctions for having fallen ill in the first year of Covid which is the worst We therefore thank the Government for accepting this commitment We are proud to have obtained an extension in the evaluation of the notices of irregularities from thirty to sixty days of the deadline to pay or contest the notices of irregularities of the Revenue Agency responding to requests from both employees of the Agency and fellow accountants and therefore of taxpayers we are proud We are proud and I appreciate that also Senator Marino president of a majority force said this in his speech to have obtained that the fuel bonus is extended to all private employers and not just to companies However we remind the Government that companies are not the whole economic world and therefore now also professional studies will be able to enjoy this bonus I conclude Mr President by reminding the Government of a commitment at least that and I address the correctness of the Secretary of State for War a demanding agenda has been signed for the Government in the first useful decree on energy to reopen the research and exploration of gas in order to achieve energy autonomy It was a commitment that the Government made with Brothers of Italy and with Italians to restore certainties to their future We hope that that commitment that the Government has made without if and without but with us and the Italians will be respected I conclude in the light of the arguments put forward with the denial of the trust of Brothers of Italy to this inconsistent and almost ridiculous analgesic provision

#deBertoldiAndrea,"DE BERTOLDI FdI Mr President I must say unfortunately with a certain custom that this time too we have faced one of the least positive features of this parliamentary term that is to say monocameralism which is now high in principle We were faced with a decree law which in the competent Commission the Finance Committee in which I have the honour to participate did not even have time to examine it arrived but in a few minutes we had to fire it to bring it to the House today Therefore not only monocameralism not only contempt for the tasks of parliamentary institutions but in fact also a failure of any attempt and will to improve as should be done this decree law We have been forced to table amendments in this House that we would have liked to table and debate in the Commission but that was not possible We have tabled them in this House Mr President and we have obviously seen for the sake of time reject all our proposals Entering a little bit on the subject we note that this measure the so called simplification decree is actually another omnibus decree which contains a little bit of everything and in fact comes to be a sanatorium for irregular immigrants Article 43 paragraph 3 in fact represents a suspension of proceedings on illegality and illegal immigrants and is accompanied by paragraph 6 again of Article 43 which provides that in the face of a simple application the offence is extinguished and the residence permit is actually obtained So in a simplification decree law you also introduced a sanatoria on immigrants it does not seem consistent or absolutely agreeable For this reason Brothers of Italy with its behavioral logic could never have voted in favour of such a rule A rule that represents I want to emphasize discrimination against those immigrants President who apply from their home who have not violated the laws who have not wanted to make illegals who were waiting to arrive in our country on the basis of the decree law flows So we also discriminated against honest immigrants against illegal immigrants This is what is contained in the so called Decree Law simplifications a provision that had nothing to do with this argument Mr President many things could have been done if it were to be simplified Just turn around any professional studio talk to any entrepreneur with any craftsman how many simplifications you could do Brothers of Italy as I said had tried to make a further contribution in this direction with the amendments tabled I would like to mention a few here because we cannot think of criticizing without explaining what better could have done For example with reference to Article 3 I believe and I think so many of my fellow accountants who are listening to us can only share that we could simply repeal the periodic VAT clearances In e-invoicing the State has all the elements available without having to ask for further compliance from companies craftsmen traders small and medium sized enterprises and of course their consultants That was a simplification to eliminate the periodic VAT clearances by Article 3 We could also mention Article 9 where you have provided in my view also correctly for so called systemic loss companies for the repeal of the rule that provides for comfy companies so you have given relief to those companies that are at loss not because they like to be at loss but because the crisis of recent years makes it possible unfortunately with some ease to go to loss in at least two of the last five exercises You have therefore removed from the absurd discipline of comfy societies this type of society but I believe that an act of greater simplification would have been to eliminate the whole path of comfy societies I remind those who are not of the profession ladies and gentlemen that the rule provides that companies are taxed are obliged to declare revenues on the basis of a percentage imposed by the State percentage for example on real estate ranging from 4 to 6 percent so we expect revenues that are supposed to be there If they are not at that level they are being taxed in a clearly presumed way A simplification especially at a time like this was not only to turn to companies in systemic loss but to extend the path to all societies of convenience I quote another amendment proposed by the Brothers of Italy I am thinking of repealing at least for the construction sector of the so called reverse charge that is the reversal that occurs in VAT which in fact constantly creates problems for our small enterprises which not applying VAT are serving VAT upstream the one that they must reduce This leads them to go to credit and to have to ask each time refunds that come late in time enough to force them to resort to bank credit in order to meet their liquidity needs So why did n't you simplify by eliminating the reverse charge at least in the construction industry which is so heavily affected by it as by other measures Another step of real simplification would have been for example to raise the limits of the flat rate Why do you continue to maintain at 65,000 euros the flat rate that could be raised to at least 100,000 euros You would have made life easier for many small businesses that have serious difficulties You did n't On the other hand Mr President the logic of taxation has always prevailed of suspicion towards the enterprise those logics which perhaps in the tax delegation contain the land register and therefore the desire to create a parallel income and then clearly create the conditions for taxing the assets of Italians the houses of Italians or perhaps predict as the Secretary of the Democratic Party Enrico Letta a further capital tax on inheritances in order to create further welfare towards young people Perhaps instead it would be enough to use other sources of income to give young people job opportunities according to the principle more work less taxes as proposed by Brothers of Italy The more you hire the less you pay taxes in this way you give an answer to young people without work not giving them a tip perhaps electoral since we are in elections and proposing on the other hand to create a tax that maybe would penalize so many young people who have inherited some assets but who do not have the income to support and be able to pay the tax These are the proposals of a serious party of a party like ours I would also like to refer here to Article 40 c Let there be a question from Brothers of Italy who highlighted how you in the previous decree with a hand gave the tax credits to companies in difficulty who have to pay the gas and energy at high prices but then applied the European de minimis and you went to remove them I remember that you have put this right thanks to a question that in recent weeks Brothers of Italy presented Also in Article 40 c you gave an answer to the problem of the transfer of the credit on the superbonus Finally say what Brothers of Italy have been telling you for months about the previous decrees you cannot have the limit of May 1st because obviously with this limit you did not free the tax drawer of banks and insurance However when you listened to the Brothers of Italy you planned to make a first circular of the Revenue Agency which makes the assignees responsible for the claims against the truthfulness of the credit itself making them jointly with the banks So you canceled the effect that with one hand you had granted Mr President for these and for many other reasons Brothers of Italy will not be able to vote in favour of this decree and we will commit ourselves with the Italians to really doing simple clear reforms in the next legislature and in the interests of all our companies",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#CirianiLuca,CIRIANI FdI Mr President I rise because the Brothers of Italy Group did not vote in favour of the proposal for the timetable that you have just presented to the House and I want to explain why to the Members of this House The proposal in fact provides for a reduction in the time in our opinion incomprehensible and intolerable of the debate on two crucial aspects of political life and of the most recent political debate The first is the reform of the CSM 's judicial system The majority proposal is that given the fact that Minister Cartabia is unable to attend on other days if not Thursday morning Parliament adapts itself to the needs of the Minister rather than the Minister to the needs of Parliament Therefore such an important debate such as the reform of the MSC which has engaged for months in the general debate the parliamentary debate in the Commission is compressed in the Commission and reduced with the presence of the Minister only on Thursday morning On Wednesday afternoon there will be a general discussion in which the Minister will not participate because on other matters involved This is yet another episode that testifies to the importance that the Government attaches to the activity of Parliament Where there are no decrees in question there is this general contempt for the activity of the majority and the opposition I of course speak in the interests of the opposition Mr Balboni and I have tabled dozens of amendments to the Justice Commission not of a destructive and obstructive nature but simply in order to be able to debate them We have already understood that this cannot be done either in the Commission or in this House That 's the first reason The second reason is linked to the other decree monsters a decree that naturally presents the requirements of necessity and urgency There is nothing but a soup decree in which there is anything in it 50 articles with brief hints about the universe because we talk about everything In addition I would remind my colleagues that today there has been a school strike linked precisely to the prediction that the Government makes to include the negotiation and recruitment of school staff by decree- law avoiding the debate with the social partners We were hoping that at least this could be discussed in the Commission in a timely manner adapted to the complexity and scope of the arguments We realized that 's not possible Our proposal Mr Calderoli is to dedicate next week to the work of the committees on the MSM on the reform of the judiciary on Decree Law No 36 which contains various points on the universe and on the whole world also called PNRR and to hold Wednesday and Thursday next the vote in this House having devoted sufficient time to the examination at least in the Commission That is our proposal and we are asking for it to be put to the vote,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,6.9331803,-10.887502,39,ciriani fdi mr president rise brothers italy group vote favour proposal timetable presented house want explain members house proposal fact provides reduction time opinion incomprehensible intolerable debate two crucial aspects political life recent political debate first reform csm 's judicial system majority proposal given fact minister cartabia unable attend days thursday morning parliament adapts needs minister rather minister needs parliament therefore important debate reform msc engaged months general debate parliamentary debate commission compressed commission reduced presence minister thursday morning wednesday afternoon general discussion minister participate matters involved yet another episode testifies importance government attaches activity parliament decrees question general contempt activity majority opposition course speak interests opposition mr balboni tabled dozens amendments justice commission destructive obstructive nature simply order able debate already understood cannot done either commission house 's first reason second reason linked decree monsters decree naturally presents requirements necessity urgency nothing soup decree anything 50 articles brief hints universe talk everything addition would remind colleagues today school strike linked precisely prediction government makes include negotiation recruitment school staff decree- law avoiding debate social partners hoping least could discussed commission timely manner adapted complexity scope arguments realized 's possible proposal mr calderoli dedicate next week work committees msm reform judiciary decree law 36 contains various points universe whole world also called pnrr hold wednesday thursday next vote house devoted sufficient time examination least commission proposal asking put vote
#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Madam President representative of the Government fellow senators one thing can be said with certainty about this decree law it has been carried out unseriously and the lack of seriousness on institutional issues is indeed serious Let 's begin with its drafting this decree law is of May 4 and intervenes on the very delicate electoral matter This is not the first time that electoral decrees are written but I remember that in the past when there were no governments that called themselves the best with a prestigious President of the Council that the world envies us not to mention the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Health that the world is very happy that we have and that it does not go elsewhere the electoral decrees were agreed with everyone including the opposition Today the opposition is very narrow it is a small part of the Senate a small part of Parliament but from the statements we heard during the campaign both for the local elections and for the referendum we have to conclude that there was no agreement even within the forces of the majority because I have heard observations quite rightly and that we have perfectly shared from very high representatives of both Forza Italia and the League who criticized a number of choices made first of all on the date of these consultations From this it can be deduced that even within the majority there has been the seriousness and the institutional correctness of agreeing at least within this majority the content of an extremely delicate measure because intervening by decree law on electoral rules albeit secondary is an issue that has always been addressed in the past with due correctness and caution I am referring to the criticisms that have been made of having chosen as the first Sunday of the administrative consultations and the only Sunday of the referendary round the first Sunday with the schools closed in a very hot time of the year with a great invitation to people to go elsewhere to enjoy this first Sunday of vacation without children having to wake up early on Monday and not to go to vote This is a very serious matter because it is a referendum In addition we have returned to vote in one day after during the previous two years of emergency Covid had voted in two days Moreover the emergency still exists for health care and many other categories or for the masks on the means of transport in this case instead the emergency is not there and you can very well vote in one day while in the past from 1946 to 2013 it had always been voted in two days This time we voted in a single day just to say to the people stay away that justice must not be touched because the order came to us which however contrasted with the intentions of some forces of the majority including the League which had promoted the collection of signatures then became a collection of resolutions of the Regional Councils to which also Brothers of Italy participated But that is not enough The decree law is of May 4 and since it was voted on June 12 there was all the time to do as in the past it was done that is to arrive at the time of the vote by a decree law converted into law Let us not forget in fact that the decree law should be a measure to be adopted in the event of extraordinary necessity and urgency and that in the event that it encounters the rejection of Parliament it would decay in its effectiveness from the outset with enormous institutional problems being precisely elections In fact we have been pushed to the opposite end so even the House examined this measure in the House when it was first voted on 12 June We come here today that we have also voted in the second round a truly incredible thing that shows sloppyness and I would almost say an ostentatious contempt for institutional correctness which is extremely dangerous because this contempt for constitutional rules for fairness and for Parliament as a whole has all the air of being wanted Then as if that were not enough we introduce norms some from the beginning even in the original text which have nothing to do with the matter of the decree law and its characteristic of urgency The decree law in its title refers only to rules for the simultaneous conduct of local elections and referendums as well as for the application of operational precautionary and security procedures for the collection of votes Well in Article 6 3 there is a rule concerning the general elections which apparently have not yet been convened even if we would like to and which we read are being done even in May next year with the longest parliamentary term ever at the constitutional limits There is therefore no necessity and urgency and there is no relevance to what should be the text of the decree law so there was already extraneousness of matter from the beginning As if that were not enough Article 6a is introduced in which some political forces are privileged which will be exempted from voting This is not scandalized we have no particular opposition to the fact that other political forces can participate in the vote but it has been done in a totally disproportionate way taking advantage of the monocameralism that in fact against the Constitution the Government has made a granite rule that can never be overcome favouring the House over the Senate so that only one elected to the Chamber is worth more than one Group to the Senate a totally irrational thing It follows that if we vote soon and apply them without corrective measures which I hope there are on the other hand because of the fairness and fairness of the elections these rules really arriving at the elections there would be a risk of an appeal for inconstitutionality that does not resolve in two days because of the obvious unreasonableness of the norm As a single Member does he is worth more than 13 senators who make up a group It is an irrational thing which has nothing to do with sympathy or dislike towards this or that Group on the contrary it is a matter of having respect for the solemn moment of the elections However since rules have also been introduced in this measure concerning the elections we take the opportunity to say that it would be time to vote because it would also be good if voters could say theirs I recall that when President Scalfaro dissolved Parliament in 1994 to vote he did so on the basis of the authoritative opinion of a great constitutionalist Professor Zagrebelsky who said that when Parliament deviates significantly even if we do not extend from the electoral representation there are all the justifications for resolving Parliament and going to new elections Well I would say that all the electoral consultations tell us that the present Parliament is not representative of the electoral reality I 'll add a thought As if that were not enough trust was also placed Another madness there were 15 amendments perhaps 18 of which six judged impossible were actually much more proposable than that amendment introduced to the House concerning the collection of signatures for political elections not even mentioned in the title of this measure which have no characteristic of necessity and urgency Instead of examining these amendments trust is placed because it is now compulsive I 've heard but I 'm not gonna tell who who looks like there 's some kind of addiction to trust They did n't put it on once I 'm in withdrawal crisis now Colleagues you need a little respect I will conclude with a notation In Article 6 paragraph 3 an extension of this experiment of electronic voting is unduly introduced outside the scope of the provision When this concerns Italians abroad we are in favour because the current voting methods for Italians abroad are such that neither secrecy nor fairness are guaranteed Therefore if there is any way to fix this please come along Perhaps we need to rethink the matter more systematically but we can accept it As for all the other situations let 's go very slowly And we ask the government to explain every detail of the expression of this vote because we want it to count the vote of voters and not those who count the vote as Stalin said that the suppression of democracy was meant to be Let 's go very slowly then We will vote against this decree- law for the manner in which it was presented which goes against

#MalanLucio,Mr President we are faced of course with the vote of confidence in order to prevent the individual amendments from being voted on in the light of the sun in front of everyone with a measure that is part of that great operation which is the National Recovery and Resilience Plan The word resilience which I believe was unknown to more than two years ago has now become indispensable as they did in the immediate post war period with the economic boom when they did not know or at least knew it in very few the word resilience The fear is that this word will remain so and the facts will say something else The decree law under consideration is essentially an omnibus measure because apart from the articles that concern the school issue it concerns all the many aspects of public administration which because of its presence its articulation and its importance in our country essentially affects all the sectors of our nation and daily life The examination was obviously difficult and has already started with the intention of violating what the Constitution prescribes namely that both Chambers examine the measure It has also happened in the past that it was only one House that examined a measure because unforeseen events can happen because the examination can continue for some reason or because changes are introduced at first reading but when you start with this idea obviously there is not much already Today it is 21 June the decree expires on 29 June and still has to be sent to the other branch of Parliament to be examined in the Commission then in this House We are talking about fake exams exactly the same as those of the Senate when the same procedure is followed in the House because if I am not mistaken only Wednesday or Thursday that is to say ten or twelve days after the final date of the provision for both readings the numerous amendments have begun to be examined and voted on which is normal for the majority too and I would say above all given the articulation of the measure I wonder how we can really look at such a measure The reason for these delays is certainly not to be found in the conduct of the Commission but I would like to thank Mr Nencini who has carried it out with great capacity trying to keep the helm bar so as to give a certain order to the work as well as the rapporteurs Senator Rojc and Senator Cangini who have done their work with commitment The reason rather is that all decisions are obviously not taken in this House because the question of trust is simply raised there so either in the majority of governments or not even if no one is obliged to join even if he is part of the majority of governments but we know how things are going but not even in the Commission that is the examination takes place elsewhere I would like to take the example of how the work took place yesterday the Commission after several referrals already last Friday was convened at 12 noon and postponed at 12.30 p.m. then at 13.30 at 14.30 then 15.30 after that there was a qualitative leap the delay instead of being an hour became three hours so the sitting was postponed to 18.30 but only at 19.40 when it was finally decided which text to vote on The Commission has therefore voted in favour of the whole area of which it is quite right to say that it is very important namely school in fact liquidating the text in twenty minutes Now we come to this House and it is difficult to know the work that has been done and even the list of the many amendments that have been adopted There are also some proposed by the Brothers of Italy who intervene mainly on the procedures we had proposed many others on substantive issues but obviously it is already quite difficult to agree between the parties of the majority so for the opposition there is little room but I must say that attention has been shown To say however that this is a parliamentary examination is to say what it is not because the examination takes place elsewhere it is the Government that continues to send all the last changes to what it has decided indispensablely and urgently with so much of recourse to the instrument of the decree law which makes the provision immediately effective and in force except then continue to submit corrections until a few days from the extreme deadline indeed we should have sent this text to the House already twenty days ago as well as amendments introducing new elements When it is said that it is necessary to keep up with the urgency of modern life it would be more appropriate to say that the urgency comes from the changes in the government 's idea and from the new found ones but it is not that they are introduced to keep up with the daily difficulties because here there is a problem this PNRR has been written at European level and has been transposed with the procedures due at Italian level when the emergency was generated by the pandemic by Covid with the very heavy reflections that there have been on the economy Our country in fact has had the primacy for the most substantial collapse of the gross domestic product due to the particularly severe measures more severe than in any other country primacy that has been accompanied by the one due to the number of deaths so obviously there has been some problem Today however it is clear that there are at least other emergencies Among other things it is a recovery and resilience plan generated by an emergency of a health nature this is the basis of everything that allocates very limited resources to health care a very small part of these funds while an ageing society in which medical care evolves continuously and with them the costs should still increase the health costs Today we are in a situation where I think we know the emergency generated by the war in Ukraine is energy What do we do We move forward with the old National Recovery and Resilience Plan Brothers of Italy have repeatedly asked the Italian Parliament and the European Parliament to update it as provided for in European procedures as well as of course the freedom that Parliament if it were really there should have But no we have remained with the previous priorities on the contrary we move forward with the old plan that of environmental fundamentalism in which some axioms and dogmas are taken and applied in an uncritical way to the point that in these days when there are problems of much other kind we think of kicking the continental automotive industry with the announcement of the elimination of endothermic engines by 2035 This together with all the other rules of this type will allow China to absorb new production because it will be able to produce more to the detriment of Europe because there is no limitation to emissions and even less to actual pollution Consequently the result of this fine rule will be the increase in global emissions because given that there is talk of a global problem it does not matter whether they occur in China or in Europe We are thus faced with a very harsh confrontation that between fundamentalist ideological visions and reality This is the worst danger that politics can face to exchange and replace the real reality and problems of people it is not a philosophical fact but a question that touches the real problems of people and citizens who find themselves with exorbitant bills and very high costs who close thousands and thousands of companies and activities with ideology in order to run after environmental fundamentalism which in fact goes in the opposite direction both of the economic and practical interests of citizens and even of the protection of the environment,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,8.983153,-17.755215,39,mr president faced course vote confidence order prevent individual

#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen representative of the Government this draft law comes to the House after a fruitful work done in the Commission and moreover comes from a bill signed by representatives of several groups I would like to thank President Parrini rapporteur for the measure and my colleagues who have contributed to the drafting of this text who responds to a decision of the Constitutional Court that noted the lack of judicial protection in the preparatory proceedings for the elections for the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic The preparatory process in other words is the fundamental passage of presentation of symbols and lists In this way there will be the same guarantees as today with the same speed and in addition there will also be a further possibility of protecting the interests of some formation and party who want to submit lists providing a further opportunity to defend and assert their rights This is not so well known to the general public but certainly very important we know in the past of problematic facts which then have to be addressed as has been said just now even after the electoral result has been achieved that is in times that are obviously no longer adequate At this point what can I say Since the aspect of electoral regulations has also been settled as Brothers of Italy we believe it is appropriate to go and vote and give the Italians the floor This would prevent the Government from having to put its trust in all the measures it presents i.e. the majority of those which Parliament is examining going against what President Mattarella said in his inaugural speech Everyone applauded him and we applauded him on this passage Some people however probably did not understand this because they continue to do exactly what the President has asked them not to do and not for his own personal taste but because the Constitution provides for an important and decisive role for Parliament and indeed entrusts Parliament with the power and power to make laws in accordance with Article 70 of the Constitution For this reason too the Brothers of Italy Group will vote in favour of the draft law under consideration in the hope that the electoral process so modified and perfected can be implemented as soon as possible in order to give the word to the Italians,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,9.659881,-11.775526,39,mr malan fdi mr president ladies gentlemen representative government draft law comes house fruitful work done commission moreover comes bill signed representatives several groups would like thank president parrini rapporteur measure colleagues contributed drafting text responds decision constitutional court noted lack judicial protection preparatory proceedings elections chamber deputies senate republic preparatory process words fundamental passage presentation symbols lists way guarantees today speed addition also possibility protecting interests formation party want submit lists providing opportunity defend assert rights well known general public certainly important know past problematic facts addressed said even electoral result achieved times obviously longer adequate point say since aspect electoral regulations also settled brothers italy believe appropriate go vote give italians floor would prevent government put trust measures presents i.e. majority parliament examining going president mattarella said inaugural speech everyone applauded applauded passage people however probably understand continue exactly president asked personal taste constitution provides important decisive role parliament indeed entrusts parliament power power make laws accordance article 70 constitution reason brothers italy group vote favour draft law consideration hope electoral process modified perfected implemented soon possible order give word italians

#MalanLucio,"Mr Malan FdI Mr President this bill stems from various parliamentary initiatives in the House and one of those measures is by Brothers of Italy The need to change many norms within the local authorities has been felt very much in Parliament the Group of Brothers of Italy has promoted it and has contributed to the promotion of this bill Unfortunately however then he intervened and this is not new because other governments have already done so the scare of a government bill for the overall reform of the single text of the local authorities The good result of this announcement is that most of the proposals are stopped because you have to wait for the government bill There are sketches on the Internet but they have not been officialized in any way let alone transmitted to the Senate which is the other branch of Parliament dating back to October So after six months now almost seven we 're still standing still and we do n't know where it 's gonna go The draft law we are dealing with today therefore carries forward some requirements that have been proposed but much less than those that would have been needed The proposed law of Brothers of Italy provided for a very important thing that is to put an end to the truly embarrassing situation that exists in the Provinces and especially in the metropolitan cities where there is not the popular vote nor the universal suffrage of the citizens but the complex vote in which only mayors and councilors are involved who deserve all our respect and gratitude for the great work they do day by day in the administration a job that has no breaks has no public holidays has no reserved hours and requires a great commitment However if we are in a democratic situation the Provinces and Metropolitan Cities should also be elected by all citizens Then there is a paradoxical situation frankly unconstitutional in my opinion in the metropolitan areas where the citizens of the capital decide who is the so called metropolitan mayor which would then be the new name of the President of the Province also for the municipalities of the whole Province something that is not standing I take the example of my Province Turin which has 800,000 inhabitants who decides who will be the metropolitan mayor of 300 others and passes Municipalities which have among them more than a million inhabitants This is a very unacceptable situation We had carried this point forward with force But then with the excuse that perhaps a government bill would arrive with the fact that someone defends paradoxically this reform completely sudden also because in its time it voted our proposal has been put aside and there are only a few rules left We facilitated the process of this which became a bill to the Senate so that the Senate could express itself But we are not satisfied with all the work done and therefore we express a vote of abstention recalling and emphasizing our great appreciation and the great importance that we attach to the work that is done in local authorities in the Provinces in the metropolitan areas and in the municipalities where thousands of citizens have a basic commitment to volunteering but fundamental for the administration of the territory for many services guaranteed to citizens in small and large municipalities",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#MalanLucio,Mr Malan FdI Mr President your communications reveal the situation we are in which is indeed that of a Constitution that has been bypassed and a Parliament that has been reset mocked and I would say insulted Mr President you spoke it is certainly not your fault of two decree laws which were brought to the attention of Parliament as it were on 24 and 30 December We are still waiting to start voting on 26 November on the same subject In other words Parliament has not yet been able to express its opinion on the Decree Law of 26 November which rains over those of 24 and 30 December and now the media of the regime are preparing the way for a further fearful decree with hallucinating measures which is announced for 5 or 7 January This is in the total impossibility of Parliament to say its own even on the 26th of November largely surpassed by all the measures that are introduced day by day desired and imposed through the media when countries that have greater respect for their Constitution which is not written as in the case of the United Kingdom are abolishing the few restrictions they had In addition to this the Ministers who lie Minister Hope lies here in this House about his interest in blocking the World Health Organization 's investigation Minister Lamorgese lies in the Commission saying that it is not true that policemen are suspended from their salaries even if they are absent or pregnant Someone said that with the super green pass pardon just the green pass you have the certainty to be among people who are infected who do not infect Added to this is the systematic continued and aggravated failure to answer all questions on all Covid issues I have just presented one now about the fact that from both the United Kingdom and Denmark the one in Denmark which is particularly important because it is based on the data of the entire population and the data of the United Kingdom based on the official data of the health agency of that country it appears that vaccines after a certain period have a negative effect Here is a doctor whom I thank for being present as a representative of the Government is unusual the presence of a representative of the Government in a session like this negative effectiveness should make the hands of those who are going to vote on further obligations of this type tremble I ask the government to remember that there is a Constitution that there is a Parliament and that there is the health of the citizens in the middle You can't joke you can't force yourself,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,5.715544,-16.795763,39,mr malan fdi mr president communications reveal situation indeed constitution bypassed parliament reset mocked would say insulted mr president spoke certainly fault two decree laws brought attention parliament 24 30 december still waiting start voting 26 november subject words parliament yet able express opinion decree law 26 november rains 24 30 december media regime preparing way fearful decree hallucinating measures announced 5 7 january total impossibility parliament say even 26th november largely surpassed measures introduced day day desired imposed media countries greater respect constitution written case united kingdom abolishing restrictions addition ministers lie minister hope lies house interest blocking world health organization 's investigation minister lamorgese lies commission saying true policemen suspended salaries even absent pregnant someone said super green pass pardon green pass certainty among people infected infect added systematic continued aggravated failure answer questions covid issues presented one fact united kingdom denmark one denmark particularly important based data entire population data united kingdom based official data health agency country appears vaccines certain period negative effect doctor thank present representative government unusual presence representative government session like negative effectiveness make hands going vote obligations type tremble ask government remember constitution parliament health citizens middle can't joke can't force

#MalanLucio,"Mr President the decree law we are debating comes to us with a procedure which although it is now customary does not make it less unacceptable The Constitution provides for the examination by both rooms but now it turns out that it is impossible while until a couple of years ago it was possible It was always done during the first republic and during the second republic the vast majority of decree laws were actually examined by both chambers almost always without trust Now instead it is clear that a second real reading is impossible because the House held this decree law for fifty of the sixty days within which it must be converted into law so you arrive here and you can no longer say anything The bicameralism which is written in the Constitution and which has been confirmed by a referendum is trampled on It can happen sometimes in the great moment of the emergency in spring 2020 there could also be this reason but the fact that this practice is based on all arguments is truly unacceptable We were all there when the newly re-elected President Mattarella said in his inaugural speech that it is necessary to avoid the compression of the prerogatives of Parliament then of the House and of the Senate and that they must be valued We have all applauded but then among those who applaud there are those who continue to promote this unacceptable way of proceeding against the Constitution Coming to the merits we are now discussing on 17 May the terms expired or restored on 30 April so we are doing a job on the past But who really has the head turned to the past is the Government which continues to establish restrictions that are almost unique in the world paying no attention neither to what happens abroad nor to the Italian experiences nor to the numbers that government bodies find and spread This decree- law which is christened Riaperture should actually be called Richiusure In fact a number of measures which would have expired are prolonged the vaccination obligation for the whole health sector is extended until December the use of masks is extended until 15 June I have a specific question for the government representatives Strangely here there is always the absolute extraordinary need and urgency to approve these decrees but the Minister Hope never sees it Of course all respect to the representatives of the Government to the Undersecretary Sileri who is present with the other Undersecretary but if the Minister showed that it is also important for him and not only to impose obligations limits and prohibitions on Italians it would not be bad So maybe you could explain to us why you lied to Parliament to cover up your failure to renew the pandemic plan I remember that tens of thousands of people died during the pandemic Perhaps someone less would have died if there had been an updated pandemic plan rather than a nearly 20 year old one Perhaps this should be done by the Minister as well as imposing limits and prohibitions I have a question to ask all the members of the government who go abroad where now the obligation of masks is no longer there in some countries there has never been They go abroad without masks and then they come back here and impose them on others In particular at the Brussels Summit two months ago the President of the Council Mr Mario Draghi the Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Luigi Di Maio and all the others present Mr Biden Chancellor Scholz the President of the European Commission Mr Ursula von der Leyen and all the other world summits attended the meeting without mask either outdoors or indoors There was no particular gap on the contrary kisses and hugs All without a mask two months ago I then have a very specific question to ask I spoke too well of Undersecretary Sileri who is now gone There 's only one undersecretary left very busy in phone conversations However I would like the rapporteur and above all the representative of the Government to reply to this simple question why does the President of the Draghi Council go to the international summits without a mask and embrace people even of a certain age He himself is not very young and therefore there is a greater risk Then however he comes here and obliges six year olds even if they go to childhood school to put on the mask until June 15th Where 's the criterion Because when there was that meeting in Belgium it was not an exception made for the occasion In Belgium for months as almost all over the world there is no obligation to wear a mask Just as there is no obligation not to put it If President Draghi thinks the mask serves to reduce and counter the pandemic why did n't he put it on He was free to put it on and instead he did n't put it on Then he comes here and forces six year olds to wear a mask I want an answer Given that the Government will place trust I ask Minister Hope because it would be nice for him to come and put trust or in any case to Minister D'Incà who will probably be present to answer this very simple question I remember that there are studies that talk about the possible negative consequences of the use of masks It is evident that it increases the reinspiration of carbon dioxide something much is said about other purposes It is evident that it causes effects that make people uncomfortable and even skin irritations In the educational field it greatly reduces the interaction with the teacher being able to see in the face the teacher and for the teacher to see the students is very important Otherwise if the mask were useful we 'd always keep the mask Just remember that Dr. Giovanni Rezza director of the prevention sector of the Ministry of Health wrote a letter in response to those who asked him saying that he is not in possession of studies that demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the masks Let 's remember that this virus is very mutated At first the situation was very different Now with these variants which are far less deadly but are much more contagious from many studies it appears that there is no difference On the Cochrane library which is a large database of researches an accurate study was published which explains that it was not possible to demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of surgical masks compared to their non-use nor has a clear difference been demonstrated between the surgical mask and the FFP2 mask This is just one example A few days ago a study by Professor Beny Spira came out in which he even says that according to some analyses the number of people infected is greater where the mask is used more This among other things is the case of Italy which has worse numbers than others and obligations equal to no other country Finally on 22 July last President Draghi said that with the green pass there would be the security of being among people who are not contagious and therefore not infected His claim that he never denied and for which he never apologized was denied 5,181,909 times Since that day this is the number of Italians who have infected themselves with the Covid 19 despite having the requirements for the green pass In fact they are even more because there are another 2,300,000 infected among those who had done two doses for more than four months Since the green pass lasts six months and until 31 January it lasted even nine months probably there are many more Of these remaining only to those who have three or more doses of vaccine or two doses for less than four months 62,000 have ended up in hospital 3,000 in intensive therapies and 9,805 have died Perhaps someone thought that they would no longer observe prudential behavior since they had the green pass and that the President of the Council had said that we were safe So when you communicate on such matters you do n't have to make propaganda you have to tell the truth This is what we ask truth PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator Parrini is enlisted to speak You have the right to do

#RautiIsabella,"RAUTI FdI IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government we welcome the fact that the measure has been scheduled today in this House I mention only the short title to revise the model of Armed Forces to delegate to the Government for the revision of the national military instrument We welcome today 's debate and we hope for the adoption of the measure Above all before this I would like to express my satisfaction with the work carried out in the Chamber before the Senate in the Commission defended by the Brothers of Italy Group which has already worked since the beginning of this legislature for an amendment of Law n. 244 of 2012 Our Group has worked across the board with the other political groups to arrive at a single text and the proposed amending law that we are discussing today So there has been and I stress this a constructive climate in the Commissions both in the House and in the Senate around this important fundamental provision I would say that it was neither easy nor difficult I would say that it was necessary and useful For who and for what Evidently for a common goal the well being of the military of our Armed Forces a greater functionality of them and I would say a greater dignity and recognition of the value of the commitment of our Armed Forces It is clear I have no difficulty in saying this that each of us has given up something we ourselves have withdrawn a number of amendments and we have done so because we could not miss the opportunity to have the reform approved by the end of the parliamentary term As far as the programme is concerned we have also signed the agenda for the first time by Mr Gasparri who is a bit of a shared agenda which was then signed by all the parliamentary groups This is because it is a fundamental reform that must affect as already mentioned Law 244 of 2012 which provided for a reduction of staff to create a professional model that in principle is of course acceptable but then there is reality there are the effects of application there is life in barracks Whoever visited us or who like me has also served us knows what life is in barracks that is the daily life of those who wear a uniform It is evident to all those who have been interested in it that the negative effects of Law No 244 were already seen they were seen in the meantime in a saving that has not been but above all in the ageing of the staff and in an operation limited by the constraints that it was pushing against an increasing capacity specialization and formation of our armed forces operating both in the homeland and abroad On this I open a small parenthesis because also at international level colleagues where we gain attention and appreciation of everyone for how we work in our peace missions and in international civil and military cooperation missions only in the current year we have 44 international missions and 7.598 committed units So how do we how do we think we can achieve a cutting of staff even if it is progressive in the face of growing needs in the face of growing international commitments in the face of emergencies It is not possible to remove resources and reduce staff I think that no sector could ever bear a reduction of 40,000 people in fact it was expected to increase from 190,000 to 150,000 people in addition to the cutting of civilians I repeat no sector could bear a staff cut of 40,000 units at the same time responding to every need every service every growing emergency I stress up to the pandemic from Covid The ageing of staff and the shortage of staff call for action Attention ladies and gentlemen we are now removing a noose from the necks of our armed forces because that is what I call Law 244 It is clear however that this is only a step and a starting point We must continue to deal with the armed forces we must continue to take seriously the issues of defence and security which are crucial and central to geopolitics and national interests My colleague Mr Urso in his previous explanation of vote also stressed and articulated what it means today to be committed to international security and international peace It is not only a question of deterrence but also an important one it is a strategic and military policy it is stability to be guaranteed at international level while the threat to collective security is spreading and traditional threats are added to those of the hybrid war To the classic domains of land air and sea are added the new brand new ones of cyber of space of the technological challenge It really is a universe to be faced with for which we must be equipped As my colleague Mr Urso reminded me I say this to those who have had some second thoughts I do not want to make controversy today but memory is memory we must respect the international commitments made and allocate 2 of GDP to military defence expenditure When we remembered it we created a backlash in the outgoing majority But we must be consistent we cannot think of cutting resources or not achieving goals and then demanding the maximum from our Armed Forces Let 's get back to the topic Our armed forces are heritage institution symbol value and operational reality at home and internationally guaranteeing peace and security Why is this reform important I just want to point out a ride This reform says enough to the military precariousness It introduces the system of the stop of the volunteers in fixed stop during the first service of three years you will be able to access with a contest to the next fixed stop of three years with a transit in permanent service This means finally declaring war on the precarious it means improving the conditions of economic treatment and the legal status of the person who dresses the uniform Enough with the insecurity in the Armed Forces When the precarious becomes stable and becomes indefinitely it means that something has not gone and is not going I 'm gonna finish Today Parliament is reappropriating its role and function I mean because it is important We have also reached this agreement for a superior and common objective in the name of the military forces of the armed forces of the country We have done this for a higher objective for a higher common interest and for a national interest that we call homeland",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#RautiIsabella,RAUTI FdI Mr President before we make our proposal for a timetable I would like briefly to explain why we are going to vote on the timetable this morning not having reached the necessary unanimity at the Conference of the Leaders yesterday Unanimity has not been achieved because Brothers of Italy does not agree with the proposal for a timetable which is also abstract because we still do not know how exactly the work of the Commission will be carried out which wants to insert a little time for Thursday evening I want to be clear it is not of course the possible night or night work that frightens us What frightens us is the way we proceed which we might call a drift In fact at the previous Conference of Leaders we had established a timetable with timetables for the beginning and end of work then necessarily modified because we are faced with a lack of work by the Commission Let me explain we should discuss the bill No 2488 of conversion of Decree Law No 221 of 2021 to which the Government 's amendment added other aspects It is therefore an important act concerning health health surveillance and the many measures to control the epidemic The Commission has been summoned and disconcerted more than once and has basically not yet begun its work beyond the general discussion We of Brothers of Italy do not like to do and undo the calendar according to the criterion of haste bending the times that serve the discussion and the comparison for some requirements that do not put first as should be done the importance of the measures and also the function of this Assembly The question in short is certainly not the wristwatch but and we stress this it is a political one I would also add that we are less than a week away from President Mattarella 's words of call during the second oath and I refer in particular to the expression not to compress and not to expand the speaking time in this House which is then conceptually a healthy and sacred principle I would ask colleagues in the League if they can keep quiet because it is only a minute Thank you for your kind attention I said that it is a question of defending the principle of the centrality of Parliament The decree law is very important it deserves time and means of discussion and the many amendments deserve it so we cannot focus on Thursday evening 's slippery weather I can also imagine the hasty way in which the debate will take place with the resignation of someone to discuss the amendments to do before or as has happened in other cases with explanations of vote lodged at the Presidency table and not discussed in this House accompanied even by a freeing applause thus giving up to perform a function These are speeches that then come out because we are not in a bubble and we do not want to finish We therefore think that this hypothesis of rehabilitating the calendar benefits the needs of those who want to return home and not of the discussion indeed it sacrifices the process Why was I talking about drift Because this is not the first time ladies and gentlemen that we must call to mind the importance and centrality of the debate to be held in this House Brusio PRESIDENT The debate is closed Excuse me Senator Rauti Colleagues you must absolutely decrease the tone of the voice or interrupt waiting for Senator Rauti to finish the surgery Please Senator Rauti RAUTI FdI Thank you Mr President for helping me listen I think those who are not interested can safely go out and come back for the vote As I said unfortunately this is not the first time that we have to undergo this if we want to call it elegantly unsystematic I am thinking for example of the times of discussion and approval of the budget law a dramatic thing that we cannot forget both here and in the House with the renunciation of explanations of vote in some cases as I have already mentioned not to mention the last two years characterized by excessive recourse to the decree of urgency and I must say and repeat the almost compulsive appeal to the votes of confidence which frankly are not explained in the face of a maxi-maximity that includes all but us So given the lack of interest in this House I come to our proposal to amend the timetable President in Office of the Council FR Mr President ladies and gentlemen considering that tomorrow is the day of the Foibe remembrance and that tomorrow afternoon there are also demonstrations in this House as well as outside this House we propose that tomorrow morning we begin the debate as planned always in keeping with the work of the Commission of which we do not really know how to do so from 9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and then continue on Friday Then again with regard to the calendar I remind everyone that there are also Saturdays Sundays Mondays and Tuesdays it is not written anywhere that we have to work or pretend to work in the evening to close the work on Fridays at lunchtime That is our proposal,#group.FdI,Fratelli

#FaggiAntonella,Mr President Senators I will not dwell on the technical aspects of the measure because they have been well expressed by my previous colleagues who have touched on very important articles of the measure that we are going to vote on on This is certainly one of the few times when we have had a measure that has no resources as the rapporteur has said in his statement In fact given the different passages we had to try to legislate on a structure that had a small economic content 30 million This seems at first glance a situation that can give a poor fruit sour that has no meaning Instead in my opinion it is when there is no money or the money is few that you have to put your whole soul and brain in order to try to get something good out As long as there is money the amendments are being prepared 50 million here 10 million there 40 there it is content and not content but it is certainly much more evident the media and political emphasis than to make an amendment or to strive to produce an amendment without economic support which perhaps opens up a range of possibilities and manages to solve a series of situations completely blocked I have not honestly tabled an amendment to this measure but I have followed other colleagues amendments I committed myself because I liked it because it was a very cerebral measure If many of those amendments had been taken into account in a very precise way they would certainly have raised and helped many still unresolved situations Let me give you an example Senator Cantù spoke about the medical issue but hers was certainly a costly amendment so she could not go But there was also the amendment by Senator Alessandrini which referred to a series of municipalities that have economic difficulties in closing a budget and had to find a legal formulation to get out of a impasse Among other things these are municipalities which today in a further critical situation because we have almost the war at home and have made themselves available to help refugees as well as providing essential services will find themselves in a state of uncertainty There was no money but we definitely had to put our heads in more depth I would like to take the example of Mr Fregolent who was already well and who does not know why although there was money and the Ministry 's green light he was lost Then I come back to repeat something I have already said before We are in a state of economic health financial and social emergency We should also be in a state of emergency and give up and I repeat give up for a moment the banks not on an institutional level go a little further and try to fix all those situations in which if for us two months they are nothing for those outside instead there are many I conclude my speech by addressing my very nice colleague Zaffini of Brothers of Italy who has shocked a whole series of very negative situations about how we are not able to make of necessity virtue Forgive me however colleague apart from the empty Chamber which is not good and is not just about you but you who are the expression of the minority should have had the whole claque behind to applaud you strongly for what you have said because that is the only way it has meant what you say in relation to what your party supports outside and within this Chamber As for the others I cannot say otherwise because indeed such a measure which has no economic support but which has the strength to give out should have seen the House full the support of the rapporteurs and the Commission which has tried in every way to do what it could because those who They must understand that ours is not a job for high end wage earners we are people who try at least as far as I am concerned to solve in all problematic ways

#BalboniAlberto,Mr President ladies and gentlemen we are going to examine and vote on a reform which will be completely useless for many parts or even will have the effect contrary to what is proposed in words It will therefore be a harmful reform that does not address and resolve any of the central issues that are at the heart of the debate on justice policy today and above all does not solve the serious lack of credibility that has been created because of the well known events that have involved summits of the judiciary and politics Public opinion no longer trusts the judiciary and I do not believe that this reform will reverse this trend Unfortunately now in this Parliament what we approve of one branch cannot be touched on by the other What the House approves cannot be touched by the Senate In the Committee on Justice we have examined so many valuable amendments which apart from the most politically sensitive ones in many cases helped to solve obvious technical and legal shortcomings Yet they were all rejected Mr Cucca spoke just now Brothers of Italy voted for all or almost all except perhaps one or two the amendments proposed by Mr Cucca who were certainly valuable However we cannot understand the reason why yesterday we held hours and hours of debate in the Justice Commission and then see today the withdrawal of all these amendments by not only Italy Viva also by Forza Italia and other groups From the show I wish I could but I can't Ladies and gentlemen we are here to carry out a legislative function which cannot meet the criterion of wish but I cannot In fact if you wanted there was time to do some surgical interventions in this legislation that makes water from all sides and you could have returned to the House for the third final reading The truth is that the internal balances of the majority are very precarious and always directed to the compromise to the decrease Mr Cucca referred first to the need that at least in a law on the judicial system it should not appear that someone is more equal than the others I am thinking for example of the head of the legislative office who is excluded from incompatibility while having a prominent political role compared to many other figures who on the other hand are included in the list of incompatibilitys Orwell taught us that when one is more equal than the other we are close to a dictatorship None of the problems that are most relevant to public opinion and above all to those involved in the work that are now seeing justice that is no longer able to carry out its task to the full have been tackled None of these problems have been addressed The main is the mix the contiguity the exchange of favours between politics and the judiciary Attention however when we talk about combining politics with the judiciary we use euphemism because we should be more precise and talk about commissions between the high summits of a particular political party called the Democratic Party and summits of a certain member of the judiciary because this is what we are given the interceptions that have been read and studied by all of us and the interview books the first and the second that Palamara wrote with four hands with the director Sallusti I am referring to the combination between a political party which in fact has always had this tradition Mr Pillon mentioned Gramsci about it and a certain member of the judiciary which is the arm of that political party within the judiciary Ladies and gentlemen how can one think that the problem of the overpower of the Democratic Party within the judiciary and the problem of the overpower of a certain current of the judiciary can be resolved by excluding that the magistrate applying for the MSC should collect signatures The problem is not the signatures but the votes the magistrate who goes to ask the votes if not in the current through a transversal agreement of do ut des The electoral system that in this bill is drawn paradoxically but perhaps not so much because those who wrote it are the same magistrates who are within the Ministry of Justice emphasizes and multiplies to the umpteenth power the contractual power of the currents because it institutionalizes the possibility of agreements between lists and between candidates There is a heterogeneity of the aims of course because if the aim was to remove power from the currents ladies and gentlemen with this new electoral system instead you add power to the currents We have tried in every way with our amendments which we will then talk about when we enter into the substance and discussion of the individual elements to draw a different and alternative system such as that of the draw perhaps with a draw after selection or with an election after draw there are so many solutions that we can find in order to ensure that the contractual power of the currents their overpower is removed The real question to ask however is how many really want this In fact we know very well that at a time when for example it is about all the most important offices in Italian prosecutors it is important to have a say in the appointment of a Chief Prosecutor to the Public Prosecutor of Rome Milan Naples or another of the most important prosecutors in Italy A party that has soliciting friends is certainly favored over a party that does not have soliciting friends This also explains why in some cases investigations go on in record time and in other cases investigations never really go ahead It is not with the bill that we examine and with this electoral system that the problem of the overpower of currents and politics in the judiciary is solved It is not with the solution you have adopted to put an end to the other very questionable phenomenon of revolving doors that solves the problem Ladies and gentlemen when a magistrate applies it has no relevance whether he is elected or not The moment he 's running he takes sides And at the time of the election we lose the image of impartiality that must have the judge and the citizen when he sees that he is a magistrate does not pose the problem whether he has been elected or not the problem arises knowing that the political orientation of the citizen under trial is another whether that judge is really able to undress himself of his ideology of his political belonging and to judge him serenely Lost time I 'm a lawyer and I guarantee you that many times the first question the client asks me is not whether that judge is good competent or quick in decisions whether he studies cards or does things approximateally No The first thing you ask me is if that judge is right or left Unfortunately the answer is quite easy Because even if there are some right wing judges he carefully thinks he 's far enough out of it Therefore those who take sides elected or not must not return to judicial functions this is the real turning point In this sense the amendments of Brothers of Italy go In thanking you for the time you have given me Mr President I shall conclude with one final consideration Colleagues the amount with which you can read the entire bill do you know where it is In Article 21 which raises the components of the MSM from 24 to 30 But how We have voted for a constitutional reform with which we have reduced the members of Parliament by 37.5 per cent and we raise the CSM components by a quarter Attention I am not just talking about Article 21 and the six additional components I am talking about Article 26 and I am going to talk about it better when we come to the substance of the amendments because because of the increase provided for in Article 21 it raises the contracts of continuous collaboration from the current 26 to 62 If it 's not a present to the currents tell me what it is,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,11.28175,-11.229195,39,mr president ladies gentlemen going examine vote reform completely useless many parts even effect contrary proposed

#AlessandriniValeria,"Madam President fellow senators members of the Government as a group we have tried in any way to improve this bill by tabling many amendments as we did when we examined other measures These are proposals that arise from listening to the citizens to the productive categories to the civil society actors who come from the real country and who alas in many cases have been ignored The impression is that at least in part an opportunity has been lost to carry out a measure that would have really reached the heart of the problem and would have given back breath to many categories Courageous measures are needed and that is what we are asking for We will vote in favour of this bill for a sense of responsibility it is a measure that tries to temporarily buffer the situation and in a minimal way a part of the criticalities and urgency of the country These are non-resolutionary measures In the future we need a measure in which the Government takes care of all the emergencies trying to lower the costs of the raw materials that increase to take care of the workers starting from the fragile subjects from their families and I am referring to the many Italian families that because of the increases in the cost of living can no longer reach the end of the month Turning to the measure under consideration there is one aspect that I would like to stress in relation to which as a group we have tabled specific aid proposals on several occasions I am referring to the theme of the municipalities in failure I am thinking of my city Terni administered today by the League and the center right but victim of a previous bad administrative management which caused the breakdown of the agency Like Terni there are Potenza and other municipalities which face the difficult situation of an inherited disaster Anyone in this House who has been a local administrator and has had the honour like me to represent the citizens as city councilman city councilman or first citizen knows the difficulties they encounter every day in managing a city Local administrators make daily mortal jumps with mirabolous enterprises to manage the complex municipal machine with the few means available The normal and multiple criticalities of an administration have been exacerbated by the pandemic and more recently by the war in Ukraine and institutions are very hard to carry out everyday activities and to guarantee citizens even minimum services It is already considerably difficult and complex to carry on the ordinary administration imagine what it can mean to manage a municipality in economic failure at a time like this characterized by many risk factors Well even in this draft law as on many other occasions we have tabled more amendments in order to help the municipalities in failure In this case our amending proposal has been transformed into an agenda I am aware that the economic commitment to this type of municipality is very costly but I believe that the Government 's task must also be this The Central Executive must provide local administrators with the tools to be able to govern and manage the institution at its best it is a duty to which the Government cannot escape The failing municipalities should be a priority because the citizens the services offered to them and their quality of life should be a priority I would have preferred that the Government had already taken charge of the provincial capital municipalities that are experiencing this particular economic situation However I welcome the commitment that has finally been given to us by the Finance and Treasury Commission with responsibility The Commission will include in the first useful measure the proposal of the League aimed at preventing municipalities such as Terni and Potenza from going into default An appreciable result that confirms the great commitment of my party and that strengthens our closeness to the needs of the territories One aspect of this measure that I would like to stress is the work done I can only welcome the adoption of our amendment which will allow more than 100,000 people to continue working It is thanks to this amendment that it becomes possible to exceed the time limit of employment beyond the twenty four months of workers engaged under an indefinite employment contract by the Employment Agency and sent on a temporary mission to the same company with the extension until 30 June 2024 for workers engaged under an indefinite employment contract by the Employment Agency without this determining the user to establish an indefinite employment relationship with the employee administered This eliminates what was in fact an obstacle to the continued employment of the workers being administered The need to postpone the entry into force of the 24 month limit to 30 June was to save at least 100,000 jobs put at risk by the employee turnover and the introduction of this time limit 18.22 Alexandrini followed I would like to thank the Undersecretary for his valuable work for his work and social policies Senator Tiziana Nisini who among other things summoned a Table to the Ministry to find a solution with all the representative associations involved I would also like to thank the entire Group of the League for its efforts in this situation too to ensure that this amendment is also accepted A valuable job even more for 100,000 families It is thanks to the League to the Government that these goals have been achieved and this is also the real meaning and motivation of our presence in the Executive to improve the quality of life of Italians PRESIDENT The debate is closed Senator Calandrini is registered to speak You have the right to do so",#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo

sense that the words of the Head of State in his speech of settlement will remain as an isolated cameo while respecting what should be the role of Parliament And to think that there is n't even an excuse for the emergency state anymore It is clear that what we have seen now has become a sad practice which is consumed on every measure continuous postponements of the sessions Commissions that do not work during the day and then are forced to final sprints at night in confusion when colleagues have difficulty in understanding what they are voting on with a method that tears apart all the regulations and all the parliamentary practices We have tried as patriotic opposition also in this measure and also in this climate to make our contribution to addressing the difficulties of our nation We really pick up very little in terms of listening from the government and the political forces of majority We will insist on the proposals as we are used to doing because we want to make opposition to this Government which shows that months ago we were symbolically right in saying that we cannot give life to defined governments of broad understanding which then become only long awaited governments because on every measure to be undertaken it is clear that there is the need to reach compromises which are unfortunately always downward I would like to focus my speech on Article 36 of this measure with which the posts for the Covid staff of schools have finally been extended This is an untenable necessity which we had supported through an amendment even in previous measures You always get late because it was obvious that our school could n't go on without this staff and we re-launch saying that it wo n't be able to face the new school year without this staff We do not understand why this decision could not already be adopted last month i.e. before those posts came to an end Thousands of people were sentenced to a Dante 's life after serving in the interest of the State and until the last day they did not know if they were to remain in service By the way we are talking about people who live hundreds of miles away from home and their families and who of course had to confirm their rents and all their life commitments We do not understand why they could not be given time and peace of mind by adopting our amendment However we are pleased that the government and the majority have finally convinced themselves and found the resources to do so Those who have experience as local administrators are well aware that school years are preparing well in advance and therefore if we do not want the next school year to start with more and more serious uncertainties we must take certain decisions from now on which we have tried to propose with our amendments to Article 36 We are delighted that the commitment has been made to those eligible for primary school and children but we do not understand in this regard too what method the Commission has followed because in the presence of equal amendments both in the content and in the text those with the worst numbering are approved For us it is not important to place a flag but the form is substance and here at the highest level of the Italian institutions this principle should never be exempted instead it is punctually betrayed and put aside with serious prejudice to the rights of all parliamentarians and in particular of the opposition which legitimately and with a great sense of duty must realize its role of control of the government 's activity Unfortunately this is a practice and the Government self defined of the best is incapable of understanding these elementary dynamics It is also for this reason of course that the union acronyms and the whole world of the school are forced to announce a general strike for the next 30 May If you had listened to our proposals and also those of many other Members of the majority who are obviously disappointed that they were not heard this strike would probably have been averted and above all we could have presented ourselves to the new school year with many more certainties However this is unfortunately a way of acting by the Government and also testifies to the inability of the majority to be heard which is confirmed in all things I am thinking for example of the events of local authorities and of the deadline of 30 April which for a period have been mentioned to extend for the final statements which the municipalities have serious difficulties in presenting Nothing has been done about it and now that the deadline has been exceeded an extension is announced to the next 31 May which is now on its way How do you plan to govern the processes of a nation by extending in a posthumous way deadlines that have already been exceeded and advanced It is evident that this government which is a giant with clay feet waves more and more Then we say to you if you are not able to govern and this experience and this political season have worn out it is better to return the word to the Italians immediately through the elections so that they can choose a majority that gives a legitimate government to our nation

#IannoneAntonio,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen if there were no appreciable circumstances in the serious international framework that has been determined the sad practice of fleeing on Thursday would have been staged today We are in the presence of an omnibus measure by its very nature the milleproroghe which is moving towards a new vow of confidence That is what Mr Zaffini said we will be in front of the fortieth vote of confidence in a year of the Dragons Government which starts to beat all the records tearing even those that we would have considered unsurpassed by the Monti Government The majority renounces about four hours of general discussion Everyone applauded President Mattarella 's speech when he called for respect for Parliament 's prerogatives and among those who applauded there are the same Members who today give up the general debate and who over the past few weeks have also applauded the representatives of the Groups who invited them to give their speech in an explanation of vote If we are not first of all consistent with the role that the people have entrusted to us electing us as their representatives by whom do we want our high function of representing the nation to be respected We must call for respect for Parliament of course but no one can give us respect if we are not able to do it first We continue with the method of urgent decree in many creative cases We are witnessing without the Commissions being able to play their full role We continue in a de facto monocameralism which mortifies on alternate plates one branch or the other of Parliament And we do not understand why Members are not given the power to perform their duties to the full We understand very well that we are in front of a government that is a giant with clay feet This is certified by the fact that the Government has been beaten four times on a thousand pronge in the House Commission This is certified by the fact that last week here in the Chamber the government was beaten three times with a level of continuous confusion We of Brothers of Italy with our leader Giorgia Meloni had said that it is not possible to give life to governmental experiences in which apples are put together with pears When it comes to choosing and deciding according to ideal guidelines and concrete beliefs this is the result a continuous conflict which our nation pays through the mortification of Parliament 's role It is not possible then to see the President of the Council who gets angry and calls everyone from the free exit If the Dragons method of the last year of government were to be that of the permanent threat of resignation in the drawer then dear colleagues the advice is that if there is such a hurry to go home on Thursday it would have been much better to return to the vote The Italians would have satisfied you very gladly In any case just to claim some results that says a lot about our way of understanding the function of opposition also in this provision Brothers of Italy has brought many proposals Some of the majority 's proposals however are proposals that you have rejected on other measures demonstrating that you are also able to subtract with little dexterity what is the work done by others We would like to stress the result that we have achieved with the adoption of an amendment that has raised the cash use ceiling from 1,000 to 2,000 euros This is the only measure that will give some oxygen and the possibility to revive some consumption those consumptions that you have destroyed through the unsavory choice of the use of the green pass a measure that has served absolutely nothing only to limit individual freedoms It has had no real effect from a health point of view but it has been economically devastating In conclusion we are already at the end of the debate although we are at the beginning of the morning 's work everyone lives in his own world but it seems to us that the world does not live in each of us Therefore if you have the opportunity in this last year to demonstrate with a glimmer of dignity and pride that Parliament is not the passcard of the

#IannoneAntonio,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen of the Government Mr Calandrini Mr Zaffini and Mr De Bertoldi have already said what the Brothers of Italy think of this measure but let me say having listened carefully to the speeches of colleagues from the other majority groups that the measure does not satisfy anyone The decree law at our examination should have found and given other answers to the areas of life of our nation and instead the government lacks courage The truth is that in order to put in place the resources necessary to give real and effective answers economic commitments of another kind or at least political choices that go in the opposite direction to what the Government has chosen should be assumed a new budgetary deviation We say this with the credibility of those who while being a force of opposition have shown that they are able to vote for this necessity in other times and moments of the pandemic We do not want to help the Government it never convinces us from the first moment but we never back down when we have to help Italy and the Italians I wonder what is the point of an amendment by the majority when one is aware already from the principle that there is no possibility of intervention even on this measure More than 2,300 amendments certify from the outset that we are in the presence of an absolutely insufficient decree-law Then through the perverse I say system of warnings of confrontation monco also in the Commission let us be honest this activity serves only to mock categories and subjects who on the other hand legitimately expect aid from the State These are people who in the pandemic have continued to do their duty with serious difficulties and little changes if the provision is called refreshments or support because you have not changed the philosophy of intervention The minutes I have left I want to dedicate to an issue that as a party we have tried to point out to you in the importance it takes trying to stay at least on the emergency if it is not possible to stand on an overall and strategic vision which is missing In fourteen days on March 31 more than 55,000 people who have sent the Italian school forward will see their contract expire There are fifteen days left and still those people who are serving the state do not know if their duties will be extended We fought with an amendment We had hope that this problem could be resolved so that the Italian school could move forward There are no resources after so much hope had been given and it was said that other political forces had also tabled the same amendment We tell the government we still want to believe it I say this to the Undersecretary Guerra to whom I must acknowledge with intellectual honesty that on other occasions he has given testimony of sensitivity to the problems of the school We are strict but we are also able to be honest intellectually I would like to refer specifically to the question which has allowed with our amendment a shield civil criminal and administrative for school leaders An effort must be made to extend this staff to June 2022 You still do n't promise things you wo n't do or confused solutions kicking the ball forward and telling them you 'll find resources in the DEF to extend by a month until April 30th We give answers to those 55,000 people and their families people who have gone to work even 1,000 miles away Instead of dissipating billions in unproductive income of citizenship and subsidies let us make sure that those who have worked those who work and those who

#IannoneAntonio,IANNONE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen of the Government I have listened to emphatic words about this measure but sincerely as Senator Maffoni our colleague in the Group and member of the Commission has already announced we believe that this is a missed opportunity to give a fully concrete and incisive response to a world that has been waiting for you for years We are also very sorry because for the umpteenth time the amending proposals of Brothers of Italy which never has a preliminary attitude have been absolutely ignored We had all the intention of making a contribution that would significantly improve the measure which for a long time was blocked in the Commissions in view of the evidence that there were also very obvious political conflicts which culminated when the Government was beaten on an amendment tabled by a majority representative on the delicate issue which we too have been proposing and proposing for years of the supervision of the management of lyrical symphonic foundations The majority have split but this is not a novelty in the light of what is now happening in the usual way in the Commissions However our critical abstention position that we will express does not prevent us as our intellectual honesty on the other hand always allows us from recognizing that the delegation of the show certainly introduces new elements even if not decisive in the precariousness of the workers of the show and in the face of the need to guarantee the cultural sector A limited answer has come I repeat practically Tachipirina and vigilantly awaited to the problems that the Commissions of Chamber and Senate education have had the opportunity to study and deepen in a very exhaustive way Therefore I would like to make a critical point first of merit and then of method moving from the technicality of the more political issues We have tabled amendments for the reform of the Single Fund for performance in the National Arts Fund it is present in Parliament at the first signature of my colleague Mr Mollicone della Camera who is also our head of the Culture Department a bill for the revision of the Single Fund for performance which eliminates in particular the distorting role of consultative commissions as requested by the categories as in the case of the Live Show Movement and promotes the introduction of the deduction of cultural consumption necessary to relaunch the demand for culture that we have proposed several times both to the Chamber and to the Senate in more measures and budget laws The left is always in favour of the deduction of cultural consumption but then never votes for the measure These are issues on which instead Brothers of Italy has always been at the forefront alongside the categories as in the case of Federculture so much so as to include incentives to demand for culture I am thinking of the deduction of cultural consumption and the reduction of VAT to 4 for cultural products in the party 's government program since its foundation We very much welcome the recognition of the profession as a live entertainment agent as well as the strengthening and extension of the functions of the entertainment observatory and the establishment of the permanent table in the entertainment sector the subject of our agenda which was voted on in the Chamber of Deputies It should be pointed out that the delegation as my previous colleague said does not address the live club sector nor does it specify the role of live entertainment as a cultural enterprise Yet despite our common sense amending action the opposition was excluded and remained unheard Colleagues we will abstain critically for the reasons I have explained but we will never be against those who make culture music

#SaponaraMaria,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government I would like to say first of all that it is a pleasure to finally speak without a mask I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Senator Tatjana Rojc and Senator Andrea Cangini the Presidents of the two Contact Committees 1a and 7a respectively Senator Dario Parrini and Senator Riccardo Nencini as well as of course all the officials of the legislative offices of both the parliamentary groups and the committees involved Mr President I wanted to thank all my fellow Senators of Commissions 1a and 7a for saying that the work on this decree law was largely and responsibly followed by all the political forces of the parliamentary majority with the only common objective of concluding it within the necessary time in order to avoid its decadence despite having very close times there was therefore this danger with the risk of not respecting the deadline of 30 June linked to the PNRR for the provision of a tranche of funds allocated to our country in the context of the Next generation EU equal to 24 billion In addition to this premise it must be remembered and fixed in the minds of everyone who has been allocated around 190 billion euros in the framework of the PNRR to Italy between loans and grants that are not provided in a single solution but in successive instalments and subordinate to compliance with a strict roadmap which provides for every intervention contained in the PNRR the respect of some deadlines that translate in short into a series of new regulations and reforms that ask us Europe If we want to say that in other words Europe lends us money more simply but we must do as Europe tells us and according to its guidelines Having said that the subject of the Decree Law which contains urgent measures for the implementation of the PNRR is clear In all there are 50 articles covering all sectors with a substantial part relating to the reform of the school which by common agreement between all the majority forces has decided to examine in an unusual way the political affiliations putting aside the shared objectives to be achieved in order to remedy the distortions which already in informal meetings prior to the approval of the measure in the Council of Ministers such as 7a The Commission had made it abundantly clear however that the matter was dealt with in a separate decree law When we did not listen we took into account the situation convinced first of all that the reform of the school contained in Articles 44 45 46 and 47 of the decree law in question could not be based on the denatality providing for the cutting of 10,000 teachers but rather should be based on the words spoken by the President of the Council on the occasion of his installation when he said that it is necessary to invest in the training of the teaching staff in order to align the educational supply to the demand of the new generations We add that this applies to all categories of teachers putting fresh resources and not as required by the decree law going to find the resources for the payment of the tutors of the internship and the training in entry subtracting them from the teaching card but with specific funding of the state budget There is no question of covering the costs of financing the training incentive fund through rationalization which means reducing the legal staff starting from the school year in 2026 2027 with particular reference to the annual quota of the staff posts for upgrading based on the fact that if there is a denatality there will be a need for a smaller number of teachers A distorted way in our opinion to understand a reform that on the contrary should give all teachers who have been working in the school for years the same opportunities to form and enable themselves without being deprived of the instrument that allows their training i.e. the teacher card On this the parliamentary majority was unshakable and in the numerous meetings not least that of yesterday morning we continued to affirm the need to correct what the Government provided for in the decree until the clash with the Government itself The government for its part has been solid in affirming that Europe wants reform in this way and that it cannot be done otherwise until we feel even that we bear the responsibility of a shortage in the coffers of the state if we had made the decree lapse resulting in no disbursement of the planned tranche of 24 billion We have come to the end only for a few hours and after countless meetings and negotiations with the Government to a compromise succeeding first of all to avoid the cut of 10,000 places of reinforcement to insert fresh resources for training to not cut the teacher card with the assurance that it will be guaranteed in a structural way by the budget law Improvement agreements to the government text which were approved in the Commission also include access for the first three cycles of the initial training course of those who are in service in the school state or equal within the limits of the reserve of the places indicated the remission to national bargaining of the incentive the return to the beehive of the negotiation of the definition of the number of additional hours access to specialization on support for those who have already carried out three years of activity It is regrettable that thousands of precarious people have been unable to secure a certain future that they have assured the survival of the school system for years and that they have not been able to qualify for the lack of training courses for nine years This is why enabling pathways should have been provided for all categories of teachers Moreover it was necessary to provide for a longer transitional phase in order to absorb the historical precariousness since in 2024 certainly it will not be done in time and moreover to the precarious ones a pre-elective test will have to be administered Finally it would have been useful also to reopen the merit rankings of the eligible in the competitions In summary we have had results but with great difficulty I would also like to point out that beyond the so called school package on which we have all agreed and which mainly committed the 7th Commission with regard to the rest of the article I have unfortunately seen reluctantly a disparity in the treatment of the amendments proposed according to the various political groups It is not difficult to verify from a table that we have taken the trouble to compile as while some political groups have accepted amendments even considerably burdensome for others it has not been so For example ours which had few amendments accepted and also not burdensome I 'd like the government to explain this to us In conclusion Mr President for our part that is by the parliamentary majority there has been a great deal of responsibility demonstrated precisely by the fact that we have been able to abandon our flagship proposals in order to achieve the objectives In this majority the League continues to play its part responsibly and purposefully and is demonstrating this widely In view of this Mr President I would like the Government to be equally responsible and ready to accept and defend the demands of Italian citizens in the face of Europe I would like the government not to bow passively to the demands of a Europe which looks coldly and detachedly at the Italian people concerned only with systematically planning society Italy with its citizens deserves detailed attention

#RomeoMassimiliano,Mr President I have anticipated the intervention in such a way as to try to be clear because the aim of the intervention of the League is above all to make clarity Meanwhile we start from the reason that led President Draghi to resign after the Movimento 5 Stars de facto decided not to vote for the trust on an important measure such as the decree law aid of 14 July last It is clear that it is easy to give responsibility only to the 5 Stars who from a political point of view have highlighted the lack of a vote of confidence however if we want to be serious we cannot think that the PD had nothing to do with all this since the thermovaluer was wanted by Mayor Gualtieri and that the Democratic Party was not able to eliminate the wide field that it wanted to create Moreover if we want to say it all since they then try to accuse us of the center right surely the split of the minister Di Maio has favored the fact that Conte could distance himself from the government therefore even those who managed the direction of that operation has a political responsibility relative to the situation in which our country is located at this moment I have heard so much talk about responsibility but we also highlight the political irresponsibility of certain majority members of the Government of National Unity The other important point to clarify because it is right that Italians know President Draghi is to understand if the goal is to save the country she is very authoritative and has all the esteem of the League Group or if the primary interest becomes to save the wide progressive field that as we have seen ended up with some error I use a joke made by Mr Mastella he ended up in the incinerator in Rome We have to understand what the truth is because if the objective is to support the broad progressive field in the end this means showing up in this Chamber essentially pretending that nothing has happened with the same team of Ministers except for a few minor adjustments and a blank delegation take or leave We in this case would have some problems some concerns also because after all that has happened it would not be serious towards the Italians and not even our voters because unlike many others we have to account to our voters to our base and to our citizens If the goal is to save the country and I am convinced as we have known it in this time we see a couple of scenarios on the horizon The first would be to note that the 5 Star Movement is no longer part of the majority of the Government of National Unity also because there is some kind of basic incompatibility In your speech Mr President in Office you spoke about the issue of gas the difficulties we will encounter this autumn the budgetary manoeuvre Thinking about the issue of energy and gas can we face an emergency of this nature and this level with who on the other side says no to the increase in gas production stop at drills no to regasifiers It is impossible to make the country 's interest with these traveling companions So I have found that the Movimento 5 Stars is outside at this point we take note instead as my colleague Anna Maria Bernini said in the debate on the last vote of confidence the one that the 5 Stars did not vote that a new majority was born that of 14 July Taking his words as a starting point President we need to rebuild a new pact Of course Mr President we are there but it means a new majority and we need to rebuild a new government that is what we mean with goals even new even a little more ambitious since there are no more 5 Stars Mr President you have rightly pointed out that the income of citizenship must be improved We use a word a little more incisive that goes in the interests of the Italians it must be thoroughly revised which does not mean not helping the needy or those who will have difficulty in accessing the world of work of this we are absolutely aware someone in the old governments had called it income of inclusion is fine but if you realize that a measure designed to stimulate the job in reality discourages it in many cases we must also have the courage to say that we want to change it that we want to reform it Mr President I am absolutely in favour of competition we are clear but I always say that good competition must also be balanced with the protection of jobs in our country in line with national interests and not the interests of multinationals But that 's not all On the subject of immigration I have heard your statements recently you rightly pointed out that we are the most welcoming country in the world we can tell us we have done so much we have given examples of solidarity we have incessant numbers of arrivals Then at some point you also said that we have reached the limit Mr President if you say that we have reached the limit you will have to have a discontinuity on the immigration policies that your Government has so far pursued These are basically the themes Among other things Mr President it is useless for us to hide it but the present Parliament will arrive at the elections on which we understand it and understand it President substantially out of control Imagine nothing changes we arrive in September we start another pull and drop how do we do the national interest In the end a government should at least have the political strength to ensure that Parliament can fully support it That is why we need a new government with you in charge Mr President because we value it and because you are authoritative Because the Italians said he has to stay where he is The alternative the second possible scenario if the conditions of stability and strength I have just described were not to be verified would be the one that some analysts have highlighted these days there are people far more experienced than me there are precedents at the time of the Ciampi Government that the President of the Republic if she resigns can always dissolve the Chambers rejecting her resignation she would remain in office until the new Government with full powers which can of course be attributed to her without any problem and complete the reforms for the PNRR that serve the country make immediately a budget law that secures the national accounts and at that point finally give the word to the Italians who have been waiting for so long As you can see there is more than one way out of this crisis but of course there must be a great force of discontinuity that only its authority can give At this point Mr President it is up to you,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#BriziarelliLuca,Mr President it is useless to point out it would be LaPalissian how special and exceptional the moment is extending an emergency state is something that has no equal we have said it several times on this issue in Republican history The characteristics of a state of emergency are certainly gravity and exceptionality if exceptionality becomes ordinary administration then we are facing something else since we have dramatically compressed personal freedoms and have upset the lives of people families and businesses We therefore need the responsibility which brings us here today to vote in favour and which led us to the Commission yesterday to present an agenda which the League strongly wanted at the first signature of my colleague Mr Augussori the agenda with which the Government is asked to review with balance reasonableness and proportionality the rules that we have imposed on Italians The data go in a precise direction thanks to the responsibility of those who have not opposed simply one we close everything to one we open everything but has struggled as the League has done for the single norm for the single category for the single initiative Every extra day every activity a little more open or less closed changes people 's lives We therefore wanted an agenda yesterday and we have tabled amendments some of them have been accepted which go in this direction because even one day it can make a difference in loosening not only simple measures but a real loop around the neck often also on the economic side of many activities Another word that needs to be added is timeliness this must be done immediately and therefore we ask not only daily to be able to review the measures but also to do so today in this House I am taking the concrete example of an amendment which was rejected yesterday in the Commission but which as a League we have chosen to re-present which concerns some of the events to which we are all more attached and which from North to South unite our country It asked at the urging of the mayors to be able to loosen the measures in the white zone to allow demonstrations such as the procession of the candles of Gubbio in my region which took place for hundreds of years even during the war the women brought the candles on Mount Ingino and even the soldiers on Col di Tenda during the war did a small procession The amendment also concerns the Palio di Siena the procession of Santa Rosalia in Palermo and all the processions of the other cities such as the festivals of the large shoulder machines declared UNESCO heritage in Sassari Palmi Nola Viterbo and other places Giving the mayors the possibility of simplified procedures for these demonstrations in the white zone means going in a direction of reopening and restarting our country The Government has given an opinion against it the amendment has been rejected and we have retabled it in this House Then I would ask the Government to reflect on it further in the time of the general discussion and to review the opinion I will ask of course with the permission of my Parent Company to vote on that amendment anyway Then I address myself as well as to the Government to change its opinion also to colleagues in Tuscany Sicily Sardinia and all the regions where events such as those outlined take place which for hundreds of years have represented our tradition giving up tradition is the first step to give up oneself and its history to vote in favour of this amendment anyway If we say here in words that the constraints and procedures must be limited and reduced we must also do so in everyday life Some might say that it may not be extended next time but let 's start today What do we tell the citizens of Noto about the procession in San Corrado on February 19 Do they or do n't they What will we say to the citizens of Gubbio for the Crystal Festival scheduled for May Can they start working on it or not Let 's give a signal and let 's start with our tradition and our essence If the government does not do so I hope that Parliament can claim it and do so,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,12.221453,-14.873001,39,mr president useless point

#AugussoriLuigi,Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President I will speak briefly to declare the vote on behalf of my Group because we are not for the first time faced with a somewhat surreal situation I would say even embarrassing We are called today to decide how to do some things but they have already happened With the decree law that we are called to convert we should decide how the ballot box should be inserted into the urn how many signatures it takes to submit a list to the local elections how the seats should be sanitized and I could continue indefinitely It 's all happened before This can only depress Parliament 's role even more I can tell you that we are at second reading and that now with mono cameralism in fact the second reading is a bureaucratic passage but in reality the first reading in the House has taken place at things already done after the Sunday of voting of the referendum and the first round We are even dealing with this decree law after the ballots have already taken place and this is not good I repeat it is not good it is serious because Mr President if Parliament had been involved and there was a way and time to do so since as some colleagues have pointed out before the decree law is from the first days of May and therefore there were even forty days to be able to examine and intervene we could have helped the government to avoid certain figures Let us think for example of the masks in the seats I recall briefly the question three days or four days before the vote a circular of the Ministries of Interior and Health on health protocols provided for the masks within the voting sections Attention not within the seats buildings and schools but within the sections it was sent to the presidents to check An obnoxious I assume that many of you have gone to vote sometime and we know well therefore that the assembly is out not when you enter one at a time in the voting section Those who have written this rule can therefore at least be accused of institutional ignorance The beauty is that these masks were delivered to the seats by the Government they arrived to the prefectures the prefectures sent them to the municipalities and the latter to the voting sections Well this little game cost citizens EUR 6 million Masks which at last were no longer necessary but were bought and distributed so we think not only about the living cost of matter but also about all the work that has been done Who 's paying Do you always pay Pants or pay Minister Lamorgese and Minister Hope I would like to point out another politically much more serious issue the choice to vote only on Sundays The Government indeed the Presidency of the Council in recent months has done an excellent job with a committee of experts and has produced the White Paper on abstentionism entitled For the participation of citizens How to reduce abstentionism and facilitate voting Some ways of encouraging participation and reducing abstentionism are identified by the Government President do you know what is the first and most important Vote in two days This is what the government says to reduce abstentionism it is necessary to vote on Sunday and Monday What does Minister Lamorgese do We only vote on Sundays It is not a choice dictated by other reasons by other logics I can not possibly avoid the costs of the scruters No the government knows that voting on two days reduces abstentionism and therefore the government or rather Minister Lamorgese decides to vote in one day just to facilitate abstentionism and reduce the possibility of reaching quorum in the referendum Political choice which I would not have expected from a minister who declares himself technical But now Minister Lamorgese is no surprise at a number of things Just to say one where is it There is one measure of yours in this House but the Minister is not there Although I am worthyly represented by the Undersecretary whom I thank for the cooperation presence and help he has given us in the Commission I would have expected to see the Minister here and not to see him only when President Draghi is here for sitting by his side for the photos I would have expected Minister Lamorgese to hear from his voice some explanation of what happened in Palermo directly or indirectly it is the responsibility of the Minister of the Interior if the electoral machine does not work and in Palermo it did not work He must also explain why unlike what other colleagues from other countries might have done he chose not to resign for what happened Anyway nothing surprises us anymore Mr Lamorgese does little if nothing is as firm motionless and static as a traffic light at a crossroads green light for the illegals red light for all about democracy In conclusion Mr President we are voting in favour of this confidence only because of institutional duty and on the substance of the matter so that the effects of the decree law do not lapse,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#AugussoriLuigi,"Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President the approach of the measure to the House shows that Parliament is increasingly paying attention to the small municipalities or to say the least to the vast majority of them the fantastic panorama of 8,000 bell towers whose typicality cannot be confused and distorted by the need for a handful of metropolis We come to the House thanks to an effort by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which has been able to deal with the measure very quickly since it received from the House the bill Pella combining it here with the bill of the League for a long time on the agenda of our Commission I cannot fail to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on all of them Mr Parrini and the Brothers of Italy Group who following an agreement made themselves available to withdraw their amendments We could say that this is a small reform which allows the third consecutive mandate only to the mayors of the municipalities from 3,000 to 5,000 inhabitants like the lower belt but it is very significant of the trend we are running It is confirmed that it is more effective to proceed for punctual interventions some even mini rather than waiting in vain for the birth of a general maxi-reform that might never see the light at least in this legislature We owe it to the mayors first of all because being mayor is getting harder and harder Those of us who have not been in this position recently find it hard to understand that it is probably even more challenging than being a Member of Parliament Only in recent months have the mayors in addition to all that they already did had to face the enormous responsibilities for the management of the pandemic the numerous PNRR calls to be prepared with few employees and municipal secretaries missing and the disproportionate increase of the energy costs and raw materials necessary for ordinary maintenance extraordinary and new investments to the point that it often becomes impossible to close the forecast budgets except for an increase in local taxes which is highly hateful at a time when citizens already suffer increases in bills and problems of work as a result of lockdown Finally even more recently they face the reception of refugees from Ukraine Today however this is an intervention not only in favour of the mayors but mainly aimed at the electoral citizens who will have the opportunity if they wish to be represented by someone with experience and skills matured in ten years who will not be so dispersed Today 's is joined by other interventions in the field Firstly the allowances increased and updated although it is necessary to remember that the Government with the intervention in the budget law penalized the small ones with respect to the draft parliamentary law We must absolutely commit ourselves to correcting what has been done and we must also update the section on work permits Secondly the civil and criminal liability of the mayors I always take the example of the mayor who is at trial for murder for a rock fallen from a mountain path The measure is proceeding not very quickly in the Joint Committees on Constitutional Affairs and Justice We have to give it back and finish before the summer The subject is very sensitive and cannot be addressed in the somewhat clumsy way that is present in the hypothesis of reform of the TUEL proposed by the prefects of the Ministry led by Minister Lamorgese The issue cannot be resolved by a horizontal transfer to the administrative structure also shifting risk with responsibility If there is no motivation and above all the one that can have the chosen one is missing then paralysis is at risk I remember that the medium small municipalities have problems of shortage and quality of staff the employees are missing because in the years when there was money to hire the state has blocked the hiring and now that you can hire there is no more money because either you pay the increases or you pay the bills The assumption of responsibility on the part of the managers is feasible only where the managers are there Who have you ever seen the executives in the small municipalities Then there is the whole issue of the provincial bodies following the failed reform of the Delrio law and there is the whole game of the missing municipal secretaries whose deficiency paralyzes the administrative activity It goes on with the bits with the deputy secretaries with the secretaries to climb over with the secretaries shared among 10 municipalities you can't work in this way it 's not civilized country The solution cannot even be that of the associated managements You all know of the criticism of the ANCI to which was added yesterday the rejection of the National Association of Small Municipalities of Italy ANPCI Now the mayors after managing a pandemic must manage the arrival of the refugees do magic with the budget in order to be able to pay everything without knowing what will happen if the war does not end and the principle of guilt is still valid to them Without respecting the judgment of the Constitutional Court the reform says in practice that a mayor of a small municipality must prove that he is not an incompetent person and that he is able to provide adequate services to citizens on the basis of which criteria it is not known or is obliged to associate It is madness the result of a centralist and borbonic vision When Covid was there and the mayors were on the front line alone no one wondered if they were able alone and with the employees unfortunately at home to help their people On the other hand we must give confidence to local administrators and therefore we must take steps like this and believe me that there are very few mayors in the second term now who are swaying to do the third under these conditions In conclusion the Lega Group will vote strongly in favour of this draft law because we are going in the right direction but there is still a long way to go Certainly when there are still vital issues for local authorities the League will be at the forefront and ready also to play a role of pungolo to give the right gratitude to those people who give up their professional and personal life to make themselves available to their community To the mayors of any political color we say that the League is and will always be at their side 18.18 p.m.",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,10.396488,-14.306224,39,"mr agussori l sp psd az mr president approach measure house shows parliament increasingly paying

#ZaffiniFrancesco,Mr President we are responsible for ensuring a minimum of decency for the debate that follows these measures which come from the government in a difficult way to dedicate For the umpteenth time we come to examine in this House a very important measure which affects the daily life of Italians in a strict way and which affects not only their attitudes but also their daily life and even their eating And then we 'll clarify why I 'm saying this We will get there again without the rapporteur and we will see what will happen with regard to the possibility of discussing the amendments in this House This morning in the Commission of course because of the overlapping of timetables and timetables it was not possible to deal with the amendments nor did we end the examination of Article 1 All this in short is really becoming a reckless practice and I must say that fortunately there is the Brothers of Italy Group that as this morning and as on other occasions I would like to say as always since the Government has installed itself guarantees Parliament at least a minimum of decorum We are also doing so under these conditions knowing that we are speaking for the benefit of the shorthand report We do so regardless of any other consideration because obviously we have clear what our role and responsibility are and we respond as always to the Italians There are as I said many passages and a thousand inconsistencies in this provision Many passages by the way are anachronistic In fact we are converting and confirming outdated deadlines in this measure there are 28 February deadlines that we are converting today on 2 March and we are doing so obviously for the benefit of what has happened In a normal condition a normal government should instead have changed these measures and made them compatible with the conversion of the Assembly which has always been done and which clearly no longer finds room in the attitudes and postures to use a term that I heard yesterday of this government posing as ras There are four points I intend to deal with in particular because it would take an hour to deal with everything contained in the measure Among these four the most important in my opinion is the recognition of the food part of the salary We have also talked about this in the Commission because at least we have been able to exchange ideas on this We are failing to recognize the unbearable food component of the salary of those who are suspended from work because they have not been vaccinated while to give an example this food part of the salary is recognized to the mobsters the murderers or all those who civil servants are suspended from the service waiting for the process that sees them accused for serious crimes even hateful But those who are suspended from work and salary because they have not been vaccinated are not given the feeding portion of the salary That 's the way it is President It 's not recognized There are people who do n't get to be able to guarantee their family food spending I think I see the disbelief in the eyes of my fellow Members who listen few in fact but I assure you that this happens there are also amendments from the political side of the President who have tried to make it clear to the Government that this can not be continued There is another subject which is also paradoxical we are going as far as possible as we said yesterday and repeated it to welcome the refugees of this wretched war within Europe and at the gates of national borders Well many of these subjects are vaccinated with Sputnik did you make this trivial consideration Do you realize that this is a vaccine that has the same technology and the same results of effect and validity as the vaccines that we have inoculated in Italy such as Pfizer and Moderna i.e. mRNA vaccines And yet we do n't recognize who received the Sputnik vaccine as covering the green pass So what are we gonna do with these people Do we revenge them again or leave them without green passes with everything that 's involved What will happen to these people who come from that territory of war and oppression I have another subject for the benefit of the House and there are amendments dealing with these matters We launched the Novavax vaccine a protein vaccine presented as the green vaccine the vaccine of all those who had not vaccinated so far because they did not trust or rely on what we had told them about the validity of vaccines until now used Well the Novavax vaccine is a failure in the sense that all regions have made it available but there is no access to this vaccine and it is now widely registered It is therefore true ladies and gentlemen that what has to be done from the outset we are still not doing so today we still think that we want to force people to vaccinate rather than convince them And how is it possible to convince people to vaccinate Mr Sileri It is possible through doctors of general medicine Recently we held a hearing in the Commission with the trade union representatives of family doctors who said that no region has made available to doctors the records of their caregivers who are not covered by the vaccine there was no feedback there was no collaboration there was no involvement of the main figure to which the citizen has to rely To whom should the citizen be entrusted The Gruber and the 8 and a half To whom should the citizen be entrusted but to his family doctor Well family doctors have always been constantly also in this circumstance related to the Novax vaccine excluded from any operation of conviction and involvement of citizens still not vaccinated Mr President it has been nine minutes and twenty five seconds PRESIDENT The debate is closed You 've got ten minutes and I 'm warning you 35 seconds away Do n't you trust the bell Mr Zaffini FdI I still have 40 seconds Finally I would like to conclude Mr President I do not think there will be any particular traffic in this morning 's speeches PRESIDENT The debate is closed I 'll give you another minute Come to the conclusion Mr Zaffini FdI Let 's move on to the ventilation of the classrooms Even today after two years of pandemic and these particularly cold days in Rome we are venting the classrooms of the schools where we send our children through the opening of the windows If this is acceptable in a civilized and modern country I let you consider it We have adopted amendments concerning the possibility of adapting classrooms with forced mechanical ventilation in school environments but these measures are not reflected in the circulars and regulations that the government must implement it must do so today immediately not in three or six months time But all this is not there and on the other hand brought to

#ZaffiniFrancesco,"Mr President the work of the opposition with this Government is very easy to do It would suffice to comment on the measure in question with two paradigms with two methods of judgment one is that this is the forty fourth vote of confidence to which the present Government forces Parliament I can speak with reasonable constriction Mr President Beyond the point we all know of the appeal of the President of the Republic who has redone his predecessor with respect to the repeated and excessive use of confidence voting there is another aspect I am speaking to you exactly Mr President as a pro-tempore representative of that group to say that the other aspect is the most total disinterest in dealing with the measure by colleagues It is obvious and natural that after 44 votes of confidence the MEP should stop appealing to the sense of responsibility to the desire to work and to apply to the study and preparation of measures to the support of the debate first in the Commission and then in this House It stops doing its job and this is for everyone of course particularly those who are Members of Parliament to safeguard the role and decency of the institutions The second subject would suffice only to mention it my colleagues Mr Calandrini and Mr De Bertoldi were very clear but so were those of the other groups who like Senator Toffanin spoke on the affair of the 110 superbonus which is commented on by themselves You do damage and are cursedly harmful in the context of the current social political and economic situation of the country as you like to call it but I call it Italy Nation It is really difficult to pinpoint the kind of attitude of a government that intervening on a measure penalizes a sector that had shown timid signs of recovery On all the bonus measures that were to be hit the one on 110 was the last to be dealt with indeed the only one not to be dealt with because if there are evasion scam and deception this happens on other bonuses which instead leave unchanged You guys play a little spill I wonder if the representative of the government knows the game of the reverse a variant of the tressette You 're gonna play trash Take measures that are contrary to normal common sense In the face of a debate that has already been conditioned and heavily cut by the vote of confidence and the mistrust of colleagues in relation to what is happening in this House the representative of the Government does not even take note because his presence here is useless He 's here for duty of presence for a duty related to the shorthand report and I speak for the same duty This government compared to what suggests the least parliamentary debate that survives and I stress the adjective understands little late and badly It would be better if he did not understand at all what we suggest to him in the various measures with amendments observations and agendas according to the normal activity of a democracy with the institutions that work He understands late and badly he realizes the existence of the problem certifies it to us in the measures and then adopts a solution or better thinks to give us one which is just light years away from being such It 's worse It 's like when at school interviews teachers said to my mother it 's nothing but it 's worse because she would also be able to do That 's the theme You are worse than the schoolboy who unfortunately does n't do anything but would be smart and also capable of doing Let me give an example by referring to the resources provided to the Regions for the Covid with a measure that you define as final as to say I give you these four points and do not ask me anymore You pay an additional 400 million on a title for which only Umbria my Region which with its 900,000 inhabitants has a relative weight must take 110 million but attention already reduced and discounted It is not that because of Covid in addition to the regional health fund he has spent 110 he has spent many more about 300 million more and has to recover 110 You put 400 for all the Italian regions The Emilia Romagna of my colleague Errani who looks at me must take 700 Then I wonder representative of the Ministry of Economics and Finance but who has to put this money there Who Who 's gonna put this money in there It is money spent by the Regions not promised it is spent already reported If you 're smarter you 're smarter but you have to check you 're a member of this Those who are smarter who are less clever are still money reported How do you say you put 400 million on a permanent basis How final Then the regions go into disarray They have to go into disarray You are announcing that all the regions of Italy will be in disarray We are talking in fact about the definitive title and not that as for all the other things that you come to tell us you will put back our hands with the next provision as you have always done It is not that we were told not to worry because we are aware of the problem which will be discussed at the next step No President this time it is written definitively There 's no cat tripe left Where does this arrogance in institutional relations come from Where is the sound and correct cooperation between the institutions and the institutions Where is he And why are you so sure that you can speak in this wretched country permanently There 's nothing here definitive There is only your inability and your inconsistency without any extenuating Mr President I would like to speak for another half an hour because I have taken so many notes on a measure which you of the hypertrophic majority consider insignificant I only set the example of the Regions Recognize that you must compensate for the adverse events from vaccines for those who are vaccinated out of the obligation which assuming a health treatment is therefore already compensated for perhaps So put money to compensate for adverse events from vaccines Well do you know how much you give for the adverse event against the family members of a deceased Although the total numbers are all to be seen remember that in Italy we recorded over 150,000 deaths Do you know how much you give with the measure to our examination to the relatives of a deceased one off 77,000 euros Shame shame shame As far as the family of professionals is concerned I can only endorse what Mrs Cantù said We are still dragging the fact that we recognize fair compensation to the relatives of health care workers who have died because of the State who did not provide personal protective equipment DPI forcing them to work under massacred conditions let 's say because of the epidemic if we want the general attenuating We are still fighting over the compensations of the deceased health workers due to the first and second wave of the Covid If I said shame three times before I should say it five this time but I do n't I save time You have decided to finance the student masks without making it clear that it is the State that has to provide them You funded them I recall that an agenda of Brothers of Italy has passed Everything that is in fact written in the provision at our examination President had been dealt with by Brothers of Italy 's amendments to the budget law and to the various previous measures Copy and evil because you are not capable The FFP2 masks must provide them it is not enough to allocate the money and look at the need for masks for children aged five to sixteen because normal FFP2s are not good for their faces we have dealt with this issue in the Commission and in the Chamber and we have approved an agenda of Brothers of Italy with a favourable opinion of the Government but we do not see the way and we do not understand what must happen I shall close my speech Mr President and I thank you for your time with an amendment which has been adopted After a full intervention of complaints and crampons it is also right that it closes with a movement of hope at least one which derives from an amendment approved proposed by the undersigned and by Brothers of Italy which provides a certain amount at the start for families and subjects forced to use technical medical sanitary equipment the so called devices which absorb energy and therefore have great costs in the household bill Well this amendment has been adopted and we are largely satisfied with it So I want to end with a message of hope and trust but that to be fair is even worse because it means that sometimes when you understand the serious proposals you also know how to deal with them Then always do so because through parliamentary activity the normal one not this the measures can only be improved and Italy can only go better if the institutions work",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#ZaffiniFrancesco,Mr Zaffini FdI Mr President I am actually announcing the vote of abstention by Brothers of Italy It is not so much a recognition of the substance of the method of the work done by the rapporteurs by Mr La Pietra and of the work done in the Commission This should be the rule it should be what we always do the measure comes from the government as always it makes water from all sides because this is a government of people too different that they do not agree even if they take coffee or decaf so there are measures bag- of bone as we would say in journalistic jargon and Parliament with its amending activity does its job that is improves the text and comes out a better measure That would be the rule but as we unfortunately know it has been quite straightforward with repeated votes in which the question of trust has been raised In fact I would like to point out that there are very rare acts on which you can work Compared to this and also in part to the contents that have emerged the decision of the Brothers of Italy Group is to abstain on this measure It is clear that in relation to this we cannot fail to highlight the enormous shortcomings of this measure first of all the data of resources In politics weighing the importance of a measure takes place by assessing the resources that are allocated to it In this regard the resources that the amending activity has managed to increase added to the resources provided by the Government are really minimal and they allow easy to understand the degree of attention of the Government to the problem that as has been observed by all is enormous and weighs on the domestic product that from some parts has been evaluated between direct and indirect i.e. extended product near the three points of GDP This is an absolutely serious thing because if the quality leap of this virus were to happen and pass to the domestic pig I remember and it has already been said that it is a very dangerous virus because it survives in the carcasses and does not have a vaccine for us it would really be a very serious debâcle The second limit of the measure that comes out of this branch of Parliament is the time factor We all know that the time factor is obvious compared to immediate measures to combat the spread I do not say eradication which will be more difficult and is beyond to come Compared to the detection of the presence of the virus in the first carcass months have passed and this is very serious Mr La Pietra said this the problem does not concern the working time I say to the rapporteur of the measure in Parliament those were appropriate useful and I repeat we are appreciating the method and the work done The problem is the time when we reacted the reaction times of the government of the country system to a problem that was widely expected The swine fever is endemic in Sardinia even if of different strain but above all it was announced so much so that as my colleague La Pietra recalled already almost a year ago had been proposed a deal assigned to the Commission that if it had found space and attention it would probably give the country system the opportunity to adapt and prepare for the emergency that was coming and that has arrived today 15.10 p.m. ZAFFINI follow The third consideration which is perplexed and also sufficiently disconcerted concerns the method of downloading the Regions It is not possible as happened with the Covid and in many other precedents that whenever this multicolored government rainbow so you are happy harlequin can not find a synthesis even on absolutely important and serious subjects there is always the escape way to say that the Regions will think about it in the sense that they will do what they want and believe It is a complete discharge and it is serious because beyond the thousand considerations of merit that we could make the immediate result that can be achieved and that will certainly be achieved is a diversity of regulations and disorientational plans with respect to the emergency and conditions for example of the venatory withdrawal There will be a migration of the venatory exercise because there will be regions that will allow to do some things and others of different orientation or of different weighing of certain ideological positions it is easy to define them which instead will not allow to do things even absolutely normal Therefore beyond the ugliness of this posture which sees the Government each time discharge on the Regions the responsibility to take difficult and probably sometimes even unpopular measures there is a serious problem of coordination that this text is not that it does not solve it does not even address Who will coordinate the plans of the Regions Not the Commissioner because it is specifically planned that the Commissioner should do only what concerns the emergency in the red areas In view of the emergency he will also do so outside the red zone as Mr Bruzzone tells me and I take it as a good thing having studied the measure better than I do can the Commissioner deal with all this Is it likely that the Commissioner will coordinate the regions for example on the activity of the hunting levy I do n't believe it That 's never gonna happen Who will do it then Will ISPRA Higher Institute for Environmental Protection and Research do this God damn it Who does that Someone can do this for example within the framework of the State Regions Conference but this figure must be identified because it is not possible that I repeat those who reside in a region bordering another Region find themselves having to deal with completely different measures norms and regulations there will be a general disorientation at the expense of precisely the ability to attack the problem and to face the emergency that I remember is serious very serious very heavy God forbid the leap of quality should happen With regard to all this Brothers of Italy will abstain from voting We have helped in the Commission as far as possible to improve the measure We would have liked to have done so to a greater extent if we had found a minimum of shore because the ideas we have presented have also been shared in a separate forum even if then in the logic of government activity all this has been sacrificed to the logic of majority It is clear Mr President that with regard to the need to create this coordination we will be following up with the instruments of direction in the hope that at least this will be brought to an end So let us welcome this method Mr President It does not seem to me that we have lost all this time it does not seem to me that we have sacrificed the times of conversion of the decree it does not seem to me that we have done anything serious If we were able to do the same thing all the time probably even the attitude of the Brothers of Italy Group in the Chamber could be a bit different from the dynamics and dialectic that we

#ZulianiCristiano,Mr President Minister ladies and gentlemen I am partially satisfied The Minister has explained to us that a legislative intervention would be needed to legislate in this respect and to guarantee an allocation on the part to 40 60 percent We believe it is necessary to continue with this legislative intervention because given the hand of ANCI Lombardia not of the League it is clear that beyond the municipalities that are financed and of which the Minister has spoken we would not respect the 40 South and 60 North part but not because we have something against the territories of the South because that is not the case but because for example even at a recent hearing of Minister Bianchi Senator Candiani who is a signatory to the question rightly said that there is a risk of creating social tensions that are absolutely unnecessary at this time We remember in fact that while for Molise are given 6 euros per capita per inhabitant in the Lombardy Region 4 thousandths per inhabitant 6 thousandths in Veneto and 12 in Emilia Romagna and Piedmont We call on the Government to commit itself to an automatism that will ensure that this part is respected,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,10.618471,-14.704524,39,mr president minister ladies gentlemen partially satisfied minister explained us legislative intervention would needed legislate respect guarantee allocation part 40 60 percent believe necessary continue legislative intervention given hand anci lombardia league clear beyond municipalities financed minister spoken would respect 40 south 60 north part something territories south case example even recent hearing minister bianchi senator candiani signatory question rightly said risk creating social tensions absolutely unnecessary time remember fact molise given 6 euros per capita per inhabitant lombardy region 4 thousandths per inhabitant 6 thousandths veneto 12 emilia romagna piedmont call government commit automatism ensure part respected
#DeCarloLuca,"Mr President I should like to begin with a point of order It would appear that this time the government is not oriented to raise the question of trust That would already be a huge step forward In fact let us remind everyone that you have arrived you have arrived to the fiftieth trust We also remind those who may have noticed the times in the other legislatures or in the other governments that preceded this complained about the use of trust It means that 50 times you have expropriated Parliament from its role and so today that seems not to be the case let us record first good news I wonder if we will be able after so much lack of training to discuss the amendments In fact Brothers of Italy did not withdraw the 50 amendments and indeed will try to improve the measure in our examination precisely because it will finally be possible to discuss it in this House In reality however a part of trust in our view you have already asked for it It is an extra parliamentary trust not that extra-parliamentary one that much likes part of the hemicycle but an extra- parliamentary trust that your leader the highly authoritative Mario Draghi has asked a Council of Ministers which lasted eight minutes Eight minutes in which evidently long winded he told you or so or I go home terrorizing Ministers and party leaders with the possibility of possible elections which is terrible because competition exists and must be sought everywhere except electoral competition Europe does not ask for it and we do not need it we do not need it we do not need it today we need stability Today in your opinion we need stability In eight minutes then the Premier used his authority That authoritativeness which we would like him to use in Europe on foreign policy issues which he would use in Europe to explain that the Bolkestein directive has nothing to do with this measure We would still like you to explain that the PNRR funds are not being called into question if the issue of bathing areas is not being applied which has nothing to do with them We would like you to explain to Europe that this PNRR does not work because the conditions on which it was born have changed and that today a PNRR of war is needed to address the issues that have become more acute at the time when one nation Russia has invaded another sovereign nation Ukraine That authoritativeness which becomes authority spends it in saying quoting an old advertisement O so Either Pomì that is either do so or go home All those who until then had tabled penguins of amendments withdrew them because this agreement was found yet another agreement to the bottom on the skin of the beaches We are talking about 30,000 companies which are virtually broken because Europe is paying us for this operation as we heard earlier in this House It is no wonder that the Europe of finance is paying for a sale of goods that are not scarce as the reports report the beaches are not a bad thing so there is not even that premise to put them into competition Nor is it surprising that Europe is saying that it is selling and that it is paying us to sell goods to multinationals because that is something we have been seeing for several years For many years we have heard that Europe has been asking for this but I thought that that era was over Instead Europe the Europe of multinationals and not the Europe of nations and peoples is calling for that era back We do not give in to this economic fatalism because we too believe that inflation and inequality are a problem Of course inflation has seen prices rise above all in the energy and agricultural sectors perhaps because programming has not been planned Will anyone take the blame for not having made the programming or is it the fault of the adverse fate I believe that it is not the fault of adverse fate but of those who have ruled this nation in these years and in the previous ones so it is better for someone to have an examination of conscience before doing it to others The same discourse is about inequalities so much so that excessive liberalism has led to an increase in inequalities not to greater equality on the contrary I invite you to go and look at studies even on the Internet in the absence of other sources Inequalities grow when the State does not also deal with the market liberalism has failed and excessive liberalism continues to prevail in this House even on the part of those who should absolutely oppose it I consider this measure to be a bad one and that is why we have tried to improve it You think that in the Commission we have also tried to make our own the amendments proposed by other political forces knowing that many times the government has rejected them and then proposed them again perhaps in a subsequent measure because it obviously felt them to be of common sense We were hoping that he would do the same thing but nothing happened In the Commission the signatories themselves rejected their amendments and I believe that this is the plastic demonstration of how the general interest was not pursued but the purely personal one",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#GarneroSantancheDaniela,"GARNERO SANTANCHE FdI Mr President ladies and gentlemen we are truly based on what happened on this decree This is a question of method As you all know it expires on 30 April Therefore we did not understand why the measure came from the House yesterday at lunchtime and this Government today decided to put trust in the Commission yesterday we had a great battle the Undersecretary was also present asking if there was any element of urgency that escaped us In fact we could not understand why having still time we were not given the opportunity to do the work for which we are paid to go to the Commission to table amendments and comments and to vote on them Mr President we have not been given an answer to this We are here today with yet another vote of confidence on a decree so full bodied made up of 43 articles which is the first measure on a topic as direct as that of the energy problem We are here to say nothing to take this decree law in a closed box and to vote for trust not us but the majority will We have heard so many speeches from those who are in the government today and are a majority that we could not trample on Parliament 's priorities that we had to recognize Parliament 's dignity and allow it to exercise its role then we see that when certain people are sitting on the seats of the government they change their minds and the fact of trampling Parliament is no longer straight opening the Palace as cans of tuna is no longer straight You 've lost whatever I think but it 's okay Madame Marquise keep it up Coming to the merits this decree law was sold to us as if it could solve all the energy problems of our nation above all we were told that it had been done to protect families and businesses We on the other hand absolutely do not see the strong signs of troubleshooting Then there is another issue that worries us no one takes into account the inflation that is galloping in our nation which today tell us to be equal to 6.7 percent What is the reason for this inflation I believe that we have all understood this it is due to a greater extent to the high fuel the high energy and the increase in the cost of raw materials Perhaps only the government of the best does not realize a topic that will actually lead and I do not want to be a Cassandra to the collapse of our productive system But alas we have also had this great disappointment from the Government especially because we see that in this decree law the bureaucracy increases so it will be even more difficult for the enterprises and there is no sign of what would be fundamental and called a term much abused by the majority but not applied simplification This measure shows that the sirens of no and radical chic environmentalists are increasingly being heard Today we do not have a vision of energy supplies and what should reduce our dependence which I remember has not diminished in the last five years but has increased because the gentlemen do not sit today in the government and alas have a fundamental influence on everything that is decided Today someone should take a conscience test and think that if our nation is in this situation it owes it to those who only knew how to say no No it has been said for example to the new generation of nuclear power which would allow the disposal of waste and then however to buy nuclear power from our neighbouring countries it has been said no to the regasifiers which absolutely could not be done it has been said no to the extraction of gas in our home and then to go and buy it in other countries No has been said about regasifiers and today the government is working to buy floating ones spending a lot of money and encountering serious problems to find them because they are not so easy to find I remember the election campaign of Mayor Gualtieri when he swore to all his voters that he would never make the thermo-energy plant in Rome Today 's news is that Mayor Gualtieri has announced the arrival of a thermo-energy plant in Rome I do not know whether it is right to act in this way to show up in an electoral campaign in a certain way to take a few extra votes and then a few months later to deny it These things should n't happen Let me give you another example the Lombardy Region has made available 12 million euros in order to be able to change the boilers to polluting biomass because we know that they pollute with a technology classified with a name that sounds a bit mocking 5 stars and that will allow not to pollute The Lombardy Region has made this sum available and do you know what happened This funding may go to 1,505 of the 1,506 municipalities of the Lombardy Region but heard not to the City of Milan because the Mayor Sala prohibited the application of this technology It 's called Sala and it belongs to your majority What should we say that we are part of an opposition force patriotic that we would have wanted to make a contribution to this which is the first decree that is issued after 24 February and after the invasion of Ukraine You think you are better you know how to do everything but you have forgotten in this decree the interest of the production system of our nation because there is practically no measure to support companies Yesterday you freed 10 billion of resources by believing that you are making an epochal intervention but you will have seen that Germany in order to contain the increase in prices has made 100 billion available To you who fill your mouths with Europe at every opportunity but only when it is appropriate I would like to ask how you feel today that you allocate 10 billion without giving answers when Germany allocates 100 billion It would be good for you to do a truth operation with the Italians and after two and a half years of a pandemic which no one wanted for which you asked for sacrifices to the Italians tell the citizens clearly that we are facing an energy lockdown Have the courage to say that families and businesses will have to suffer an energetic lockdown due to your lack of vision Do you remember the famous Sundays with alternate plates the famous Sundays on foot The problem for our nation is not represented as President Draghi said by the choice between the air conditioner and peace but by the need to support our productive system and know that the resources that you do not spend today you will spend it tomorrow because you will have to pay the Cassa Integrazione for those companies that because of your inability will have to close and fail Congratulations For

#BagnaiAlberto,"Mr President I start from the summary of previous episodes On 31 March I replied to the question time by reminding the Minister of Health that the question of trust cannot be raised in courtrooms It is good to remember this in this speech for the reasons we shall see Meanwhile forty seven days later we are here fervently and eagerly waiting to vote yet another confidence faithful to the roadmap of this Government that has put on average the issue of trust every nine days It is a fact that objectively squeals with the extent of the parliamentary support which this Government enjoys and which determines in fact if not in its intentions a substantial abolition of the debate To understand us the theme is not so much the confidence that will be placed here in the Senate because it is somehow determined by the circumstances and by the regulatory times the decree laws must be converted within sixty days Legislative Decree No. 24 was published in the Official Gazette on March 24 and we remain seven days to convert it so a further passage to the House is not even remotely conceivable and this is peaceful The problem however is the question of trust in the House where given that adequate time has been taken for consideration Parliament 's amendments would have been expected to be taken more seriously This consideration has not been and we regret not only because it leads us to regard this decree with some regret as a missed opportunity but also because in the meantime in the courtrooms as was easy to predict the government 's system of countering the pandemic is receiving heavy censorship which would have been possible to avoid at least in some cases if more attention had been paid to parliamentary proposals in particular to some proposals of the League to which the Minister has opposed a refusal as firm as objectively in some cases incomprehensible I would like to take the example of Amendment 8,58 by Mrs Boldi who took care of the defence security and rescue personnel who are not in direct contact with the general public and patients and therefore requested that they not be suspended Well it was not intended to take into account this rational proposal and in one of the classrooms in which trust cannot be placed that of the tribunal of Padua on 28 April last the judge ordered the reinstatement without demand of an OSS failing to the vaccination obligation arguing that the vaccination obligation imposed on the workers in question does not appear suitable to achieve the purpose it aims to achieve which is to preserve the health of the guests The judge continues In fact it can be considered noteworthy that the person who has undergone the vaccination cycle can still contract the virus and infect others The safest method at present to prevent a worker from infecting the other persons present at the workplace is to have reasonable certainty that he is not infected reasonable certainty that as a visa cannot be given by vaccination but by the periodic submission of the worker to the buffer He therefore ordered the worker 's reinstatement essentially on condition that he showed a super green pass which is then that certificate of which we were told that he gave the guarantee of being among non-cultivated persons and therefore we do not understand why we must overcome it with more incisive measures when the problem is the guarantee of being among non-cultivated persons With Amendment 8.75 Mr Borghi had asked for the abolition of the application of non-vaccined teachers The proposal has not been accepted In another courtroom where the question of trust cannot be raised that of the court of Grosseto the judgment n. 203/2022 RG of 3 May 2022 has ordered the immediate reinstatement without demand of a teacher possessing enhanced green certification i.e. not necessarily reinforced by vaccination Amendment 8.60 called for the possibility for suspended staff to redeem their contributions This amendment was also rejected Not only that I learned just now from a doctor that the three months notice for dismissal cannot start during the period of suspension which means basically that a doctor who intended to quit to go and do something else should pay a heavy penalty to the health company at which he is employed Basically we want to harm the right of these people to a free and dignified existence for the rest of their days beyond the end of the emergency which in our opinion would not justify or ever justified such injury preventing them from having access at their expense to adequate pension treatment I 'm sorry to have to point this out but this thing which has gone through quite silence seems like an unheard of gravity We are engaged in a total war and extermination against those who have thought that they are making a choice under conditions of extreme uncertainty which justify hesitation I would like to remind you once again of the order of the Council of Administrative Justice for the Sicilian Region which considered that a referral to the Constitutional Court was not manifestly unfounded arguing among other things that pharmacovigilance has demonstrated during this period of serious deficiencies which were admitted by those responsible in the hearings we held There are organisational shortcomings lack of staff and governance problems all of them I repeat have been admitted It is precisely today that several associations have deposited a curian memory at the Constitutional Court to help the constitutional judge to form a judgment on various aspects including the state of pharmacovigilance I do not understand why it insists on measures that seem animated by a sterile punitive will subtly hysterical that no matter how well meaning it may be it is proving increasingly counterproductive every day also because among other things it contributes to that lack of health personnel that has become chronic during the austerity season of which only the strength in which I honour myself as a military denounced in time the drawbacks including the inevitable failure of what remains one of the best public health systems in the world If this is the case we must think that this is also and above all because of those who work there For all thanks we find nothing better to do than subject these professionals to discriminatory treatment which every day appears increasingly lacking in scientific bases as some of the judgments I have cited show in their narrative Then there is the stone banquet of the strategy of contrasting to the pandemic which is natural immunity a phenomenon under investigation and denied The healed are to put it in the words of the never too late Gigi Proietti the black knight of the pandemic 15 million people to whom it would be advisable not to break the soul since in all evidence there is no compelling scientific need to do so while there is sufficient and abundant scientific evidence suggesting that they consider them a resource as endowed with immunity substantially equivalent to the vaccine We have seen in other latitudes politics become the subject of fiction and vice versa but no matter how fertile the imagination of the writers is hardly one of them could have imagined that such an attack on labour law firmly written in the first article of our Constitution would be brought by the founder of Article One All this is bitterly beautiful but we need to put an end to it You did n't want to listen to us but you can't help but listen to the courts I say this not with pleasure but with bitterness because it seems to me very inappropriate to offer the judiciary such an opportunity to exercise an additional role of political direction by issuing clearly damaging decrees of constitutionally guaranteed rights I have referred to Articles 1 and 36 and others but I have done so again and I do not repeat myself The problem of a rebalancing of powers to be more explicit the problem of a certain exondation of the judiciary already exists However if we break the embankment of the Constitution we cause this problem and therefore we lose the right to complain about it and the credibility to intervene With great humility but with just as much determination I urge all colleagues to reflect on this point I am sure that if we maintain the pace of confidence every nine days we will not lack opportunities to correct this trajectory Let us work together not to lose these opportunities in mutual respect and for the interest of the country",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#BagnaiAlberto,"BAGNAI L SP PSd Az Mr President I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for this complex measure I would also like to thank the Government for the help it has given us by coordinating the drafting of the majority resolution in full respect of Parliament 's voice Finally I would like to thank my colleagues in the majority for the sensitivity with which they have been able to cooperate in finding a fall point that respects the physiognomy of the individual groups the role of Parliament 's direction and also the inexorable logic of the data that as many have pointed out shows us a rapidly evolving reality not unexpected but unfortunately not favourable In principle if not all much divides us in this majority from the most remote history which sees us children of ideological matrixes often very distant to the most recent current in which if we wanted we could draw reasons for bitter political contention or for insane personal resentment But while we were aware that not everyone would understand this choice of ours we decided to look not at what divided us but at what united us love for our country Love that everyone is free to interpret in his own way but that in fact has proved to be a strong enough glue to ensure the rapid achievement of a political synthesis Our vote is therefore strongly in favour for at least two reasons firstly because we see in the motion for a resolution issues on which we have committed ourselves together with our other colleagues in the majority during this year of government Let me mention a few the commitment to promote the use of deflated instruments of tax litigation and also to promote a finally orderly and rational management of the so called tax warehouse These are two issues on which an agreement had been reached with the Bagnai Fenu resolution Document XXIV No 53 approved in the Finance Committee on 12 October I also mention the interventions to facilitate the superbonus 110 avoiding penalising single family homes the ones that a certain press not close to the reality of the country and in particular its internal areas has renamed cottages and facilitating through their splitting the transfer of credits in full respect of legality but without hindering the recovery a topic also this the subject of innumerable amendments tabled by my Group also on measures being examined I also mention the theme of home therapies subject of the agenda G2 text 2 first signed by Senators Romeo and Castellone approved by this Assembly on April 8 2021 An increasingly topical theme as the unfolding of the evidence draws the various experts or self evident ones towards the need to face the pandemic with a more articulated approach as always demanded by the party to which I belong Or I would like to recall the issue of the cost of raw materials on which we have spoken a certain advance by depositing on 27 May last motion 1-00378 which perhaps deserved more timely attention from the Government and of course more than all others the commitment that the Government accepts to intervene to change the so called rules of the Stability and Growth Pact which are not rules because their application is largely discretionary as the facts have shown and they are not of stability and growth because it is necessary to suspend them when stability and growth are most needed This is an issue that we believe we have raised in times that are not suspicious I could add more but I do not make this list to plant flags a phrase dear to some of us because that is not the spirit On the contrary I do so in order to stress with gratitude the welcome and support that colleagues from other parties have given to proposals that we have had the opportunity to make because we have decided to be on board and that they have had the intelligence to accept because they have understood that they were made in a constructive spirit and not of prevarication The second important issue which supports our vote in favour of this motion for a resolution perhaps the most important one is the fact that it opens up the possibility of a timely appeal if circumstances require it the data from the International Monetary Fund indicate that they are already requesting it to the instrument of budgetary deviation This is to avoid the mistake made at the beginning of another crisis the pandemic one when a government carrying different competences let 's put it this way seriously underestimated the extent of the necessary intervention causing a degradation then difficult to recover of the situation Remember that the initial 3.7 billion went to over 100 billion resources needed to deal with the problem that the pandemic had created Of course with all this the DEF will also be perfectible moreover as I have just pointed out it contains in itself the seeds of its own improvement This government will be perfectible the majority who support it will be perfectible and of course possibly and with difficulty it is perfectible who speaks to you However I would like to repeat since it was not enough to say so that I find it funny I have no other terms ladies and gentlemen that here we receive lessons of austerity and financial hygiene from those who at the end of 2011 found this country with a public debt of 119 percent of GDP and handed it over to its successor with a debt of 132 Just to be clear in the post war period only the pandemic was able to do worse and I find it hilarious that it still insists on the story of future generations damaged by the prodigality of unconscious parents of spending parliaments These future generations should repay the debt as if the State were a commercial exercise whose business has a deadline which must be paid to creditors with any remaining active mass only that it does not work that way there is no date or at least I have no confidence in which the Italian State must bring down the clèr The public debt is supported as long as the country is able to honour interest payments and refinance the amounts due that is as long as the country grows A growing country does not create problems for future generations while a country that practices the rigor so dear to the heirs of a failed season and therefore failed of problems creates it And these problems are not the need to repay the debt I want to tell the millennials that they might come across in my speech that no one will ever knock on their door to ask for the refund of 2,000 billion cash this will not happen The problems that create rigour are the need to accept increasingly precarious working conditions to have to emigrate not to have adequate education and not to have a health system that meets the challenges of globalisation because the globalisation of challenges poses them and we are now fully aware of them Since we are talking about globalisation then a globalization whose crisis confirms so many of our intuitions let me say to avoid misunderstandings that it is not true that we have all mishandled globalisation Globalisation if it has been mismanaged has been mismanaged by those who could manage it because it was in power certainly not by those who were in opposition It has been mismanaged by those who have been led by easy enthusiasms by the empty and demagogic words of order that it pronounced to attract an easy consensus not by those who have taken on themselves the political and human cost of expressing a critical voice A little too easy to socialize now the losses of globalization after having tried with greater or lesser success to privatise its profits as well as frankly it is a little too easy to accuse in a more or less veiled way of a lack of seriousness a majority that instead will be an interested opinion my is proving in this as on other occasions to know how to work constructively towards the achievement of common objectives In a spirit of support for this joint effort I therefore

#BagnaiAlberto,BAGNAI L SP PSd Az Mr President I rise in an explanation of vote on behalf of the Lega Salvini Premier Group We have seen that the diligent Member of Parliament makes the list in these circumstances not the electoral list that occupied us so much last month but he does a bit of the shopping list and a little of the list of regrets Everyone has done theirs and I will only add some political considerations I am in an uncomfortable situation for once because those who spoke before me have basically already made the considerations I wanted to make and I repeat The first consideration is as follows we come from a parliamentary term which is seeing an early end during which several times even at the events that then led to its end the issue emerged in the political debate that could not go to the vote because one could not interrupt an emotion or at least one could not interrupt the parliamentary work The fact that we are here more or less reluctant but that we have worked more or less efficiently shows what Mr Gallone said before the exercise of democracy takes place in the vote and in the electoral campaign that election campaign which some competent people wanted to suspend in the name of the emergency is in fact not at all incompatible with the orderly functioning of the institutions I would like to stress this so that we remember it where ever I hope not before five years we find ourselves in such a gruesome need to work in loose rooms I would also like to remind you here in particular to some of our voters who have legitimately contested some of the choices we made during this parliamentary term that the presence of the Government is important in resolving the problems such as for example the turmoil created around the theme of the superbonus Having a competent presence such as that of the Undersecretary Freni which we have the honour to have expressed in this government in Parliament is unfortunately crucial It has always been and has been all the more so in this parliamentary term during which we have seen that the legislative initiative is essentially in the hands of the Government That of the superbonus was not an easy theme to dissolve and still remains a theme on which many knots should be loosened The point is that the problem of superbonus is not its cost as someone claims It would be hypocritical to think that If we like the environment we have to spend on the environment Neither are scams which are obviously a problem but could be dealt with with by appropriate controls The problem is the confrontation between two losing ideologies which see us both opposed on the one hand the ideology of bonuses that is free meals on the other hand the ideology of commodity money They 're two ideologies that are both failing In five minutes lucky for you I cannot explain why but what I can say is that when the elections have returned us a more ideologically compact and cohesive government we will remedy the

#PillonSimone,PILON L SP PSd Az Mr President we have listened to the Minister 's words However we cannot fail to point out to the House that the League had put forward some proposals in the course of its work in the Commission which we believe were essential What I said yesterday I repeat today the reform does not fully satisfy us It is a first timid step much more could be done and in our opinion there were also times to do much more In particular I am referring to an amendment which has a very important character namely the one with which we proposed that Parliament and not the Minister 's secretariat should draw up the electoral tables for the election of the MSC At the time when we delegate to the Ministry the drafting of the tables we dedicate ourselves to those same out of role magistrates whose function has been largely called into question in this House the determination of the electoral districts that will very much then be able to determine for the purposes of election to the MSM You then understand Madam Minister that it would actually save Parliament time because now it will have to be your secretariat that compiles the electoral tables defines the electoral districts and you will not be able to vote for the new MSC until those tables are made At this point it was appropriate to give back to Parliament sovereignty also over the determination of the electoral districts because the times would be essentially the same but in our opinion we would have made a gesture to give back to Parliament that is to say to popular sovereignty a very delicate aspect in relation to the life of the judiciary I wanted to make this example because time is short even if there would be other aspects Too bad That 's what happened I think that the real reform should take place in 2023 when the centre right wins the elections,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,8.039644,-15.6103945,39,pilon l sp psd az mr president listened minister 's words however cannot fail point house league put forward proposals course work commission believe essential said yesterday repeat today reform fully satisfy us first timid step much could done opinion also times much particular referring amendment important character namely one proposed parliament minister 's secretariat draw electoral tables election msc time delegate ministry drafting tables dedicate role magistrates whose function largely called question house determination electoral districts much able determine purposes election msm understand madam minister would actually save parliament time secretariat compiles electoral tables defines electoral districts able vote new msc tables made point appropriate give back parliament sovereignty also determination electoral districts times would essentially opinion would made gesture give back parliament say popular sovereignty delicate aspect relation life judiciary wanted make example time short even would aspects bad 's happened think real reform take place 2023 centre right wins elections
#PittoniMario,"PITTONI L SP PSd Az Mr President this measure introduces new measures for the implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan focusing in particular on the importance of digital transition and the use of new IT tools in different areas of society We all agree that it is important to respect the commitments made but it must also be clear that it is not enough to include new rules in a decree law in order to bring about a sustainable change for citizens and administrations It is not possible to reason only on target it is necessary that the regulatory interventions have fallen in reality that they are aimed at simplifying and improving the daily life of Italians also through a greater efficiency of the public administration The measure covers many areas An intervention that seemed fundamental to us to propose and support is that which immediately authorizes the recruitment of 500 students agents of the State Police to increase the services of prevention and control of the territory especially in the current context of serious social emergency It is essential to ensure the presence of law enforcement forces in order to prevent and combat criminal activities and possible terrorist initiatives as well as border control and control also connected to the development of the Jubilee of the Catholic Church in 2025 In the decree law we encourage digital payments to fight evasion and we have introduced mechanisms also to prevent possible fraud related to electronic payment instruments used in the lottery of receipts We have in fact inserted an explicit and punctual clarification on the legal constraint that imposes in order to participate regularly in the lottery the obligatory overlap between the tax code used to generate the lottery code and the tax code associated with the owner of the electronic payment instrument or of the funds held on the credit or bank or postal debt relationships used for the purchase The measure also provides for measures on infrastructure and cultural heritage as well as novelties for tourism justice the environment and there is a large chapter on the school but much remains to be done it will have to be done soon mainly to support the less large local authorities who are dealing with structural problems related mainly to the shortage of staff who risk seeing discoveries positions in the organic plant with infungable functions On this the administrations of the small municipalities did not find the answers they were looking for in the decree law and it is the task of this Government and this majority to provide it with urgency In the Commission we have improved the text with the extension of the possibility for public administrations to use all those who are concerned to meet the requirements for the implementation of the PNRR We have also approved our proposal for an extension to ensure that the municipalities concerned can include the process involved in the implementation of interventions on public goods for the benefit of the community The timing provided for in the basic text did not take into account the small municipalities up to 1,000 inhabitants let 's talk about 1,996 municipalities recipients of funding with a shortage of staff which were also overloaded for commitments and obligations related to the PNRR We express satisfaction with the acceptance of our fundamental request as Mr Pazzaglini said for the compensation to the municipalities affected by the 2016 earthquake of the Tari 's lack of revenue on the properties still unattainable We mean this when we think of concrete aid that can be benefited through the PNRR Let 's get to the school A success was undoubtedly the spirit of team patiently built in these months with authentic general evidence in the amending phase of the last decrees which allowed to receive unexpected results The compactness in carrying out at least the shared battles consolidated on this occasion allowed Parliament to re-appropriate at least part of the legislative function making the rapporteur of the Cangini measure say that more advanced school rules are being adopted than those laid down by the Government Thanks to the extraordinary compactness of the majority and the firmness of the Presidents of the Education and Constitutional Affairs Commissions we have obtained that the resources of the teaching card will not be touched Teacher training will be financed by an ad hoc fund until 2024 The government has committed itself to finding additional resources since the next budget law Of course denatality is a fact as is a fact however that Italy spends less on education than European partners we have pointed out it strongly obtaining that the savings due to the reduction in the number of students remain in the school sector Lights and shadows obviously remain on the ordinamental front where sharing is less easy there is openness even if it will be necessary to monitor the application criteria the training paths enabling to teach to which are interested in addition to those who teach in the state school second section of the provincial rankings for supplements in the peers where the shortage of qualified teachers makes themselves felt particularly and in the vocational training centers FP the teachers of so called caged role to whom the possibility of obtaining the qualification for teaching for a different class of competition and or for a different degree of education has so far been removed while possessing the title of suitable studies The achievement of the qualification is an essential condition to participate in the occupational mobility provided for by the national collective agreement of category CCNL And do not forget the doctors of research to which the experiential value of their journey must be recognized reaffirming at the same time the importance of attending and overcoming a specific training course dedicated to teaching in secondary school The question of the transitional phase for overcoming the historical precariousness cannot be considered closed On the contrary there is a contradiction between the European demand for greater attention in the selection of teachers and internal pressures with the imposition of a time frame out of reality to resolve the problem by exhuming the pre-selection in practice a competition to access another competition and cross tests certainly fast and economic but absolutely not able to evaluate attitude ability maturity and knowledge of the Italian language of teachers All this only to comply with the commitment to recruit new teachers by 2024 The recruitments if there is political will even with all the attention have never been a problem of times The doubt is that the use of mechanisms such as pre-selection and cross tests moreover already excluded from future competitions has in reality the objective not to facilitate but on the contrary to cut off the historical precariousness which even in the last decade has been charged to shore up the system The current cross competitions have in fact halved when not even reduced to a third the percentage of teachers who usually pass the test and certainly not because of lack of quality of competitors We will therefore fight for the extension of the transitional phase so as to remove any justification for the use of these instruments Going back to positive measures we have obtained access to specialization courses on support even without qualification for those who have three years of specific experience I remember that over a third of the teaching staff are not specialized There is the restoration in competitions of the merit rankings of the fit to cover the posts that subsequently become vacant and available We particularly cared together with the return of the interim allocation interprovincial important especially for mothers with small children a question that on other tables seems finally to start to solution There is the exemption of the school manager 's collaborators for emergency schools Finally there is the extraordinary competition for Catholic religious insecure persons with at least thirty six months of service in state schools The rankings following the extraordinary procedure will be used each year until their total exhaustion The time limits for submitting applications the procedures for carrying out the didactic methodological oral test and the evaluation of the same and the qualifications for the preparation of the rankings will be laid down by the Ministry of Education For these reasons I announce the favorable vote of the League Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#RipamontiPaolo,Mr President I have listened carefully to all the speeches that have been made in these more than three hours of general discussion I believe that there have been pertinent and exact interventions on the spirit of this bill All my colleagues have highlighted the work that has been done by the Commission the Government and the rapporteurs so I will not dwell on this in replying but I will make a general reasoning As I said before perhaps removing a few pebbles from my shoe but I think it is legitimate to do so even after the much work done I did not like the acceleration that at some point someone wanted to give to the approval of this bill I did not like it in the way in fact and this is because I have lived it I have experienced this measure strongly the more than 100 hearings the countless round tables with stakeholders and countless comparisons with the social partners and with all the majority forces I therefore found it inappropriate to speed up what we were asked for exclusively in the method because the awareness that work should be done that it should be done quickly but above all that it should be done well we had made it quite clear Mr President No one has ever escaped and no one has ever thought not even for a second of not bringing down the work of four months Then I do not mean how much work we have done and how much has been lost in the reasoning of bringing together in this provision Chamber and Senate to prevent there being alterations of involvement I repeat that I did not like the method I have a clear conscience from this point of view so I feel good about myself I feel like I have to and I 'm somehow convinced that I 'm taking the ball back to the other side of the field Despite all the work that has been done on the hydroelectric on the services on the derivations of gas on the whole part of health care and on everything that colleagues have said this measure seems to be only linked to the seaside world In short I cannot help but talk about it myself from this point of view partly because I am the son of a land that has given so much in terms of receptive activities and bathing Someone said that we all have a little responsibility it is absolutely true as Senator Faith said before and whoever is without sin throws the first stone No one here can throw a stone We 've all put in some of ours I claim Senator Misiani with great force beyond the fact that I appreciated his speech Law No 145 of 2018 I claim it with great force because it was a law that for two years Europe has never contested That is a fact he has never contested it It happened then that politics did not have the strength to finish the job When I said before we made a commitment to Europe and to this bill we kept it I wanted to mean that every now and then when we claim to make delegated decrees we should really do them and I put them all in because it concerned the first and second Count Government Then comes the judiciary which marks a point there again Senator Faith is right the chatter is at zero because a decision of the Council of State has arrived which was very clear Some people like it some people do n't like it some people say it 's not applicable it 's a matter of responsibility because some people have a store with a written above we 're responsible for what we do someone else has a store with a written on it we do n't have any responsibility I do not say that it is illegitimate I say that it is easier to say that on certain aspects and on certain topics it is necessary to do otherwise therefore no to Bolkestein therefore the expropriation therefore you have made an agreement to the bottom of the table therefore you have been dishonest to the country and so on This chatter is at zero because there is a Council of State and the responsibility that every Member of Parliament must assume at this stage is to ensure that those who have such a judgment on their backs are not abusive where they have been working for a hundred years It can never be because if someone comes and seizes that beach then the game is closed At the time we had these three fixed points compensation ensuring that there was a reasonable time even through the hope that the ANCI had put in place when it asked for more time to do things the rewards I cannot dwell on compensation because I can assure you that I too have a clear conscience and I believe that Mr Collina has it with me because at some point in the debate the issue was either residual value or value value and we were firm in words the climate that was created at that time was no longer sustainable We could n't do it Then I say that perhaps at this stage it is better for the Government to deal with it but I would ask for a great effort and a great test of confidence in those who are currently on our beaches set up a conciliation table immediately one minute after the adoption of this bill to start writing together the rules and criteria for compensation because that is where we give great strength to what this Parliament with great difficulty has done I will not dwell on the rewards because they are written very well within the bill small businesses family societies and those with experience are rewarded We also managed as my colleague Collina would say to get away something that was badly written the expression that also included those who had an experience in public goods who wanted to be able to put in even those who have experience in water pipes for example We said it was difficult to give a reward in this sense Well we have done so and we have done much more I shall conclude by making a reflection that may not even be my responsibility in fact but comes from one of the first speeches I heard from the opposition which drew to this very famous unity of the center right Well I accept the challenge but the unity of the center right would have wanted to see it within the Dragon Government to allow the center right to have a wider negotiating force This has not happened and I can not excuse you for this I can't excuse you You have a written sign that is not your responsibility It 's legitimate You will monetize but probably from this point of view the call to the center right was basically out of place,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,4.571399,-19.79838,39,mr president
