#JulioUtrillaCano,Thank you President Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen Gentlemen of Esquerra between you and us there is an abyss not only political and ideological but also of values You hate Spain and want to see it shattered We love our nation and believe in its unbreakable unity You hate our Police and Civil Guard from this rostrum you have said that you are savages and that you feel disgust and aversion to these occupying forces In VOX we feel not only a deep respect for the men and women of these bodies but also a huge gratitude and appreciation In VOX we believe in the freedom of the individual in the free choice of language for the education of our children in the freedom of expression in the freedom of religion you in the repression of everything above Today we highlight another of the fundamental differences between you and us If any party puts on the table an objectively good initiative for Spain we support it without blinking without doubt and from whomever comes You pack democrats systematically reject our proposals just because they are from VOX and do argumental contortionism to try to explain their refusal We have shown this on many occasions by voting in favour of his initiatives and of other parties Today we will again give them an example of coherence and support this initiative for the simple reason that it is good for science if it is not undermined by the changes and amendments of other parties We are submitting an amendment since Articles 4 and 5 of the Value Added Tax Act state that the research activity carried out by universities will be subject to value added tax only if as a result goods or services are delivered for a fee All transactions which are carried out without any consideration for them are therefore outside the scope of the tax In paladin roman and so that we understand each other when the university develops research projects without the objective of economically exploiting the results that it can obtain from them but in order to offer them to society as a whole without the aim of obtaining any compensation for them such activity would be not subject to VAT Let them be clear even though they call us negatists VOX has always been supporting science and will always support it Finally you are seen suffering because more and more workers are voting for us and supporting us They repeat it every time they come up to this rostrum and I guarantee in this past campaign in Castile and Leon through the streets and squares we have been approached countless autonomous currant to tell ourselves that we are their last hope and we will not fail them When you come up to this rostrum you are constantly wondering that if any of our VOX Members and a worker vote the same thing who is wrong about both of you I will tell you and resolve your dilemma you are the only ones who are wrong because the workers of Spain including the Catalans have tired of their betrayals and lies Who do you want to vote for To socialist gentlemen who spend their money in Andalusia on cocaine and prostitutes Yes gentlemen the EREs of Andalusia up to 680 million Or Mr. Echenique who blew up the only worker he had without paying his Social Security Can you imagine Mr. Echenique with a company of thousands of workers Or the communists of this country who instead of singing To the barricades in their anthem now sing to the shellfish Or to you gentlemen of Esquerra who promised the workers of Catalonia that they would be better off with the process that they would be richer and happier And Catalonia since then has not stopped losing productive tissue and winning ruin misery and social rupture We knew a few days ago that Volkswagen is taking the manufacture of electric motors to Hungary instead of doing it at its Martorell plant Another success of the separatist administration Congratulations They do n't cheat on anyone anymore Stop squandering on embassies and Mafia associations and devote all resources to research and science although this is as utopian as the independent republic that they want to impose on us Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,40.646,13.38379,22,thank

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,In short the successive governments of Spain have put the Spanish on their knees and at the dawn of the decisions of third countries of third bodies to which they have not voted and to which they do not control That is why we have to reverse this situation as soon as possible because the Spaniards are suffering and their measures or the measures they have implemented so far are not working That is why Minister we ask you in a concrete and specific way to tell us what you are going to do to improve the lives of the Spaniards And not only on a temporary basis in the face of the current war and the invasion of Ukraine but on a permanent basis because this crisis is not something of today Putin has not decided it but it is something that has been brewing for years So please tell us what measures they are going to take Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,42.910965,15.434265,22,short successive governments spain put spanish knees dawn decisions third countries third bodies voted control reverse situation soon possible spaniards suffering measures measures implemented far working minister ask concrete specific way tell us going improve lives spaniards temporary basis face current war invasion ukraine permanent basis crisis something today putin decided something brewing years please tell us measures going take thank much
#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Madam Minister sadly your answer is absolutely unsatisfactory I asked what they were going to do and what you said was what they did and you say that what they did is entirely satisfactory for the sector and that if the sector interprets it in another way because they read the rule because it seems to me that you do not know if you think they have not read it that they do not know how to read it or that they have not interpreted it His answer contains all the essential elements that the Socialist Party and Podemos answers contain by definition You have spoken of Franco you have spoken of Putin and of course you have spoken of the far right the fascists and so on And that 's your answer because it comes and it tells us no it 's that you are more orderly and commanding from other regimes pointing to VOX Madam Minister it is you your Government who illegally locked up all the Spaniards It was his Government that violated the Constitution up to three times with two illegal states of alarm and a closure of the illegal Congress declared by the Constitutional Court So by order and command you are and you are for that which interests you Because when you do n't know what to do what you announce are meetings committees talks etc. and you believe that sharing kisses and hugs will solve the problem of transport in Spain You come here and you tell us no it is that we close an agreement with the transport committee which represents 90 of the carriers Surrealist either you lie or you lie to them because the transport committee is supporting the ninth sector unemployment today And if supposedly you have reached agreements with 90 of the sector it must be that 10 of the sector is very strong because it is paralysing and collapsing the large areas of Spain So either lie to reality or lie to you but you do n't explain the situation I tell you that today precisely Fenadismer Fetransa and Feintra which are the three main platforms of the sector all of which are part of the committee have announced that they support and maintain the ninth day of unemployment So either lie to them in their statements or lie to you when you come up to this rostrum You say we are perfectly conscious No Minister you are absolutely unconscious and you do not know what situation you are bringing to the country All of Spain can tremble to its foundations for this transport crisis that you have caused And their hugs understanding and understanding will not help solve problems until they take concrete action Those concrete measures which you say you had agreed with the sector had been agreed upon in November and you did not pass the royal decree law in the Council of Ministers you do not need a majority it is the Council of Ministers until March In these measures which you have included there is indeed the indexation of contracts to fuel prices but it is a three month indexation And if you had passed the royal decree when the agreement was adopted in November it could have been satisfactory but we are in a situation where fuel prices are rising day by day On the same day there are increases in fuel prices and you come and tell our truckers that the price will be indicated at three months I mean do you have to put up with them for three months with your pocket the rising fuel prices that you PP and PSOE with their climate policies have caused with the criminalization of hydrocarbons and CO2 emissions With rules on CO2 emissions restrictions which have been increasing year by year since 1990 when the Commission adopted the first plan for reducing CO2 emissions you rather than establishing a secure and stable framework at every year are increasing it every year and you support it That is precisely the problem of the sector which you have installed in Spain in legal uncertainty which offers hugs and understanding but does not establish any concrete measures despite the fact that you are in the government and that you have the BOE Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,40.588573,14.94212,22,madam minister sadly answer absolutely unsatisfactory asked going said say entirely satisfactory sector sector interprets

#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,Minister there are a number of doubts Either you 're terribly wrong or you 're lying shamelessly It comes and tells us that the 2030 Agenda was approved by a public consultation process Who did you consult with The same people who participate in the interviews now with Pedro Sánchez The same people who take part in Pedro Sánchez 's TV show Did you consult with those people It is the Spanish people who must be consulted who will be harmed by the measures that you are taking That is who you have to consult and you are consulted in the ballot box You in your proposal in your political programme concealed all these measures and worse still conceal the direct consequences of those measures Therefore you did not consult Spain Moreover when Spain is consulted recently in Castile and León and Andalusia it has said no to you He sent them home because he is aware that the policies they are implementing are harmful to the Spaniards It tells us that Spain was in a privileged situation because of its low dependence on Russian gas I can admit it but it 's just that as a matter of fact you go and dynamite the relationship that avoided that dependence Its president explicitly insults Algeria flying almost literally the only pipeline that freed Spain from Russia 's dependence and putting us in Putin 's arms so much so that Spain has multiplied its purchases of Russian gas in recent quarters It is a real shame that you dare to come here to say that we had little dependence because if we had little dependence you as nefarious socialist rulers who are have dynamized that independence You say I am proud to be European Like it 's a monopoly of yours Madam Minister I believe that we are all proud to be Europeans and Spaniards and Asturians of course but that does not mean that we have to acristically accept all the policies that the European Commission sends us when they are particularly harmful to Spain to the Spanish countryside to the Spanish fishermen to our farmers I can respect my father very much but when he 's wrong I 'll have to have the critical ability to tell him You seem to welcome here the dogmas that send you absolutely acritic both these European Commission rules which harm Spain as much as the 2030 Agenda which harms the Spaniards so much You speak without indecent of the weather emergency dropping the issue of fires Madam Minister the fires have been caused by you by the disastrous management of the forest mass of Spain which you have restricted to the maximum You have prevented our farmers our farmers and rural Spain from managing the countryside in the traditional way they did and that is why in the countryside and the Spanish mountain which is uncultivated uncultivated and unexploited the potentially combustible forest mass is multiplying which has caused the fires that we have faced That 's the point You talk about industrial energy autonomy I do n't know what your plan would be Minister but you 're getting exactly the opposite Spain is today less autonomous and more dependent on external energy Spain is now more dependent less independent therefore on industrial matters without going further ArcelorMittal in Asturias has announced the closure of one of the blast furnaces and Celsa has closed this summer for four consecutive weeks some of its plants in Asturias when never in forty years of existence of the group had produced such a closure Renewable energy Minister is fantastic but do n't burn the boats Start with renewable energy let 's push as we continue to take advantage of the other energy sources that we have in Spain The day will come when renewable energy will be able to supply all of Spain 's supply sure but until then do n't restrict the rest of the energy sources which is precisely why prices are unstable volatile and rising just the opposite of what you say in your intervention And you 're talking about the momentum of the ecological transition We have already told you boost the exploitation of irrigation in Spain and promote the interconnection of the water basins of Spain That would really boost the ecological transition because what you are doing is putting the Spaniards on the street and if not asking the workers of Arcelor Celsa or the automotive sector all of them on the street for their sectarian and dogmatic policies Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,42.33429,15.472955,22,minister number doubts either 're terribly wrong 're lying shamelessly comes tells us 2030 agenda approved public consultation process

#MaríaDeLaCabezaRuizSolás,Gentlemen of Bildu only those who have the vocation to serve Spain should sit in this House and we all know that you are not here for that You have no moral authority to defend any cause in this House because the first cause that any good politician should defend is life and you do not do so You continue to think that there are causes that justify death that your causes did justify the death of innocent people and that is why we cannot argue with you as if you were another parliamentary group It is absolutely impossible for us because we cannot forget where you come from who you are why you are here and how much innocent blood was shed so that you could get to where you are So no gentlemen of Bildu you have no moral authority to go up to this rostrum or to talk about the price of light or to talk about anything because the mere fact that you are here is a stab at the back of democracy and those who died to defend it is a stab at the back of all Spaniards But as much as this cruel injustice hurts us the reality is that you are here and that today you come to reproach with your small mouth to scold only a little bit the government you support the government that could not carry out any of your projects without you and that has not kept your promise to lower the price of light They 'll forgive me but you have to be a hypocrite Does the Lemoniz nuclear power plant sound like anything to you gentlemen of Bildu The 1970s were going on and then we did n't even know what climate change was however theirs were already used thoroughly to paralyze their construction Up to three hundred times it was attacked and on 17 March 1978 its predecessors Lords of Bildu planted a bomb that failed to paralyze that nuclear project but which took forward the lives of the first two victims of their ecological struggle which they have been colonizing since then There were two humble workers Andrés Guerra and Alberto Negro and there were fourteen others wounded A year later in 1979 they planted a second bomb that caused the death of another worker Ángel Baños but as they still did not achieve their goal on 29 January 1981 they kidnapped José María Ryan The following day they issued a communiqué in which they conditioned their release on the decision of the Spanish Government to demolish the nuclear power plant within seven days Remember gentlemen of Bildu Because thousands of people went to the streets to ask their terrorists those whom you protect and honor not to fulfill their threat but for nothing as it did not serve years later with Miguel Ángel Blanco On the night of 6 February he was shot in a jar and left his body abandoned on a forest road He was thirty eight years old and five children and he was killed only because he worked as a chief engineer in the construction of the Lemoniz nuclear power plant They did the same thing weeks later with their heroic substitute Ángel Pascual Mújica in front of their own son In total five murders It was the blood of five innocent people that served them to achieve their goal cruelly considered then as one of ETA 's great victories to which the Socialist government of Felipe González sadly contributed by approving its famous nuclear moratorium three years later in 1984 But the dismantling of the Lemoniz plant not only cost us the lives of five innocent people something that could not be paid even with all the gold in the world It also cost us EUR 6 billion to which we must add what cost us the dismantling of other power plants that were being built in those years Do n't you think that in today 's light receipt we 're not paying for the consequences of your yesterday 's decisions Well of course we 're paying them And not only that but if all the nuclear power plants that were planned had been built those whose energy is now being considered as green energy we would probably not see ourselves today as we see ourselves poor and energy dependent unable to achieve for our citizens a fair price for the light they consume You with your political selfish and murderous opportunism are directly responsible for the high price we pay for light You like the Socialist Party have since contributed to the loss of our country 's energy sovereignty which has led us to the situation that now has the defachability to denounce How can you come here to say to the Government to your Government to that Government you support that your measures have not served to end the energy poverty that you have contributed to generating You that the only thing you have brought to our country and your own land has been death and ruin Gentlemen of Bildu for us there is only one thing you can do in this House go up to this rostrum and deny what your predecessors did publicly acknowledge that this was monstrous that they would never have had to resort to crime to achieve their goals that they sincerely repent that they are hurt by every innocent victim they caused and that they will contribute to the clarification of the pending attacks and the reparation of the victims If you do not we will have no choice but to keep reminding all the Spaniards in each of our speeches what you are and where you come from because we simply cannot allow the death of so many innocent victims for all of us and for our freedom to have been in vain Thank you very

#PabloJuanCalvoListe,Thank you Mr. President Signore Regó the A6 motorway connects Madrid Spain with La Coruña Spain It also travels important localities such as Medina del Campo Tordesillas Benavente La Bañeza Astorga Ponferrada Villafranca del Bierzo Piedrafita Lugo and Betanzos all also in Spain I mean Mr Rego it does n't connect as you say Galicia with the Peninsula as if there was the Strait of Gibraltar by the way also Spanish This is just in your imagination another separatist dream Wake up Galicia is Spain Well on the A6 or northwest highway on June 7th one of the thirteen vanes of the Castro viaduct 585 meters long collapsed in the municipality of Vega de Valcarce the last village of El Bierzo in León It has been closed to traffic since 2021 when it was rehabilitated after an inspection On 16 June a second collapse occurred diverting traffic through the N VI resulting in damage to all populations and users of this route logically increasing the risk of an accident While investigating the causes of collapse for which VOX already asked the government in the following days and as a result the responsibilities are clarified the only fact true today is the obvious lack of maintenance of our infrastructures and in this case of a very important one in the heart of the Spanish interior of rural Spain which is nothing other than Spain abandoned by you and by you which are more to announce infrastructures and inaugurate them than to ensure their conservation But of course we already know where the electoral revenue is as Mr Rego now claims with this motion The minister absent will say that it is invested in forecasting and maintenance and that there are the budgets but the truth is that an important viaduct has collapsed with less than twenty five years of age something unprecedented And it is that according to experts it is invested four times less than necessary to have the highways in optimum condition It is this disaster that would have been avoided with foresight and resources We need to invest effectively and in what is important VOX has already told you that you do not know how to invest effectively because you do not know how to budget nor do you know how to invest in what is important because ideological sales prevent you from doing so In Spain we have very good professionals so I hope that the multidisciplinary team of technicians who are working on it will not be like the committees of experts to which this Government is accustomed The problem once again is the Government You prefer to design a plan to charge tolls to all users rather than design one for effective maintenance and maintenance guaranteeing and extending their service life Do the Spanish no longer pay with their increasingly high taxes maintenance in infrastructure Do n't you issue public debt for that What is actually what should be intended for maintenance or rather what is it spent on Either we invest in birth in the rural world in health in education in defense in maintaining infrastructure or we invest in ideology in limiting freedoms in raising taxes in making life impossible for the Spaniards in developing globalist agendas ultimately losing sovereignty in all areas Ladies and gentlemen on 7 and 16 June we witnessed the collapse of the Castro viaduct Very soon thanks to VOX we will also witness the collapse of this evil government

#SantiagoAbascalConde,True Mr. Sánchez careful with the healers are the false doctors those who blame the others for the financial crisis while they during that same crisis were counselors nothing more and nothing less than Caja Madrid Ladies and gentlemen no debate no state no nation We face a session with a government and investment partners unable to agree on what the state is and what the nation is It seems an easy game of words but it comes to the case to illustrate that strange alliance that Macedonian in the words of Mr Sánchez who said that he would take away his dream when the truth is that the dream and dreams have been volatilized in millions of Spanish homes during his government while you come here to this debate about the state of the nation and use half of the intervention to talk about the Ukrainian nation the Russian nation the Chinese nation and the Supreme Court of the United States Nor can it be said that the ladies and gentlemen of the blue bank and the majority who support it are too close to the debates That is neither State nor nation nor debate because while you speak of tolerance you do not accept the free confrontation of ideas and arguments and we have seen that what you called the new policy has remained in a mixture of propaganda misinformation demonization of the adversary manipulation and even at times violence against the opposition instigated and exercised by the Government Between shouts and subsidies this government with the help of a large part of the media is issuing closed debates and calls for reactionaries to which we oppose Of course we reacted You 'd want us to stay compared and quiet They have even tried to turn into banned debates the very questionable principles that have inspired all their political action And no Mr Feijóo I take this opportunity to greet you and welcome you they are also not sterile debates as you have said on some occasion I 'm sorry because I know you can't answer me but believe me I 'm telling you with all due respect and humility These are not sterile debates The left says that there are prohibited debates and many times you say that these debates are smokescreens and are sterile debates just because you do not want to confront the left but the left in the end makes its political agenda move forward It does not serve that position which in reality seeks only to conceal that we are being banned from discussing essential issues that have direct consequences for the well being of people and also direct consequences for the economy security and the most basic rights and freedoms Moreover according to the Constitutional Court VOX 's appeals have seriously violated the rights and freedoms of Spanish people on three occasions He 's done it with impunity but they 're still sitting on the blue bench He went to the rostrum this morning to say that the rulings of the Constitutional Court or the appeals that arise are swords of Damocles How does the Constitution claim saying that the Constitutional Court which watches over legality is a sword of Damocles Nor is it barren to hold this government accountable no matter how uncomfortable it may be that only VOX in this House would oppose that violation of the legality represented by the covert state of emergency As you can imagine we are not going to accept that public authorities or private powers decree the closure of the debates that is the end of democracy Nor are we going to pretend that these debates really do not matter because we believe that our duty is to represent millions of Spaniards who know that the ruin that haunts them is not the result of chance or the sole result of an epidemic or a war but fundamentally of sectarianism often with totalitarian forms that have imposed rulers who are very concerned about world agendas such as the pin of the 2030 Agenda that you carry today in the flap and that carry all the powerful in the world that you now say that they are watching you and chasing you and by your own personal agenda which consists only of obeying the dictates of those who are betting on those agendas But they always forget the interests of the Spanish they always forget the interests of Spain and that Mr Sánchez is the state of the nation Beyond the concretions that each of us puts forward throughout today in various areas of government such as the economy such as social services or international politics the fact is that the situation of Spanish people is very serious and runs the risk of being dramatic if those who do not serve or respect them continue in institutions and use them only for their personal objectives and ideological sectarianism And believe me that this reality that I find I am not happy even though I am sure it will be the foreword and the cause of your out of power I 'm so sorry I am sorry Mr Sánchez even if you do not believe it the opposition so hard that we have been forced to do so I regret that from the first day you deceived the Spaniards by establishing a pact that you had promised would not happen I know it bothers you to remember this in all my interventions but I am morally obliged to do so because it affects legitimacy as a ruler Is it legitimate for a politician twenty four hours after the election to do exactly the opposite of what he promised the voters This House will have to reflect on that Similarly he regretted that those who tried to break national unity with a separatist coup had been pardoned by this Government And he denounced that the project of the former vice president to incorporate ETA into the state leadership has taken to the almost pornographic end that it is precisely Bildu who dares to dictate the memory of the Spaniards and that it is precisely the lehendakari Sánchez who used Ermua to whiten and legitimize his purpose in a sad act in which they have spattered in indignity I 'm sure a lot of socialists share this just like we do This is a government sustained in the lie in the lie of historical memory forgetting for example Calvo Sotelo and I say this on the eve of the crime that killed him and that triggered the Civil War by the way committed by socialist militias escorted from a minister and a government sustained in the lie of whitening ETA using these days nothing but the figure of Miguel Ángel Blanco whose anniversary of death we also celebrate today They are crimes committed one by a Socialist Party and the other by a separatist and socialist terrorist organization You are the emulsions of the old and criminal Popular Front ladies and gentlemen Those crimes that they want to erase are not going to get them forgotten by any sectarian and totalitarian law that they pass in this House Nor is that debate sterile nor does it correspond to any trauma of those who have suffered in the first person the attacks of a criminal and mob gang It 's simple common sense It is simply to understand that those who have dedicated and still dedicate their entire political life to destroying Spain with all the means at their disposal are not fit to defend the interests of Spain and the Spanish no matter how many partners they are And I do not think I am saying any barbarity because the fact that they want to break Spain is something they have said openly and publicly in this Chamber That is why Mr Sánchez by that pact with which you voluntarily move away from the national agreement with which you have sworn right here to trample the Constitution again you are going to leave Spain ruined faced deteriorated institutionally and internationally weakened That is why ETA in its parliamentary version lends its support to them because that divided weak and confronted Spain is exactly what they have been looking for for decades It is true and I also regret it that Mr Sánchez has sometimes found himself more allies than the extremists who always support him For example I refer to climate laws that terrible mistake that the Spanish pay every month in their energy bills in the shopping basket and in the shortage of decent and stable jobs Ladies and gentlemen this green pact has led us to an energy emergency Only some very extreme religious fanaticisms have come to your nonsense the law which consists in renouncing to exploit our natural resources those of our nation even at the cost of the ruin of the citizens Of course it is good and desirable to continue to increase renewable energy sources who doubts this absolutely no one in this House but it is a capital irresponsibility to impose an energy transition at the expense of the well being and prosperity of citizens and always of the humblest Ladies and gentlemen in Spain there is gas there is coal there is lithium and probably there is oil in canary waters and there is very advanced technology to continue and not only to continue but to extend the nuclear programme with complete certainty However you have by law banned access to these resources in this House you have even celebrated the blasts of thermal power plants at a critical time of scarcity It 's been like watching them applaud the fire of wheat fields at a time of famine It is an absolute nonsense although it is true that in that you only follow other European governments Mrs Merkel will pass into history as the governess who decided that the continent 's industrial and food energy supply would become dependent on the will of leaders and governments far away and at times very hostile as we are now seeing And today the consequences are paid by the Ukrainians in their meats and by the Europeans in their pockets But not even now that European countries are speedily rectifying such as Germany and Austria that they are opening up new coal plants not even now that Brussels has declared nuclear energy and gas as green energy not even now you have been deigned to repeal the laws that prevent our economic development and the prosperity of our homeland That is why we come here not to ask you to ask us to ask you to ask you to rectify to do it today better than tomorrow to return to the path of common sense to return together with the interests of the Spanish people and to abandon those oligarchies of obscene fortunes which do not give up their luxuries or excesses which carry in the flap the same pin as you which always manage to avoid all sacrifices and which at the same time pretend to convince the Europeans that we must live worse while their results accounts yes do not stop increasing Only through censorship and misinformation can we maintain that absurd course that forces us to stop producing what we need while we buy it ruining ourselves those who contaminate without limit far from here and again contaminate to bring it here You are experts in exporting pollution and in exporting employment Only from sectarianism can one continue to defend a course that ruins Europeans weakens them internationally compromises our security and moreover as is evident and we are seeing does not represent the least benefit to the health of the planet Is there really no one among the left wing leaders in this House who misses the absolute coincidence of the postulates on this issue with the great business and personal fortunes of the world Does no one really have the honesty to wonder why the craziest speeches of climate fanaticism that we have heard so many times in this rostrum are the same literally the same ones that we heard from the big bankers the CEOs of the big multinationals or the big investment funds Does n't anyone in this House think so They still do not understand why workers throughout Europe and has just passed in Andalusia are turning their backs on them absolutely throughout the continent It is very simple because more and more Europeans and more Spanishs see and suffer the consequences of these oligarchies and powerful ideas that you seem to share but which they do not dare or do not want to contradict Consequences that are not abstract explanations of a Member in this rostrum but that are realities such as the state of the nation that Mr Sánchez presides where public debt is 117 and inflation is 10 the inflation that you are taking advantage of to collect and elude the Spanish and that is the worst tax against the middle classes and against the working classes Energy whether gasoline diesel gas or electricity has in some cases doubled You come here with some fake boards talking to us about the wholesale cost of energy but you do n't say how much it costs in homes These are data from the European Commission Mr Sánchez This is the highest price in red in red always bad and in green are the lowest energy prices in households across Europe This is the reality Mr. Sánchez not the numbers you bring here to lie and to confuse It is also true that young people today charge half of what young people paid in 1980 and that is what those who have jobs because we have the highest youth unemployment in Europe You said that every now and then it 's best to look back Well let 's do it with an example because memory is n't just for wars of past centuries In 1997 a rent cost 46 of an average pension today it is 103 of the average pension And while the abusive taxes take away a large part of the workers income after that confiscation they have to fill the shopping basket or light their homes and re-pay taxes with every drop of gasoline they consume or with every dish they fill for their children And when the taxpayer exhausted and ruined whether entrepreneur self employed employee or wage earner on behalf of others complains it still remains defachable enough to tell him that he has to pay 20 billion euros in equality policies for Mrs Montero and for her dozens of associations of friends friends and friends What exactly is the plan Mr Sánchez and Mrs Montero which is no longer there Make all Spaniards the same poor I remember that in 2015 you expressed your desire I say it textually to be remembered as the politician who managed the economy in Spain In the first part of the statement I have to give you the reason you will be remembered so you may be calm but I am afraid that is not what I intended Moreover when you speak the bread goes up you have come up here to announce measures to collect an additional 1.5 billion from the bank and at twenty minutes it has caused losses for small savers and a scare for investors worth 6 billion euros That 's you Mr. Sanchez You have brought ruin and in the face of this panorama I regret that only an autonomous government that of Castile and León has dared to cut subsidies to employers organizations and trade unions to allocate it to social emergencies I would like to congratulate the People 's Party on having complied with its government agreement because all Spaniards need to see that at this time of difficulty given the gravity of the situation there are politicians who are aware that we must cut unnecessary expenditure and devote them to what is important I encourage you to follow this same course in other institutions I also encourage you to stop obstructing the repeal of the Historical Memory Act in Castile and León and its replacement by a law of concord as it was agreed and to do the same if it suits you in Andalusia Because of course we must cut the money wasted on employers in trade unions and in parties in organizations that do not defend the workers It is clear with what we are counting and with the panorama that the Spaniards are suffering that social peace cannot be bought by bribes to organizations to subject the legitimate protests of the citizens that they see that their pantry is emptied as long as the politics fattens up to the rude and expands to get into our homes in our consciences in our memory and even in biology if necessary as with that trans law that Mrs Montero brings and that she has put up with war the feminists of all her life that now capriciously a man can acquire the status of woman often a young man or a child without sufficient maturity that will end as in other countries when he has made irreversible decisions because of the confusion that you have led him to hormoneize or mutilate denouncing the governments that favored him You must be personally responsible with your assets for the million dollar compensation that the State will have to pay and that is already being claimed in other countries Nor is this a sterile debate gentlemen of the People 's Party an important debate If you are willing to be firm on this issue I would ask you to also have a commitment to repeal if we have the opportunity to do so I believe that only with this firmness can we build a real alternative with our legitimate differences broad in some respects but an alternative that serves to give the Spaniards what they claim and it is the expulsion of this Government and all the policies that this Government has brought We of course formally commit ourselves to doing so we commit ourselves to repealing all the extremist legislative filth that has been brought into this House and the separatist illegalities It did n't shake our wrists We 'll repeal everything as soon as we get a chance We will repeal all sectarian laws away from the interests of the Spaniards and from any consensus that has been imposed during these years from the law of climate suicide to the laws of fiscal kidnapping from the law of brutal promotion of abortion to the law of euthanasia from the law of educational reform to that of historical memory which by the way we will resort to the Constitutional Court to have another sword of Damocles because it attacks freedom of conscience freedom of expression and freedom of chair Also the transversal gender laws which have ended the real equality of men and women creating something so surprising in the world as special courts for men at the same time and I have already told it in the motion of censure that they have made it possible for man to capriciously declare that he is a woman You really do n't get to see the nonsense I do n't think it 's barren to oppose this mistake no matter how hard they seem to have the wrong ones In fact the fertility of democratic politics is demonstrated when through debate and confrontation of arguments and the vote can be undone the mistakes or follies that propaganda or force had become law as it has been during these years of shoemaking and sanchism I have already mentioned on two occasions as an example the law of historical memory that grave mistake that you are going to turn by the hand of ETA 's political arm into democratic memory Democratic with ETA law of memory etarra rather Some believe that the papers endure absolutely everything but it is not surprising because you are installed in the political lie just like your political ascendants It is like when the Soviet bloc erected a wall in the middle of Europe which was absolutely unprecedented in history to prevent its citizens from fleeing and you called it a wall of anti-fascist protection But finally beyond the not white hands with whom you bring this project do you really believe that desecrating graves is the task of a government Do you really believe that the situation in Spain requires looking for fratricidal grievances from wars of another century or another millennium rather Or is it rather that Mr Sánchez requires in order to maintain his parliamentary majority to grant anything and that we do not talk about what really concerns the Spaniards Is it really necessary to have to listen in Spain to a radio announcer from Grupo Prisa a company that has been rescued by governments of both signs saying that a Christian basilica must be blown up and that if possible it must be done on Sunday Have you all gone crazy Has not so much exercise in memory taught them that those who dream of returning to hatred and violence must be expelled from public life Do you think it 's moderately serious to destroy the highest cross in the world to give yourself a sectarian taste For our part you know that because we have told you many times we will rebuild everything that you destroy and lift everything that you destroy from the economy to the crossings I regretted at the beginning of my speech all the suffering that the Spanish are suffering as a result of the worst possible government at such a complex international time and I am also sorry that I have not been able to support the measures that the Government has taken but I believe that given the effects of so many measures and so many announcements no one will ever doubt that we have succeeded and that we will continue to fail to support this government that we have been successful for a long time in the forecasts we made in the motion of censure which sadly have been carried out behind one another And the same is true of the international scene In this political personality disorder suffered by this Government we have seen in this very legislature how the Government illegally brought a declared enemy from Morocco and claimed by various courts for very serious crimes We also know from Morocco that Mr Sánchez without asking his Government Parliament or his party has changed the historical position on the Sahara from a pen This had never happened in democratic Spain When he brought the leader of the Frente Polisario he got Morocco to launch a migratory avalanche which suffered our guards and the neighbors of Ceuta and Melilla When unexpectedly he gave the diplomatic turn acknowledge that I am generous calling diplomacy to what you do provoked another avalanche this time because Algeria opened the border to bring pressure to Morocco and again the problem ended in Melilla in the Spanish in the guards and in the police defending the border Ladies and gentlemen Morocco has an obligation to defend its interests and we cannot criticize it for that The fact that Spain for example has not taken reprisals as it should have done against some European countries that have welcomed terrorists and coupsmen in the 2017 coup does not mean that Morocco or other countries in the face of similar aggravations stand by their arms And now after the pirouette it is Algeria that exerts pressure and unfortunately has a very effective way of doing so because of the foolish green pact which has made us dependent and which prevents us from exploiting our resources In short you have created a border problem a humanitarian problem and an energy problem all at the same time Someday we will know why it has done so but it is clear that this change of position does not follow the interests of Spain Should we have a good relationship with Morocco Of course As soon as Morocco recognizes without nuances the Spanishness of Ceuta Melilla the Canary Islands and the territorial waters Good fences make good neighbors And speaking of the fence and the migratory pressure he welcomed having for the first time heard a clear complaint about the immigration mafias I think it 's about time although you have to understand that these mafias exist precisely because they operate with the cooperation of Spanish NGOs the same ones that you water with subsidies These mafias Mr Sánchez would not exist if Spain sent the clear message to the whole of Africa that whoever enters illegally will be returned that he will never be able to regularize his situation here and that he will never receive social aid because it is necessary to end that effect called that you all perpetuate It is the best announcement for the mafias who traffic with human beings and at last I have been proclaiming myself for years you have decided to denounce them But the question is if you 're going to dare end the mobs Are you going to dare to put an end to the so called effect of which you live Are you going to dare to put an end to subsidies to NGOs working with them I 'm sure you do n't Another question for the bench on the left as on the climate issue Have you never reflected on your coincidence with the powerful with those huge oligopolies who want to lower wages at the cost of mass immigration Will they never defend the interests of the Spaniards who see how their real wages and security in their neighborhoods go down Because Mr Sánchez although some of us are being made so long in fact not so long ago you were in Moncloa and I remember that before your government inclusive language gender laws zebra steps of colors and 20 billion equality in Spain there had been no normalization of that horrendous and aberrant crime of herd rape but now there are weeks in which we have learned of several Today women with this Government are more afraid than before Does this not deserve any thought either Why do women now enjoy less security than before you came to power I also regret that in the face of such a repugnant crime which I am sure is scandalous in this House we are not able to take joint action The penalties must be raised but the left always prefers to talk about reintegration and I already feel the coincidence but most of these savages are committed by individuals who should never have entered Spain Can we not stop painting rainbows in the steps of zebras and ensure that those criminals who despise both women and homosexuals return to the prisons of their countries and never see the sunlight again as Mrs Le Pen but Mr Macron has proposed by the way now in France not Mrs Le Pen but Mr Macron It does n't look like it 's the other way around You are publishing right now kind tutorials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explaining to those in Spain how they can cancel criminal records to access Spanish nationality It seems to us that this is not the best way to regain the security of so many neighborhoods in Spain Mr Sánchez Nor has it chosen well to pursue our global defence that is our defence policy because despite taking many photos with NATO leaders it has been unable to get that organization to protect our African cities but it has been very able to get its acolyte media to say that it has done so even though it does not appear in any text and there is no compromise Moreover you have not been able to clear the mistrust that your Government produces in many chancelleries Believe me and I say this to you with knowledge for many photos that give you no one forgets that in your government and in the parliamentary majority that supports you you have declared enemies of the Atlantic Alliance You have in your Government members of the Puebla Group which should be called the Puebla cartel which for example keeps the former President of Bolivia Jeanine Áñez kidnapped and you have in your Government declared enemies of the West In this matter of defense I recognize again that surprising agility for the pirouettes You said when you were in the opposition that the Ministry of Defence had to be closed and now you suddenly assume VOX 's proposal to increase defence spending to 2 of gross domestic product Well welcome again to the far right cheater or any of the labels that you your Government and your media had placed on us Welcome to xenophobia to denounce illegal immigration and mafia Welcome to Francoism and self government recognizing that it is unwise to increase energy industrial and food dependence and depend on unstable countries Welcome too to chinophobia Do you remember what you were laughing at me in the motion of censure when I warned you of the threat China posed Welcome to oppressive centralism with that state plan that aims to combat fires or with that health coordination centre Welcome to the defense of Poland to which you had brutally demonized And welcome also Mr. Sanchez to the conspiracies Do you remember those strange movements you made in this rostrum when you spoke to him about the coincidences of the powerful with your speech about China immigration or gender You should get them back to tell us who those dark powers are those contubers who say they 're after you Really who are they Maybe the TV duopoly you 've been watering with grants The boss who rushes to his rescue Gentlemen in pure I said Is that Felipe González Is that Indra We will talk about the induced and the assault on companies and institutions at another time In any case Mr Sánchez and he concluded if you feel threatened politically all we ask of you is that you do not order another state of covert emergency because I fear you are capable The most reasonable thing is that he resigns not because there are dark conspiracies against his person but because Spain needs as soon as possible that you leave to recover the wisdom and to fight the ruin that you leave us To do this Spain does not need you to be relieved simply as some believe and want Spain needs a complete alternative to all its policies When you are not Spain will recover the debates the state and the nation You said in your first speech that you are going to study all the proposals that the groups have made to you We have made fifteen proposals to him We 're worth studying one the one she 's leaving You came here with a confrontational aggressive sectarian

#SantiagoAbascalConde,the sophists like you who have no appreciation for the truth who believe that truth does not matter that truth does not exist and that it is worth any trick or trap with such as to confuse the masses which by the way you no longer confuse Mr Sánchez the Spaniards have run out of patience and your Government is running out of traps That 's why you do n't go out anymore Where 's your loyalty Mr. Sanchez Where 's your loyalty Today we are going to talk about it and it is not a rhetorical question because I believe that many in this House are not right to guess it In your change of position on the Sahara which has been irresponsible which has been arbitrary and which has been clandestine to whom do you obey Its party is clear that not because it was not on its electoral agenda and some Socialist Members and Senators have publicly shown their discomfort with this issue By the way he 's bothered them more than his deal with Bildu and ETA Nor does it seem to its government partners In fact the Government 's explanation for the illegal entry into Spain of the head of the Frente Polisario responsible for the disappearance and death among others of many Canary sailors is still pending To this House where national sovereignty resides it is clear that you do not obey either because we are now talking about that letter that you have unilaterally sent at your own risk Nor do your voters we already knew that twenty four hours after the elections in which you lied to them and we will remind you here until the last day of this parliamentary term Nor have you been loyal Mr Sánchez to the interests of Spain and that is the first obedience that a President of the Government must have It is not in Spain 's interests that a foreign newspaper discloses a change of stance in Spain 's international policy that does not endorse either a party a government a parliament or an electorate which you alone endorse Moreover what has happened is an affront to Spain The letter you have sent is an insult to this Parliament It is an insult to this Parliament to the letter you sent to the King of Morocco Yes that letter that he now denies says that there is no change of position because other governments said that Morocco 's contribution was credible and that it had to be valued It is that you have said that it is the most serious credible and realistic basis You have subscribed to the position of Morocco He says he has done so in line with our European partners You 've gone far beyond them But in line with the dictate Whose dictate Mr. Sanchez An affront and an insult to this Parliament that the Spanish will again pay because only you can think of this destabilization in the middle of an energy and social crisis caused by you we will talk about it extensively and by your submission to climate fanaticism Therefore I insist you have a duty to answer to who is loyal I doubt that you have the courage to clarify this in this Parliament Or is it simple megalomania Do you think you have the right to get up in the morning and do whatever you want and decide what new catastrophe the Spaniards are going to experience Because you have told us many things here that relations with Morocco are a matter of state we know the importance of trade relations that the crisis with Morocco at the border will be resolved that it will be better to control that border and that future crises must be avoided Of course there 's a problem with Morocco You have caused it among other things by welcoming here one of the leaders of the Frente Polisario and increasing it by favoring the so called effect that Morocco has been using permanently against our border And of course by giving in as you 've done it 's not going to work out In fact the President of the Moroccan Government has just claimed Ceuta and Melilla as part of Morocco He just did it after his assignment Congratulations Mr. Sanchez In the meantime the new problem that you have created with Algeria who will solve it Are the Algerian pateras going to increase that will reach the Balearics or the coasts of Levante or are we going to pay for it with the Algerian gas we need To begin with Algeria has suspended irregular repatriations from Spain and flights from Iberia Congratulations Mr. Sanchez On the other hand ladies and gentlemen of the People 's Party with all due consideration and respect we encourage you to resolve your internal debates as soon as possible we hope that this very weekend and to convey to the Spaniards a unique position on this and all the others because it does not help the work of the opposition that is not clear who marks the opposition on this issue if Mrs Gamarra marks it in this Parliament Mr Feijóo from the Galician Council Mr Vivas from Ceuta applauding Mr Sánchez and joining the thesis of this Government or Mr Donald Tusk from Brussels As you know and I believe that in that we will agree and we will be able to agree even more in the future Spain is in the worst hands at the worst time and it is the job of the opposition to create a viable and efficient alternative Ladies and gentlemen this government of arbitrary and clandestine actions has again led Spain to a dramatic situation Worst government at the worst time We said we had to change course we have been demanding it for four years and warning him in this rostrum The energy crisis and hyperinflation which Mr Sánchez blamed on Putin 's criminal war were already here before the war Mr Sánchez From 0 to 7 before the war Inflation was already growing by its policies it is not shielded it is not hidden We are already at 9.8 inflation that is we are 10 poorer than a year ago and this rise is caused by you as we had warned by the submission of all of you in this House to climate fanaticism and by the renunciation of all of you to energy sovereignty food sovereignty and industrial sovereignty That is to say by renouncing to explore our energy resources by renouncing to sow our fields and by renouncing to manufacture our products When they brought that climate law to this House in May last year a climate law that imposed on Spain their Paris agreements only VOX voted against only VOX voted against only VOX is innocent of the economic consequences of that climate law At that time the price on the daily electricity market was EUR 79 per megawatt hour at the beginning of this month we had reached EUR 700 per megawatt hour Mr Sánchez By the way you have come here to roar for unity unity to sink into disaster when not even your government is united and when you bargain with the enemies of unity Let 's not talk about it We do n't believe him It is not sincere when it calls for unity in this House You 're an autocrat You want to do what you want on the sidelines of this House on the sidelines of your party because you 're worth it And why did that happen with the climate law passed by this House Basically because that climate law the international agreements that inspire it and the European Green Pact are aimed at reducing our energy production capacity and increasing our dependence on third countries often hostile or unstable countries And he comes here and says there 's no turning back on the green agenda and mixes the green agenda with energy autonomy It 's impossible Mr. Sanchez What you say is impossible It 's a lie like most of the things he says in this rostrum There 's no turning back he says You are telling the Spaniards that there is no turning back in the ruin and misery to which they have been condemned with the vote in this House Since its entry into force the Act provides that no new authorizations for the exploration investigation or exploitation of hydrocarbons shall be granted on national territory That is neither coal nor oil nor natural gas With this law this House voted for the suicide of Spain in a gigantic act of betrayal of the Spaniards which has led to the destruction of our well being and to the generation of poverty ladies and gentlemen Not only in energy but also in industry as we have seen for example with regard to medicines during the epidemic but also in the primary sector You have made the Spaniards depend on unstable countries and hostile countries for the most basic goods for light for gas for bread for medicine and all that while increasing the artificial costs of CO2 emissions How is it possible that given the shortage of maize and oil we have to ask permission not to know who in Brussels so that our farmers can sow Who in his right mind in this House does that seem acceptable to Is anyone in this House aware of the level of dependence that Spain has been condemned to Is anyone aware of what that means for our compatriots in their day to day lives How is it possible that Spanish energy companies are closing or flying thermal power stations when the Spanish pass cold because they can't turn on the heating because they can't pay for the receipt Is there anyone who does n't scandalize this situation have to read constantly news These are from the month of March Green light to the pass before the closing of the central of Endesa in As Pontes Diario Palentino Iberdrola will fly on 31 the chimney of Group 1 of the thermal Deindustrialization of Spain Naturg And receives the last authorization to dismantle the Narcea thermal plant Right now You 're still busy Mr Sánchez gentlemen of the Socialist Party let us ask you again to whom are you loyal In the name of climate fanaticism they have imposed misery and dependence Extract our gas No no Bring him from the U.S. on metanerous ships that contaminate Yeah Coal centers in Spain No you have to dynamite them and let everyone see it so that they see how ecologists we are but buy electricity produced with coal from Morocco yes because we must have a different atmosphere than that of Morocco despite the dust of the Sahara that we have just received these weeks Nuclear power stations in Spain No thank you Buying nuclear power from France Yes of course And the same with the mines with the fracking with the industry and with the plastic When it comes to creating work and future for Spain your answer is no but if it is the big funds or foreign powers that make business you can say yes His is not ecology his is ignorance folly or betrayal Who do you serve Because we only owe ourselves to the Spaniards that 's why we talk about sovereignty ladies and gentlemen We are talking about sovereignty that is the ability to decide our present and to choose our future That is what you have renounced and the consequences are paid not you but all the Spaniards And when we say energy sovereignty we do not mean self sufficiency which by the way is an acceptable credible and feasible goal in the medium and long term we mean the ability to decide what we invest in what we explore in our natural resources to reduce our dependence to increase supply and to lower prices and that the Spaniards can live better He talks a lot about Putin 's criminal war Have n't you learned anything from the war in Ukraine Do n't you understand that we can't depend on hostile or unstable countries We now depend on Algeria 's gas and Algeria withdraws us from the ambassador and blocks repatriations Do they not realize that the European countries are already rectifying opting for traditional energy production formulas because they want to regain that energy sovereignty Are you going to be the last to abandon the climate fanaticism that has brought us to ruin and that threatens the Spanish with misery Mr Sánchez as far as everything that tells us today is concerned I told you at first I have to tell you that you act like a professional fraudster Presenting now some gruesome accounts some triumphs theoreticians who only see their subsidized press but who do not see them the Spaniards and pretending that the debate revolves around the patches for the punctures you have caused is something that we are not going to accept If you can lower one more point if you can subsidize one cent more To pretend to entertain ourselves without discussing the causes that have brought us here is something that we are not going to contribute to You claim that in order to be exempt from liability but the Spanish people are not going to be fooled by their deceptions ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party Self employed merchants students pensioners families all Spaniards want a serious debate in this House about the policies that have caused ruin and about the policies that can solve our problems It has not been a natural catastrophe which exists neither an epidemic nor a war No more tricks and traps Do n't hide do n't shirk your responsibilities It has basically been the climate laws that have brought us here It has been his submission to foreign interests that has turned Spain into a deindustrialized moor it has been his lack of judgment that is causing the southern border to stagger and it has been his pacts with the enemies of Spain of national unity of the constitutional order that which you also tread according to the Constitutional Court that are leading the Spaniards to misery and insecurity Mr. Sanchez stop throwing balloons out The root cause is a government built from the beginning with all the enemies of unity with all the enemies of equality and with all the enemies of the well being of the Spaniards I conclude Mr Sánchez I know you will be happy The Spaniards have run out of patience and that 's why you can't go out on the street Transporters ruined by their policies refuse to work by losing money in every port and refuse to be criminalized and insulted as they do with the opposition Who can blame them for not going to work if they lose money You can blame him you can blame him Mr Feijóo who had the occurrence of trying to replace them with the military In the meantime you gentlemen of the government lords of the sinister lords of separatism and lords of coup who are the only ones responsible follow your own with your dearest ideological obsessions such as gender as the ministry of Mrs Montero as separatism itself which has been dear to Spain as the criminalization of the countryside livestock and agriculture or its climatic laws or as the criminalization of the diesel and the vehicle industry in Spain

#SantiagoAbascalConde,Thank you very much Madam President Mr Minister Counsellor of the Embassy of Ukraine Mr Dmytro Matiuschenko is at home and apart from the parliamentary debate that you will see here today you have no doubt that we are with your Government and with your people Mr Sánchez everything you have said in this rostrum is absolutely irrelevant Look at how much it is that much of your speech has been constant appeals to unity to all kinds of units in all areas but you have not been an example of unity because even a part of your Government has refused to applaud you A nation 's foreign policy needs to be credible it needs to be reliable and it needs to be respectable You are not credible your own voters know this who you lied to during the past elections and who you betrayed 24 hours after completing the elections in breach of your promises and commitments You are unreliable because your government partners are against our international commitments And you are not respectable as president because you sit on that chair thanks to the votes of the enemies of our sovereignty of our unity and of the constitutional order You Mr Sánchez are not qualified to lead Spain At this serious moment in our history and that manifest inability translates into ruin and insecurity for the Spaniards Mr Putin is guilty of a very serious violation of international law and is guilty of a war that already threatens us and involves us all without us being able to avoid it The international community has a duty to apply the most serious sanctions to Russia for this aggression And yet what do we have here in this government in this House Mrs Lastra who is not here at the moment Mrs Montero Mrs Belarra Mr Pisarello Mr Santiago who was still clinging to your chair to refuse to applaud the sending of weapons you are all direct accomplices to this aggression by Russia against Ukraine you and the Puebla Group to which you belong I am not exaggerating you are Putin 's international allies and through your parties or the criminal organizations to which you belong like the Puebla cartel you are dedicated to hindering the world 's response to Putin Podemos who has been repeating since 2014 that Ukrainian governments are neo -Nazis as Russian propaganda literally says He did so yesterday until four days ago Vice President which I believe still has a lot of influence and a lot of command in this government which has protested because it arms the civilian population when he recently said that an unarmed people is a slave people They do it United Left and Bildu who voted against Ukraine in the European Parliament yesterday This is done by the Puebla Group to which you belong which is here in this Chamber and in this Government calling for no sanctions to be imposed And their parties do protesting right now against the Atlantic Alliance Mr Sánchez all those Putin allies I have just appointed are in your government or they support your government and therefore you and your government are unreliable not credible and not respectable And I regret to inform you Mr Sánchez that this is not just my opinion because I am aware that this mistrust of you has already taken place in several European chancelleries and that is a humiliation that Spain cannot afford You are so used to giving cat for hare to your voters and to us in this House too that you think our European partners are going to admit their magic tricks and their fireworks But that 's why you are no longer invited or put on the phone or thanked for the calls and your international summits for thirty seconds On the confusion of the shipment of weapons to Ukraine which you have not clarified today but have rectified in this rostrum I must say that you have not applauded him or his Vice President of the Government I do n't think that 's very reassuring for our international partners Also at the end of their speech they showed a unity so great that some clapping standing others clapping sitting and others clinging to the armchair without clapping Mr. Sánchez your partners do n't want me to send weapons to Ukraine 's resistance They want us to just send helmets and tirites and tell the Ukrainians to hold the chaparron Your government wants to be and is in two places at once with the aggressors and the aggressors with Putin and with NATO and that is not possible Mr Sánchez Today this Congress should give unanimous support to a President of the Government capable of defending our interests our alliances and our security but that President is not you That being said it is absolutely clear who is responsible for this very serious situation Vladimir Putin And who are the accomplices Some unfortunately and to our great shame are in this Government and in this Chamber But in addition to being guilty there are responsible and Europeans must think about it Putin would never have dared to unleash this criminal war if it were not for the European Commission driven by the two major European parties popular and socialist to leave our continent for a long time in a state of absolute vulnerability and economic and energy dependence The COVID the coronavirus epidemic caught us debating pyrops and gender sensitive mathematics and now the invasion of Ukraine has caught European bureaucrats trying to destabilize the Polish government by defending its borders Mr González Pons of the People 's Party who now threatens to return to national politics when our Polish allies face the avalanche of immigrants launched by a puppet from Putin Belarus travelled to Warsaw not as a member of his party but to the head of a European delegation with the declared intention of the media to combat the Polish Government Putin could n't be more favored Almost all of you in this House have systematically criminalized Poland week after week but it is the nation that has dared the most to warn about Putin 's threat which has faced him the most and which is now setting an example not only by supporting Ukraine unreservedly but also by hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees For these are refugees of war these women children and the elderly must be welcomed into Europe Anyone can now fully understand the difference between these current refugee flows and the invasions of young men of Muslim military and origin who have been launched against different borders of Europe in an attempt to destabilise and colonize it And anyone can now understand the position of VOX and the Polish Government We must defend our borders we must defend our sovereignty and we must defend our nations But for that we must have sufficient military capacity sufficient energy and sufficient industry to guarantee our freedom and independence that is quite the opposite of what you almost all have been promoting for decades in the name of goodism climate religion stupid pacifism or any other suicidal ideology that has put Europe in the hands of Russian gas the Chinese industry and the oil of Islamist theocracies So yes all of you are responsible for placing Europe and Ukraine in weakness You Mr. Sánchez said that the Ministry of Defence should be abolished Do you remember or do n't you remember You gentlemen of the People 's Party although I am pleased with the criticism made to the Chinese Government by Mrs Gamarra still have an agreement of friendship and collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party I do not think it is in favour of national industry our sovereignty democracy or human rights And you lords of the extreme left and separatism have joyfully received the Russian support that was pleased to promote your criminal intentions against our Constitution and against our national unity That said not everything was going to be negative It seems that Europe is suddenly waking up We have seen a historic change in German politics which suddenly calls for rearmament and even nuclear energy starring the very social democrats who have brought us through this cliff For at least a while it seems that the globalist deviations the gender obsession discussed at the last NATO summit and the dogmas of climate religion will be parked Now they know in France Germany and Italy that we need to re-energize our energy capacity including nuclear and even thermal energy There is nothing more to see about energy programmes at the moment in France Germany and Italy while here we shut down nuclear power plants and blow up the thermal power plants Now yes they know that we must strengthen our armies we know it all of a sudden Now yes they know that our security our health and it is important to say so our well being cannot depend on totalitarian communist or Islamist regimes or simply on satraps like Putin But you Mr. Sánchez do not seem willing to wake up from the progressive sleep It intends to continue a course that has been discredited by reality and history and that is a problem because you still have a great capacity but a great ability to harm Spain We have to change course We must understand and adapt to the new realities that make up the world today Only a month ago we celebrated the Madrid Summit Mr Sánchez not what you are going to celebrate within how much which was attended by prime ministers and representatives of more than ten European countries and I encourage them to read the document and thus move away from their lies and traps which we subscribe to rejecting Putin 's threats declaring the need to defend our borders and the commitment to fight to regain Europe 's energy and industrial capacity That 's the way and there 's no other You may all delay it more or less but it will end up giving us reason have no doubt And there were already some glimpses in your speech Mr. Sánchez The defence budget must be raised as much as necessary At 2 he said Germany will arrive Perhaps more so because part of our territory like Ukraine is not under NATO protection NATO must be required to put under its cover and umbrella the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla by the way a request that you of all parties have rejected in Congress and in the Senate for the last few weeks just because you had asked for VOX We must firmly defend our borders and dismantle all the official and subsidized plots of human trafficking that promote invasion and mass immigration to destabilize nations and we must abandon to see if they do so soon any anti-national agenda such as 2030 or 2050 that limits our industrial production capacity or our energy production capacity also recovering the nuclear programme And now we must urgently support Ukraine with all our means with all conviction with all the necessary strength with the economic and military means that are precise defensive and offensive and with the most severe sanctions for Putin 's criminal aggression But sincerely Mr Sánchez we believe that you cannot do this because your allies do not allow it and because you in Europe do not believe it because you in Europe do not give anything to it because neither in Europe nor in the world respect it nor your Government applauds it Allow a new course for Spain and for the Spaniards Dismiss Mr.

#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,"Ladies and gentlemen the world is changing the current geopolitical landscape is defined by uncertainty and strategic competition for power With the Russian invasion of Ukraine Fukuyama 's thesis on the end of history has again been refuted history has not come to an end Today more than ever Spain has to awaken and establish a budget for the Armed Forces that will enable them to carry out their mission It is often said and it is true that there is a lack of defence culture in Spain In recent decades politicians and the media have tried to redefine the role of our Armed Forces towards something like an NGO in uniform a forces always in missions called peace hiding the real dangers they assume in war zones and diminishing their ability to respond in situations of risk due to a misunderstanding of pacifism Of course our soldiers sailors and airmen will always be there to help in the face of natural or provoked disasters and of course they help to reduce tension in war zones but let us not forget their main mission enshrined in article 8 of the Constitution to guarantee the sovereignty and independence of Spain to defend its territorial integrity and the constitutional order This high mission requires sufficient budgetary resources to carry it out with full guarantees so we ask that on the eve of the NATO summit to be held in our country Spain take on the commitment made with our allies and raise up to 2 of the gross domestic product expenditure or investment in defence In absolute terms Spain devotes less than 1.1 of its gross domestic product Spain invests in defence only 258 dollars per capita a figure that contrasts with the 410 of Italy 709 of France or 781 of the United Kingdom According to the Atlantic Alliance Spain occupies the penultimate place penultimate 28 of 29 of NATO member countries in this area We only have Luxembourg behind us Ladies and gentlemen with a gross domestic product of just over EUR 1 million Spain should be investing twice as much in defence as is envisaged in the current budget thus reaching just over EUR 20 billion and being able to meet our international commitments It would be enough to invest in defence as much as we spend on gender equality policies The benefits of defence investment are multiple and generate a virtuous circle experienced in many countries Anyone who has known the world of technology tangentially will know that it owes multiple advances to the demand generated by a customer who consumes technology in a regular way such as the military industry Miniaturization space exploration electronics telecommunications satellite use mobile telephony the Internet drones research in areas such as biomedicine biology chemistry and so many others would be much poorer or perhaps there would not even exist in some cases if it were not for its defence application which would then move to the civil world Indeed investing in defense generates virtuous circles promotes technological advances and increases progress by generating wealth Within the necessary increase in the defence budget we have to start with a better remuneration for our troops and that is what the VOX Parliamentary Group is trying to correct today with this initiative a proposal for a law that establishes a single professional regime for professional military personnel that settles a debt of justice with those who dedicate the best years of their lives precisely to ensuring our own and that shields our commitment to national defence in the only way possible with the sufficient financial resources recorded annually in the general budgets of the State Ladies and gentlemen the excessive temporality of the Armed Forces is not explained by itself it is a problem caused by politicians With all due respect ladies and gentlemen of the PSOE and the PP you have abandoned them Twenty six years have passed since the beginning of the process of professionalization of the Armed Forces and twenty one years since the end of compulsory military service Since then our soldiers have been condemned to an absolutely unfair job insecurity low wages much lower than those of the countries in our environment and far below the rest of the administration 's workers systematic indebtedness and the chaining of temporary contracts and early exit from work until they are dispensed with without just an alternative Ladies and gentlemen for a duty of gratitude for justice but also for efficiency we must turn the military career into an attractive option for our young people I take this opportunity to greet the Union Association of Troop Military UMT which is accompanying us today in the Chamber Our national defense requires that we establish a system aimed at attracting cultivating and retaining talent throughout a professional life We played a lot on it That is why VOX registered in October 2020 a proposal regarding the salary matching of the Armed Forces with State security forces and bodies In the words of an ancient JEMAD that a combat pilot wins at least the same as the civilian guard who guards access to the base That VOX initiative succeeded in passing this House but unfortunately it has not been carried out and that is why today we are presenting this bill which if it goes ahead would put an end to the unjust situation of precariousness suffered by our soldiers Ladies and gentlemen throughout the public administration the general administration of the state autonomous communities and local authorities there is no single case of two different laws regulating the same profession This is precisely what is happening today with our Armed Forces On the one hand there are officers and all non-commissioned officers career soldiers with a stable and permanent service relationship and on the other hand the troop scale subject to the renewal of their commitment to the limit initially set at 35 years of age and extended thereafter to 45 years By reaching that age the military who have dedicated the best years of their life to Spain are no longer serving are no longer worth it They are soldiers who have served with pride Many have family burdens are fully trained and have extensive experience but at a time of their career as important as this an absurd bureaucratic design decree that no longer has to take into account their professional value They are not worth we are told and at the same time they are offered to be integrated into a reserve of special availability in exchange for their and their families complying with a grant of just over 600 euros 640 to be precise And the Ministry of Defence is resorting to temporary contracts to cover basic and ordinary needs of our Armed Forces and that is an unacceptable abuse that cannot be supported on budgetary grounds The abulia shown by governments of different signs in recent years towards our Armed Forces has a dire consequence if no one remedys it 53,000 military personnel sadly will go on to thicken the queues of unemployment Ladies and gentlemen the problem of age in the Armed Forces is not new and we are very aware that it is not an easy problem either It is well known that military life is necessarily shorter than ordinary work even for the cadres of command Not in vain the licensing of veterans has historically been the main problem of professional armies It is therefore appropriate to encourage a certain voluntary drainage of the contingent to help maintain a reasonable average age for service in units but it is also necessary to find ways to retain those who while serving satisfactorily wish to remain in positions destinations and conditions of service more suitable for their age preparation and experience Unfortunately this has not been done Conversely the system has made temporality an essential intrinsic almost structural feature of the defence model In the face of the foolishness of 35 year old graduates the PSOE government thought so let 's postpone ten years kick forward and let 's leave it in 45 But that only meant postponing ten years more the effects of a staff regime that was simply ill founded Therefore the present proposal for a law is intended to repeal Law 8/2006 and establish a common regime for the categories official non-official troop and navy with the criterion that the service relationship of all professional military personnel is substantially the same and is regulated by the same law For the entrance of soldiers and sailors is established a single temporary commitment of three years a stage of training and professional practice aimed at obtaining the title of middle level technician through a methodology of dual vocational training Upon completion of the conditions a permanent service relationship identical to that of the command tables would be accessed Ladies and gentlemen let 's do this We cannot deny the financial cost that the alternative we present today entails but it is a duty of justice it is a duty of gratitude to those who play their lives for us and above all it represents an imperative necessity We have armed forces that enjoy enormous internationally endorsed prestige and forged mission to mission worldwide That is why we need to adopt this bill today but it is despite and not because of the budgetary effort to provide them with the means they deserve For too long too much the lack of means has condemned our military to have to carry out their activities in a precarious way and that is a threat to their life and to ours Serving Spain honoring it defending it with one 's own life if necessary is the vocation of those who voluntarily decide to join our Armed Forces They carry out a great public service a service that transcends them and with it they guarantee to their compatriots peace security and ultimately freedom The Spaniards owe them a lot Many of them more than a hundred in recent years have even given their lives for Spain and for all of us We remember them every year on the Day of Hispanicity and in castrense acts For the country to die was their destiny to love Spain their eternal passion to serve in the armies their vocation and otherwise They did n't want to serve another Flag they did n't want to walk another way they did n't know how to die otherwise Ladies and gentlemen we can treat them differently and it is the best tribute that we can offer to our military from this House Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,43.001278,17.024508,22,"ladies gentlemen world changing current

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much I support on behalf of Spain 's third political force for the moment an amendment to the whole with an alternative text an amendment incorporating point k of article 39 of the Criminal Code for something that should be logical in any legislation which is simply that anyone who attacks the nation if not a national of origin loses his nationality because Spanish nationality is a right and is a privilege and cannot be granted to those who attack that unity Last week several of the parties who openly defend in this House the permanent attack on national unity who advocate permanently for the breaking of the coexistence between the Spaniards the most absolute contempt for the Constitution applauded euphoric when I announced that proposal I 'm telling you you do n't need to be applauded Stop wasting your time You do n't have to spend as much effort on your longing independence as you call it It is very simple give up Spanish nationality take a plane and leave It 's very easy they have it very easy Mr. Rufián it 's very easy Have the courage to renounce Spanish nationality ask for nationality in North Korea Cuba or Venezuela Take a plane get out of here and leave us alone because if there 's something the Spaniards can't bear it 's the hard face and hypocrisy of those who are here paying a salary and are undermining and breaking national sovereignty from within the institutions to get subsidies money for their chiringuitos and continue advertising hate and separatist lies Give up Spanish nationality be brave If you hate Spain so much the Spaniards their history and their institutions you renounce Spanish nationality but yes you must leave without taking a single apex of what belongs to us all not one centimeter of our land and our soil not one of our rights not one of our institutions We also propose in this amendment to include in its entirety subparagraph c to article 432 of the Criminal Code in order to further strengthen the crime of embezzlement which some probably for their Andalusian interests are already trying to reform until they leave it in the water of drunkards Because in the end what do we say It is very simple and it is also very logical in any legislation that anyone who allocates funds or resources for purposes that are contrary to the Constitution itself in order to violate national unity and the rights of all Spaniards must be convicted of an offence of embezzlement and in addition that offence and penalties must be reinforced if they are public office The third issue that we add in this amendment to the whole a new article 484 bis so that in everything that is considered a crime against national unity when those who engage in it are officials authorities or part of any government of the nation or work closely as happened in 2017 with some foreign nations or with foreign organizations the penalty is increased to twenty years of imprisonment and twenty years of disqualification and of course that those who do not have nationality of origin lose Spanish nationality Similarly we propose the addition of points 2 and 3 in article 543 of the Criminal Code so that anyone who commits outrages and offenses against the Spanish nation with an obvious and clear objective of encouraging protecting or exalting terrorists or the purposes of terrorists violating the Constitution or carrying out coup movements against the unity of Spain are sentenced to up to two years imprisonment and disqualification Fifth With regard to the crime of sedition that this Government wishes to repeal Increase the penalties to a maximum of fifteen years because we all know and I repeated it in this very rostrum last week what is the reason why this crime is being repealed It is an absolutely well known reason for the vast majority of Spaniards It has a direct relationship first of all with the approval of the budgets and lastly with this pact against everything that Spain represents against all the constitutional or criminal defence mechanisms that Spain has In the end we said it is to encourage the fugitives to return the convicts to be able to see their disqualification penalty reduced and that in the end that effect called the effect called in this case the coup d'état is a reality because the less defence mechanisms the State has the easier it is for those who want to destroy I would like to appeal from this rostrum as some fellow Members of my group have already done to a fundamental right of all Spaniards but especially of those who have the status of representatives of national sovereignty I would like to appeal to the right to freedom of expression enshrined in article 20.1 of the Constitution the right to be able to express freely any thought idea or opinion in word or in writing It seems incredible that we have to raise our voice in this Parliament but it is better to do so now than to regret one day for turning us into the Cuban Venezuelan assembly We prefer to do so now that we are still in time for the Spaniards to react so that as soon as possible we leave the Moncloa to whom he has openly decided to hand over Spain on a tray to those who openly decide its destruction We have been called upon by the presidency of this House over and over again to respect the Rules of Procedure For we who are the first to respect the laws and the Constitution the first to demand their compliance before the courts in the media and in the streets say that in order to respect this regulation which we do every day we must be prepared to respect the rule on which the Rules of this House are based which is nothing other than the Constitution And if the Constitution is respected no one can be protected against the foundation of the Constitution which is according to article 2 the Spanish nation the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation the common and indivisible homeland of the Spaniards And because the nation is before and because historical institutions laws constitutions customs our territory our different forms of state throughout history are before this Constitution the Constitution has no value if its foundation which is the nation is despised or attacked And if we attack the nation we attack national sovereignty which belongs to all Spaniards Therefore from this rostrum in exercise of that fundamental right to freedom of expression in no respect for the Rules of Procedure of this House in no respect for the Constitution but above all in no respect for the nation on which it is based we say that whoever attacks the unity of Spain who despises the historical coexistence of the Spaniards and who does so from the institutions is a couplist Whoever defends defends or exalts the murderers of the terrorist gangs is either a flootera or a protera or if I 'm in a hurry a very long time ago And there will be those who are upset but they will not change the meaning of things even if some want to erase in their censorship the whole dictionary because freedom consists precisely in being able to say here in the House of National Sovereignty what millions of Spaniards think and say on the street that we want clean institutions of parties that openly by action or by omission are favoring and driving the destruction of the Spanish nation that we want free institutions of those who use public funds misappropriating them for the objectives of exalting terrorism or destroying the nation that we want loyal institutions with the Spanish loyal with the Constitution loyal with the rule of law and compliant with the law that we want in short institutions where the Spanish are defended where Spain is defended and where freedom is defended And until we do we will continue to fight in this House some like it or not in the courts in the streets in the media and where we are being fought because we have neither come to kneel before the separatists nor to be afraid of the florets let alone those who defend and tolerate them Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,42.656834,12.61832,22,thank much support behalf spain 's third political force moment amendment whole

#MaríaTeresaLópezÁlvarez,Thank you President Spanish this government has sold the soul of Spain to the enemy Good afternoon Mr. Marlaska how evil you are leaving everything in your pact with those who have no homeland no flag no values How bad they 're leaving everything in their pact with the disloyals to Spain This is a government that has given everything above and beyond the interests of the Spaniards above and beyond the unity of Spain to carry out its accounts The last act of extreme disloyalty surrender to eliminate the crime of sedition by camouflageing pardons to thugs And this after even trampling the memory in their rows of ETA assassins to stay in power You 've got to be too treacherous to betray even your own Your stand here today is the stand of the villains because you are recidivists in high treason to the state for now favoring coupsmen who threaten to rise again One cannot expect anything else from those who do not know loyalty to a flag the only one that welcomes all Spaniards and by which so many Spaniards have given their lives They do not know the nobility of the earth that they tread they do not know what attachment to the roots is They do not know what loyalty and loyalty to belong to a great nation Spain Because you get up here but you do n't tell the reality of your accounts to the Spaniards They talk about the welfare state when they refer only to their own they talk about great energy transformations but they prevent them from warming their homes They are put in blood Agenda 2030 and historical memory the one that wants to rewrite ETA without dissolving or condemning its hundreds of murders They do not tell you the real reason why you now repeal the decision of our Penal Code when it is the price that Esquerra assigns to your budgets to pardon your thugs right Minister of the Interior And the reality is that since you took over the interior reins the Basque Country has already transferred the powers to prisons The reality is that Interior has approached more than 360 floors In Basque prisons it has granted about thirty third degrees and the Basque Government has also granted thirty third degrees to mass murderers Because the reality is that the goal is to grant them semi-freedom and amnesty Say it do n't be a coward Mr Marlaska tell the Spaniards that that was the contract that was and is the transaction for a few more days in your chair And we are in the debate on Volume VI Section 16 Ministry of the Interior State question security of Spain and the Spanish It increased by 11 Is that Mr Marlaska your great commitment to the defence of our borders your great commitment to the fight against terrorism to the fight against drug trafficking to the fight against crime to strengthening with personnel and material means our State security forces and bodies on all these issues an 11 increase What a shame That 's right this government exponentially increases its share of immigration by 750 million euros increases the share to what they call equality by more than 570 million euros but Interior It has an increase of 11 basically intended for the energy transition of the General Administration of the State to which you have devoted most of your speech Therefore the question is as follows Our borders are being attacked not by hundreds but by thousands of immigrants since you arrived in the government and what have you done to protect the Spaniards from this invasion For the Minister of the Interior has dedicated himself to changing concertinas for inverted penalties and leaves some areas of the fence of Ceuta and Melilla without any kind of protection neither one thing nor the other It has not increased the staff of the Civil Guard or the National Police on either of the two borders of Spain of Europe with Morocco they have not reinforced them in protective material or in material means they have vehicles for scrap and barracks and police stations that fall to pieces in many places of Spain but you continue to suck from Agenda 2030 until we talk about security in our streets They have neighborhoods in Catalonia as is the case with La Florida in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat or areas that are already ghetto some neighborhoods of Santa Coloma de Gramanet that are very close to being fully controlled by the most radicalized Islam And in Ceuta there is El Príncipe and in Melilla La Cañada for example which are no zones in power where a State has been established within the State where Muslim immigrants have installed their customs their norms their culture where the police cannot enter minister Barrios where the police and the Civil Guard are stoned because the goal is to install Islamic law Shariah And you meanwhile your government you continue to suck Agenda 2030 open door policies and multiculturalism And if we 're talking about prison institutions there 's nothing about increasing investment to give their officials more material nothing new in their security And meanwhile they keep waiting for you to be able to push him that you promised them to make them agents of authority And here in addition to the fall of Agenda 2030 fall of political criteria in the granting of third degrees and transfers of terrorists to the Basque Country In short we are faced with budgets that are the budgets of the high treason of the Government the budgets of ideological corruption of the submission to blackmail and of political concessions in a question of unquestionable relevance such as public security where gender ideology climate phobia the promotion of mass immigration uncontrolled and that only causes chaos have more weight than the security of the Spaniards when what the Spaniards need is more equality yes among the Spaniards who see for example how depending on where they live they have more or less quality in education or health or who may or may not speak in Spanish which is the official language of the State What the Spaniards need is more security and defense yes on our streets and our borders What the Spaniards need are not pacts with separatist phylotterrorists and couplists but more unity of Spain minister and less Agenda 2030 less murderous and poisonous snakes less multiculturalism and more identity,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,44.481144,14.235188,22,thank president spanish government sold soul spain

#MaríaTeresaLópezÁlvarez,"Thank you President Thank you President for appearing once again in this House although the truth is that you do not rent your winnings because it does n't matter what you come to talk about and what you come to propose because you always get the same from the right a rosary of disqualifications and not a single proposal In fact this very morning he said he was also listening to the insults of this bench No wonder because one is the only thing he does because it 's the only thing he knows how to do insult disqualify and scream Anti-politics That 's right all very moderate all very constructive High level high altitude policy for times of difficulty The more unity is needed the more efforts are needed the more important the political cohesion of our country in order to face a crisis the worse it is not that the right is not is that it is not even expected I know that they are having a hard time because it is very hard to assume that the policies the answers that are being given to the crisis in the European Union and in Spain in essence are an amendment to the whole of everything that they imposed on us in the previous crisis The president has started speaking for Europe Let 's talk about Europe In the previous crisis politics in Europe was dictated by black men who imposed on us all the commandments of neoliberal catechism that you so much applaud It came to be called austereicide And the invisible hands of Adam Smith who have names and surnames played with the lives of millions of people and left entire countries especially the countries of southern Europe to their fate Fortunately we have moved from neoliberal catechism to the social democratic exit And I can proudly say even with pride of country that virtually all the policies that the European Union is defending in order to deal with the crisis have been put on the table by our President Pedro Sánchez Because if more than EUR 700 billion is allocated in Europe today so that member countries can help their citizens and transform their economies it is because Pedro Sánchez has been calling for a new European Marshall Plan from the minute on The PP went to Brussels to boycott and ask that the funds not reach Spain It was Pedro Sánchez who proposed to take the gas price on the electric bill and got the Iberian exception And that is what Europe wants to do today everywhere except the People 's Party which says that if they rule in Spain they would take it away Pedro Sánchez was the one who talked about intervening in the energy market and that is what is being studied at the moment but to Mr Feijóo this seems to be a Stalinist measure It was the President who proposed a temporary tax on big fortunes and big companies and that is what the European Central Bank and just yesterday the International Monetary Fund said Dangerous Communists But this the leader of the opposition seems to him to be killing his rich friends Even when the contingency plan was proposed to save energy that today corrected and increased is the one that exists in all European countries you said that of Madrid does not go out in a statement of your solidarity with the whole of Spain and Europe That 's what they do with everything In short policies in the European Union today are defined by the leadership of Pedro Sánchez The People 's Party has been left alone in Europe today and has simply done the ridiculous thing which is just what is not to be done in politics as Tarradellas said But here in Spain there is more of the same Let 's compare In the 2008 crisis the PP Government cut welfare public services and 8 billion more in social policies by 27.3 billion When unemployment increased benefits and unemployment benefits were cut by more than 15 leaving those who had lost everything helpless He made a labor reform that reduced dismissal and of course he got fired and that with garbage contracts with wages of misery he got seven million working women and poor workers in Spain Pensions rose by 0.25 and while the pensioners lost purchasing power one year yes and another year more than €60 billion was emptied that left the evil government of Zapatero in the Social Security hut He cut scholarships in research in investments But that however much they repeat the opposite now and again has raised all taxes all of them especially VAT which is the one that most affects the middle classes and the working classes He even set a sun tax and in addition increased public debt in Spain by more than EUR 500 billion In other words it cut the welfare state and public services to pieces it emptied the pension hut it lowered the wages of public employees it cut dependency social benefits until it left them in the bones it abandoned the productive economy it raised all taxes and still increased the public debt by 30 Do n't tell me you do n't have to have a special skill for this This is indeed the economic miracle of the People 's Party In the previous crisis the People 's Party cut everything it could and then gave it to the banks That 's the Spanish right save the capital and abandon everyone else What a difference and pride for progressives to have a government that radically does the opposite that implements radically different measures and policies The latest measures are contained in budgets that allocate more than EUR 275 billion to social investment to strengthen the welfare state and public services to protect citizens and to combat inequality Never in history has so much money been spent to help people in Spain But there are also more than 30 billion for the change of productive model 16,300 in R D+i 12 000 in real investments Mr Esteban I am also not going to talk about budgets because they will have their time and debate but it is clear that the big numbers tell us that these are the accounts that Spain needs by 2023 because they protect citizens middle and working classes weave the largest solidarity network ever seen for the most vulnerable help the productive economy to continue creating wealth and employment in Spain and transform the country to make it greener more digital more competitive and more self sufficient First of all what has it occurred to you to say to the right You put an alternative on the table Have you made any proposals What 's going on They have said that they are electoral budgets and that they are made to buy votes But is that really a great contribution to what Spanish society needs in times of crisis How far does your great solvency your good faith go Is that how you want to be an alternative As the Secretary General of Workers Commissions said Unai Sordo but who do you believe to consider that pensioners public employees fellows dependents the unemployed all those who benefit from these budgets are like lambs who have their vote for sale and are offered to the highest bidder But what country do they live in Maybe they 're too used to buying wills with envelopes and that 's how it goes By the way I have to repeat something that the President of the Government has already said and that they are not going to like anything all this is going to be financed with European funds and taxes Yes with taxes with progressive taxation that constitutional concept that you like so little and that just means the more you have to contribute And since you do n't like it you despite the blah blah blah blah where you rule have done just the opposite you have used the taxes so that those who have more have more While giving gifts to those already privileged they cut off the welfare state and public services which are the guarantee that everyone else can face a minimum of certainty and dignity in the career of life Because without public health without public education without a public pension system without social benefits there is no equal opportunity Social democracy always understood that a person cannot be free or equal if he is a slave to necessity From there emerged the welfare state after the Second World War to provide to meet the basic needs of a defeated citizenship Because yes Mr Abascal it was the social democracy that set up the welfare state and all you want to do is destroy it In addition middle classes exist because there is a welfare state because it is public resources that bear large social costs and enable middle classes to save and prosper I 'm just going to give you a piece of information so you can understand this A family in which parents have completed a career at the public university and their two children involves an investment by the State in education and health over their entire life of more or less EUR 1 300 000 Could you pay it with your taxes in your pocket For that is the real middle class financed by the solidarity taxes of all if not it would not exist That 's the middle and working class you do n't defend because you 're demolishing the welfare state that makes it possible and you do it because your bet is another your model is private insurance private schools private pension plans everything for your friends to do private business with public needs A very clear example is Madrid the community where less public money is invested in health and education but where more is spent on private health Fortunately the progressive government is the great advocate of the public and uses taxation to fight inequality redistributes resources so that it has more people who need it most and distributes the burdens so that it provides more people who have it most Tax justice to achieve social justice Because we are not going to allow the progress of a few to walk on the misery of many which is what you seek permanently And if not we see it Andalusia where they have forgiven the wealth tax to the great fortunes is on the line in health investment and the new school year has started with almost 1200 fewer classes in the educational centers and half of the places to strengthen teachers In Madrid Ayuso 's tax haven there are 37 emergency primary care services that have been closed for two years have fired more than 6000 health care workers and the course has started with 1000 places of secondary school teachers less In Galicia in Feijóo where they want to improve the 7,500 people who have a wealth of more than 6 million to pay half of what they pay now they have closed almost 150 schools cut 900 hospital beds and more than 1100 health personnel I could go on but this is the cruelty of the truth their joyful tax cuts to those who have the most are cutting off the dignity of everyone else 's lives And the question is why do you think it 's okay for them to always lose the same ones Why do sacrifices always have to fall on the same backs The answer is very simple because they are not yours Do not come to me with empty words or empty speeches the facts are there to prove what I say ERTE against labour reform against rise in the interprofessional minimum wage against increase in scholarships aids to transport and transporters bonus for rent cultural bonus against minimum living income against rise in pensions with the CPI against By the way do n't be fooled anymore by this matter because your leader Mr. Feijóo uses peripheral phrases to escape when asked about pensions But in my village it is said white and bottled You do not want to raise pensions you want to lower pensions with the excuse that they are not sustainable but say it at once They have protested against everything that has helped the citizens of this country that is they have not defended workers they have not defended pensioners young people women and families And I am not going to say that they have not defended anyone because they have defended someone they have defended the usual the privileged the powerful But the reality without laughing is here When they push the button and say temporary tax on energy and financial companies they vote against temporary tax on big fortunes against Iberian exception which has saved 10 billion consumers against sometime will bill more against the fact that corporation tax is approaching the nominal against the fact that taxation is not based exclusively on labour income It does n't matter what they count The facts show that even though they say they represent their millions of voters they do not represent and defend more than 0.2 of the country 's citizens Fortunately the Government is concerned and concerned about all others There is not a single person in Spain who has not been benefited by any measure of this Government except the friends of Mr Espinosa de los Monteros as he told us the other day The rest all of them Ladies and gentlemen this is the people 's government a government to protect and transform and a government that despite its shrieks has the backing of the social majority of this country and will continue to do

#GeorginaTríasGil,Thank you President Does Castilla wait sleep or dream The poet wonders Castile and Leon have awakened Since last Sunday the Castilanoleonese are bearers of a new hope Thanks to all those who voted for us you are brave ones we are not going to disappoint These days we talked with Mario who gets up every morning at five o'clock to milk his goats and make an exquisite artisan cheese with Libi who tells that thirty years ago there were three teachers in his village that now there is no school and that the two remaining children have to go to a village that is 20 kilometers away taken by their parents because there is no school transport either We have also spoken to farmers farmers traders workers from the few remaining factories who remain as they can and who see how their descendants do not continue what they have built with so much effort for a lifetime They and so many others are the ones who mark the change of course that we want to implement in politics and that can be valued in the motion that we are presenting today We are congratulated because the ballot boxes have shown that beyond political calculations sterile chatter and media violence a new course for Spain is possible This crystallizes in the motion that we present today a battery of measures that must be applied simultaneously with professionalism decision and creativity First in order to succeed in the fight against depopulation and to meet the demographic emergency situation that we live in we have half of the children we need for generational replacement we must renounce the postulates of the 2030 Agenda radically incompatible with the promotion of the family and the defence of the true interests of the Spaniards and their sovereignty and that indoctrines our children by confronting men and women parents against children intoxicating and incapacitating for a healthy family life This is evidenced by the fact that in all the documentation on the demographic challenge that the Government has produced there are no words such as father mother family or birth anywhere How then is a country repopulated Will he be with parents with mothers with family betting on birth and promoting the family the great absentee of his expensive twenty two ministries Ladies and gentlemen Spanish women want to have children The INE gives us a bloody figure more than 70 of Spanish women want to have more than two children and the national average is 1.2 children Why does the Government not address this very serious issue which affects something inherent in the status of women which is the illusion of being a mother It is that the People 's Party and the PSOE which have alternated in the government in recent decades instead of addressing the problem of root depopulation have managed to make rural abandonment in Spain more serious and destructive than in the countries of the environment It is that not only have they abandoned the family and the birth policies but to remain in power they have privileged some regions against others encouraging the separatism and disintegration of our nation They have failed to pursue the economic and social advancement of the regions most in need while in power Demographic growth is economic growth so we propose policies of direct and indirect support for motherhood and work reconciliation involving all administrations progressive direct support by number of children facilities for access to housing and basic supplies and tax subsidies and deductions for those with children In general the aim is to create a strong system of support for the family which brings together institutional tributory social labour bioethics and social awareness measures which places the family at the centre of public policy and also incorporates the family perspective in the drafting of laws and provisions To help show the beauty of the family to allow young people to understand that strong families make strong societies that having children is wonderful that they are a gift that they are our greatest legacy and that ultimately there is nothing comparable to the bonds that are created in a family At the same time we are also proposing taxation in favour of anyone who wants to establish himself in rural areas with very concrete measures It is also essential to promote administrative and bureaucratic simplification processes to facilitate the establishment of self employed and enterprises Do you think it is normal that not one or two but a multitude of entrepreneurs in my province have had to put their head office in Madrid because in Ávila everything is slower more difficult more expensive and with a poorly focused hypercontrol that discourages the creation of new companies And so on For young people it is necessary to promote the generation of academic professional and vital opportunities in areas at risk of depopulation as well as access to housing by providing the necessary services to promote a strong industry and in particular to protect the vertebrating role of the agri -food industry in rural areas and to strengthen the financing and provision of education facilities in rural areas in accordance with their special characteristics We also propose an increase in the quality and quantity of public services provided in rural areas particularly in the area of health and transport in particular to meet the needs of our elderly because many are dependent and need a dedication that they are not receiving there are no pediatricians or radiation therapy units and everything has always been promised Finally the current duplication excesses and inefficiencies of administrations in the fight against depopulation must be avoided For so many good Spaniards which we cannot mention today the VOX seeders will fight to return their lives to abandoned Spain with our presence with our tireless management and thus end the punishment of banishment to which so many young people are condemned because they have the right to a job a home and to create a family in the land in which they were born and not be forced to give up their roots and their

#AgustínRosetyFernándezDeCastro,"Thank you Madam President Madam Minister of Defence when following the invasion of Ukraine she appeared in the Commission our parliamentary group urged her to step up our defence effort He then replied he will remember that we will never reach 2 committed to the allies at the 2014 Wales Summit A few days later the spokesman for the Socialist Parliamentary Group said otherwise and in that they are now where I said Diego and tomorrow we do not know Let us return to what we always have this extreme left government has no defence policy and does not have it because the interests of Spain sovereignty security prosperity and even the nation itself which is what must be protected have it without care It is therefore pointless that section 14 of this draft budget for ruin is due to any rationality beyond trying to please our partners and allies and to cover the most urgent shortcomings identified by the Chief of Staff among the many that the long standing incuria has caused in the Armed Forces But now we are here to dispatch a procedure Mrs Margarita and in five minutes we will tell you why we do not agree with your accounts as much as it comes boasting of a budget increase of almost 26 25 billion euros with the scandal of your fellow communists terrorists and coupsmen who of all things are who would like to see the national state become weaker and Spain helpless The times are not for frivolities or indifference minister because the world today is very competitive A distinguished member of his department once told me that Spain could not participate in an arms race a non-small excuse but that Morocco and Algeria are the powers that in the Strait region are holding the arms race which will lead the first to equal our defence budget and the second to double it What we should be concerned about is that the geopolitical coordinates in which Spain stands have an objective risk before which it must play a relevant role as a strategic actor with its partners and allies yes but under any circumstances it must maintain military security to deal with emerging threats because the main commitment of the Armed Forces Minister is the defence of Spain itself Having said that it does not seem to us that those seven years that your government has given to reach the legendary 2 of Wales are a reasonable time That quota represents a minimum a minimum that was estimated in 2014 to be reached in ten years We are in 2022 and the war has surprised Europe two years earlier Mrs Robles the year 2029 can be too late for Spain as has been 2024 for the European Union as jealous of its strategic autonomy as it is unable to face its risks without the American presence What about our country which has been Europe 's red light in the defence effort Let 's go to the numbers It is not easy to argue clearly because your department 's accounts have been aggravating with clarity as a result of their complexity masking and uncertainty To begin with if we look at the figures for special modernisation programmes they increase to more than 38 of the department 's resources while the rest of the applications including personnel and force preparation costs increase by a modest 8.5 We 're not gonna get any better with this With regard to the major investment programmes we have already warned its Secretary of State that the multi-annual payments already committed by the Ministry of Defence according to data from the General Intervention of the State Administration amount to about 30 billion euros which together with the more than 20,000 corresponding to the new programmes total 50 billion euros This means that if similar resources were to be devoted in successive exercises the ministry would take a decade no longer seven years to meet its debts and commitments You will understand Minister that given the low reliability of these ruin budgets and what the background inspires we are concerned about this prospect In programme 122 Bravo we have seen eight reprogrammings by agreement of the Council of Ministers which have caused delays in fourteen of the twenty one programmes in implementation and difficulties in financial and industrial planning for companies in the sector Does it not seem to you that it would be necessary at least to reach that long awaited minimum quota amortizing advances to release future resources I must remind you Minister that the general budgets of the State are a formal law that must be complied with and that the investment of public funds entails the responsibility and commitment that they reach their final destination without being worth technical or financial excuses Maritime patrol aviation and submarine weapon are sad examples of loss of capabilities due to obsolescence of a material that did not come to replace in time let 's hope it does n't happen the same Close your ears separatist ladies as they say with the innumerable F 35 Alpha and Bravo for the Air Force and the Navy respectively I have extended much perhaps too much as far as large investments are concerned because as you know there is no more ineffective expenditure than investment in systems that in the absence of staffing and support do not yield results in terms of the effectiveness of the forces the reason for being and the existence of the armies and the Navy We must denounce here that due attention to military personnel and effectiveness are the two major victims of the so called major programmes The military serve Spain with loyalty and professionalism that you abuse when the guarantor of your well being is the state How busy are they in aggravating the memory of their dead that they have no time to take care of the living How do you plan to secure the future of our soldiers and sailors beyond the age of forty five When does the department leave the equalization of the salaries of military personnel with the state security forces and bodies The salary increase to officials will not close that unfair gap On the other hand we see that the number of troops involved in operational activities continues to be reduced from 76,000 in 2021 to 54,000 by 2023 What is happening to the availability of human resources With regard to support programme 122 Alfa and Mike such a slight increase cannot alleviate the effects of repeated cuts in the maintenance of systems ships and aircraft having reached a maximum of 50 coverage of needs As the availability of material although scarce is compatible with limited deployment in times of peace the deficit is masked But how can you continue to spread crediblely in the face of threats against our vital interests being so under enlistment for the action of all forces We shall vote

#VíctorManuelSánchezDelReal,Madam President ladies and gentlemen I think it was necessary in the midst of this debate on international conventions that at least one voice will be raised in defence of the interests of Spain not the interests of those who want to break Spain and bring international agreements to talk about what interests them We are talking about very serious things that affect the Spaniards You do international politics and politics for the Spaniards Let 's make politics for the Spaniards with the international conventions We are talking about three airspace agreements in three places two of them in conflict we are talking about Armenia and Ukraine reached by the European Union and which Spain has to corroborate or not It seems reasonable that we recognize that the world of 2021 has changed What was a reasonable airspace agreement at the end of last year at this time is absolute madness Does this mean that we do not have to ratify these agreements with Ukraine Armenia and other countries No but we have to draw attention to the European Union because its slowness and delay in adopting agreements lead to the adoption at this time of an airspace agreement for the hope of peace in that territory in the conflict in Ukraine Let us hope that this agreement can be approved but that it will be kept because it would be absolutely unreasonable for Spanish airlines to fly for example in that territory at this time The second part concerns the classified information agreement with Azerbaijan a direct agreement between Spain and Azerbaijan also reached last year We are talking about one more of the inheritances of social communism in the world let us not forget These conflicts that I am talking about come from the legacy of the practical application of communism and socialism in the world That 's what these conflicts come from their perverse ideas And that 's why we 're going to oppose it because it 's a conflict that also affects the Spaniards There are already many problems with the Spanish with energy with arriving at the end of the month among others in many of us this government has put us with its irresponsible international actions so that now we start to do that international policy that likes so much the left those that break Spain seeking to bring examples other countries It 's complicated what 's in Azerbaijan right now it 's complicated what 's in Armenia We have religions we have ideas and we have the heritage of republics remember that you Soviets That is the origin of this problem the application of communism and socialism There was already an agreement here between all the groups to ask for international legality and Spain does not deserve to enter into a conflict right now which moreover affects energy which is what really affects the Spaniards you are full of mouths talking about it right now A little bit of responsibility a little bit of caution a little bit of caution and a little bit of thinking about Spain and the Spanish ladies and gentlemen Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,43.531715,16.242638,22,madam president ladies gentlemen think necessary midst debate international conventions

#LuisGestosoDeMiguel,Thank you very much Franco finally showed up in the room it was late Franco I do n't know if he is but Bildu I see there Republican Left there Podemos there Communist parties there all the anti-system there all the enemies of Spain there those I do see Franco I do n't know where he is but those are all sitting there including the ETA which I see in the background First of all since it has not given a single argument nor has it overturned one of the proposals beyond saying nonsense about science and so on what brings VOX here are scientific studies they are studies presented by engineers of Caminos Canales and Ports they are preliminary projects they are serious things Here I have seen nothing but generality vagueness and genuine nonsense of cancelling the rule of law in these areas of Spain I would also like to remind all the Spanish victims of the storms and of course my best wishes of course to those in the area of the Mar Menor and Cabo de Palos because these torrential rains have exceeded the scrubbers of their municipalities which has caused a new discharge of black waters to the Mar Menor after decades without doing anything as we have proposed to them since VOX I 'm going to keep insisting In addition to the ramblas they have poured into the Sea Minor new tons of mud that fill the tail competence of the PSOE government and Podemos preventing water from entering the Mediterranean Sea for the regeneration of that unique environment that you want to collapse It is their environmental hecatombe to criminalize agriculture the worst the better to see if they touch power where they do not take a vote If we are already on the basis that man is equal in animal rights because we must not forget what is being discussed here what is this that man is equal in animal rights and that ecosystems are even above the law the rule of law and people as you say it will not be surprising that donkeys deer or some wild boar end up being mayors because if they are so equal they will also have the right to vote and to be elected in their crazy logic I 've already announced yes that VOX is only going to take people on their lists Put whatever you want in yours It is also tremendous that two parties such as Citizens and the People 's Party have shown their enthusiasm for this legislative aberration I am going to be generous and I am going to think that genuine in the face of the moral superiority of this left that in which they believe they have not even read it because it is a bestial limitation of fundamental rights in the area including private property as acknowledged by the rapporteur who intended together with restrictions on more freedoms such as business the creation of criminal types without reforming the Penal Code I do not think that your voters like it very much to support the creation of a soviet in the Minor Sea managed by an agency above the administrations and the state itself and that of the thirteen members who make up it always have the decision making majority characters like the extreme left and its head ecologists who know nothing about the Minor Sea except that we have to sovietize That 's why I say I have n't heard a single argument beyond what we 're used to as fascists etc. and bring back who we all know If I have to say in view of the fact that I have not been struck by anything I have said or denied that the totalitarian content of this ILP is the one I am denouncing here on behalf of my parliamentary group which so far has been my intervention We have made a rigorous presentation of the problem and of easy cheap and common sense solutions for the Lesser Sea He has not been able to forward our proposals to us with arguments except with his disqualifications I am already telling you that we will repeal this nonsense when we govern the next legislature along with all the laws criminalizing agriculture and all its chiringuitos that have been approved by the cowardice of the popular government of Murcia and suicidal dogmatism for Spain from all over the left We 'll restore sanity and hope because there 's only VOX left Thank you very
