#MaríaDeLaCabezaRuizSolás,Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Party with this proposal you show that your goodness has no limits and you will forgive me but neither will your hypocrisy You intend to raise the flag of the project of an association that intended to fight against loneliness with the aim that by approving this GNP unanimously in Congress we can come to the UN and ensure that the right not to be alone is considered a universal right and that it is proclaimed that all people have the right to be related to be treated with affection to feel accompanied and that this affective relationship between the equals is free bilateral direct respectful and consented We truly share that no one should be alone that no one should feel alone and that indeed we are faced with one of the most serious problems of our time But do you know ladies and gentlemen where you are most likely not to feel alone to be treated with affection to live with one another and to have that which in such a resounding and ideological way you call a relationship between the same affective free bilateral direct respectful and consenting That place is family ladies and gentlemen There is no better place to feel accompanied loved and cared for than a family in the family there is no loneliness it is in the family where one learns to love and to be loved to care and to be cared for The family is the only place where there is unconditional love and yet the family has always been the great forgotten for you That is why I say to you ladies and gentlemen that your goodness and hypocrisy have no limits because you invent new rights to hide the evil you have done by keeping families from the centre of all your policies because you do the opposite of what you say and set qualities and feelings contrary to those that you show when you talk about fighting loneliness forgetting the family You who have endeavoured to destroy the family as the basic nucleus of society who have encouraged one person households and single parent families without thinking about their future who have normalized the affective relationships of using and throwing who call us to end our days alone who have seen birth crumbling leaving our families without a future who promote abortion so that children who grow our families are not born and euthanasia as the best solution for the terminally ill who suffer loneliness you Your Honor have told us here a real story of the loneliness that these people suffer and to which you only offer a solution You who inoculate the hatred of the man making it difficult for couples you tell women who do not need anyone to be happy that it is better to come home alone and drunk that having many children is a delay you who are going to let children without a diagnosed gender disorder mutilate their bodies making them chronically ill for their whole life and their life in the chronicle of an announced loneliness because they can never have biological children you who allow children who are illegal immigrants to separate from their families to come to our country condemning them to the worst of loneliness which is the loneliness of uprooting which cuts off the affective bonds of the place where they were raised away from their own you are the ones who now come to reassure their consciences with empty declarations of intentions who will not serve anything if you remain alone in that In Spain two million elderly people live alone and more and more are found days or even weeks after they have died without anyone missing them in the indifference of an increasingly dehumanized society No one should be forced to leave their country alone No old man should end up dying alone No child or young person should come home every day from school or college and find that there is no one to ask him how he has gone And of course no one should have to give up forming a family We all need to share our time to be heard to feel that we care about someone to know that we will never be alone and we all know we all know that there is no better cure for loneliness than the family So what is the point of proclaiming a right for every need that we are unable to satisfy Why is that effort to seek so far away what we have so close to Ladies and gentlemen we do not need free bilateral direct respectful and consensual emotional relations What we need are families families in which we feel loved and accompanied families in which parents care for their children since they come into the world and in which children care for their parents until they leave surrounded by affection and respect You foster the family you support the family Make sure that families have the resources they need to care for their children their elders their sick and I assure them that we will fight loneliness much better than with the proclamation of new rights that it would not be necessary to proclaim if we put the family where it deserves which is at the heart of all our policies Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,-1.9907225,-13.087165,0
#MaríaDeLaCabezaRuizSolás,"Thank you President I can't remember what it feels like to be able to walk move your arms talk eat drink and breathe I just remember and I value that I 'm still alive I can see hear feel and just because of those simple things I 'm happy Thank you Jordi Sabate for your example of life and for representing so many who like you demonstrate every day that you are indispensable to a society that often forgets the things that really matter And it 's just that today thanks to you we 're partying in Congress Today thanks to you we make a small parenthesis between so much suffering and so much bad news to celebrate life Today we have the opportunity to take a step forward so that assisted suicide is not the only thing that those who govern us can offer to the sick of ALS to alleviate their suffering and that of their families Everything is thanks to you Jordi thanks to you and to the signatures that you collected and that have made it possible for us today to discuss this bill to guarantee the right to a life worthy of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis How sorry I am that you can't be here with us today as you wished How many barriers we still have to break down A dignified life How well these two words sound together especially after having passed in this very House a shameful law of euthanasia that despises the dignity of the lives of those suffering from a disease offering them death as the only alternative It is paradoxical that today we are witnessing how the very people who argue their support for this terrible law in the name of individual freedom are now talking about helping people with ALS live instead of helping them die The truth is that we would like to think that it is because at least they have understood that one cannot exercise his freedom to die when the only alternative offered to him is death Today we would like to think today we would like to be delighted with the possibility of dreaming that the decision to present at last this law has not been circumstantial that it is a decision of silence a decision that involves a change of mentality a change that has placed the life and dignity of the people in the center and that therefore they have now understood that resources cannot be spared to those who have the courage to fight against an incurable disease to those who refuse to throw away the towel to those who do not want to give up living to the last breath If this was happening if this really was happening it means that the struggle and the unpayable example of heroes like you Jordi Sabate and like Juan Ramón Amores JuanCarlos Unzué Toni García Francisco Luzón and so many others since anonymity have not been in vain and that today opens a door to hope not only to the sick of ALS but also to all the sick who with other different pathologies but also cruel neurodegenerative diseases and other rare diseases also need extraordinary resources to live dignifiedly and not to pose an unbearable economic burden for their families Because it cannot be that in the face of a deadly disease and a hundred per cent disability there is not enough public support It can not be that the survival time of a patient is determined by his or her economic capacity and that a well attended ALS patient with the necessary resources lives better and has more life expectancy than another who does not have them Ladies and gentlemen the average cost for ALS patients to cope with their illness is between € 40,000 and € 60,000 per year That means that the vast majority of these patients cannot face it and this circumstance is inhuman It is inhuman for someone to have to face such a test with the added anguish of not being able to have the resources to do so The same is true of other diseases of invalidants and mortals in many cases of children These people need caring staff who in advanced stages must be qualified health personnel to attend 24 hours a day These people need to adapt their homes need assistive devices articulated beds wheelchairs communication systems they need treatments and care that are essential to be able to stay alive aspiration medication and artificial feeding by gastric tube respiratory therapy not to mention the bill of light which has become a real headache for those who have to stay connected to a machine 24 hours a day It cannot be ladies and gentlemen that only those who have resources can afford to live better and longer In an advanced society the survival of the sick cannot depend on their purchasing power we can not afford it The State has an obligation to ensure with its resources the survival of those who struggle to live because there is no other cause that justifies it any more and not a single euro should be spent on anything else that is not indispensable until there is only one person who needs help to survive not a single euro while there is only one sick person who is not cared for as it deserves because a dignified death cannot be given to those who have not been given a dignified life And of course we cannot allow a single patient with ALS or any other serious illness to let go because he feels that it is an insurmountable expense for his family or a burden for those who leave everything to care for them We cannot afford to spend months until these diseases are diagnosed delaying recognition of disability dependence and incapacity for work because time in a disease with little life expectancy is the most valuable thing these people and their families have Ladies and gentlemen we must all live as a collective failure that the first victims of euthanasia in Spain have been sick of ELA because we will never know if the circumstances of having had no support from your Government conditioned the decision they took We will never know what he would have decided to have known that neither they nor their families would lack resources to live decently to the end Today it is evident that you were mistaken by precipitating your law of euthanasia that the good way was this just the one we started today that in the face of the reality of the suffering that occurs at the end of a person 's life with an incurable disease the human and the just is to do what we are doing today to help live instead of helping to die because that is what we are claiming from those who have inspired this law that we help them to live And if they do not surrender if they overlap with their tragedy if they are able to transform an evil into such a great good and give meaning to their sickness and suffering we cannot fail them They with their struggle have taught us the way today and we as politicians have an obligation to follow it because there is nothing that can make more sense of what we do Ladies and gentlemen this case deserves this bill to come forward unanimously today and our wish is that it be so and that from now on not only the sick of ALS but all those who need it have the resources to live a dignified life And I do not want to come down from this rostrum without paying a small tribute on behalf of my entire parliamentary group to all those who fight for their lives and their families for their unpayable example for teaching us with their courage how insignificant most of our problems are for making us regain faith in humanity and for showing us that life is a treasure in all circumstances that it is a gift that cannot be left unopened that it is a light that always shines and that we must put it in a place of honor so that everyone can see it Thank

#RafaelFernándezLomanaGutiérrez,President ladies and gentlemen the Republican Parliamentary Group has tabled a full amendment to the draft Sports Law adopted on 17 December 2021 by this Social Communist Government in the Council of Ministers and it does so because it considers that the draft is unconstitutional It is surprising that the ultra independenceist and republican left appeals to our Constitution which they openly deny and which they claimed only four months ago that it was delegitimized that is that the Constitution is good for them and that they use it for what they are interested in and always for their own benefit My group Mr VOX would like to express its opposition to this amendment as a whole because it is simply a return amendment and does not propose alternatives We believe that a new law on sport is necessary a modern renewed and advanced law that replaces the current one of 1990 We believe that the regulatory framework for sport needs to be updated that the sporting legal system needs to be provided with basic tools to meet the challenges of the coming decades and that there is a need for comprehensive and appropriate regulation to meet the needs of the current sport This does not mean that we share the full content of the project with which we are very critical and this is reflected in our partial amendments to its articulation but we believe in the need for a new law a law of consensus a law equal to what Spanish sport deserves that so many glories have given our Spanish nation The Republican Parliamentary Group does not offer alternatives simply because it has no interest in Spanish sport It is based on its amendment that autonomous competence in sport is invaded They even dare to include in their consideration of unconstitutional the Sectoral Conference on Sport They may not know that it has existed since 2008 under the name of the Interterritorial Conference on Sport and the role of coordination between the State and the Autonomous Communities And by the way to this day there is no complaint about such a conference by this ultra- left independentist and republican formation It is possible that the Republican Parliamentary Group does not want coordination between the State and the autonomous communities in this area which is why they have not said anything in the last fourteen years of the existence of this body In short accepting the fundamental theses of the Republican Parliamentary Group would mean recognizing that the Spanish State lacks the power to legislate in the field of sports which is what they would like but unfortunately for them this debate was closed long ago by the Constitutional Court Although there have been a number of rulings by the Constitutional Court in this area I can only cite three rulings The first of 1986 of 10 January The Constitutional Court held that the statutory attribution of exclusive competence in sport to the autonomous communities must on the one hand connect with the autonomous competences and on the other with the general interests of the Spanish sport as a whole whose defence and promotion will then be the responsibility of the State This ruling resolved precisely a conflict between the Generalitat de Catalunya and the possible Catalan federal participation in international competitions when the corresponding Spanish sports federation did not appear Here the Constitutional Court emphasized that the possible administrative intervention cannot be the responsibility of the authorities of the autonomous community since there are interests that are characteristic of the Spanish federated sport as a whole Second judgment 8/2012 of 18 April The High Court stated that even the powers which have been defined as exclusive to the autonomous communities must be exercised with respect to the powers which may fall to the State in accordance with the principle of territorial competences as something implicit in the system of autonomy itself And he added that the very polyhedral reality of sports matter in its different facets health education culture research physical education regulated professions or commercial legislation necessarily determines the concurrence of the various public administrations state autonomous and local Moreover in some cases it requires a comprehensive and non-fragmented approach because it involves actions in which the subject matter of sport is intertwined with another subject that is competently attributed to the State such as for example the special link between sport and health Finally in judgement 16/1996 of 1 February three Republicans the Constitutional Court declared that the State has jurisdiction over certain matters particularly education and culture which may also affect sport All this without prejudice to the specific powers conferred on the State by Law 10/1990 on Sport He added that the said law was adopted in order to manage the sport in accordance with the competences of the State administration and coordination with the autonomous communities and where appropriate with local corporations which could directly and manifestly affect the general interests of the sport at the national level The Constitutional Court recalled that this law was not the subject of any criticism by any autonomous community nor was its predecessor Law 13/1980 of 31 March In conclusion and with this we close our argument of opposition to the amendment to the entire Republican Group the Constitutional Court has made it more than clear that the exercise of the powers assumed as exclusive by the autonomous communities in their respective statutes of autonomy limits the exercise of the powers of the State From my parliamentary group VOX we will always propose policies of national unity because all Spaniards have the same rights and we must also have them in sport and because it is what Spanish sport needs and deserves against all those who want to divide us continuously in search of their own economic and partisan interest very proper to this social communist government and its independent and bi-dutar partners That is why we are going to say openly to this amendment as a whole No Thank you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,-6.901014,-4.880901,0

#VíctorManuelSánchezDelReal,Very good is n't it Independence plurality First of all Minister you 're a lawyer man It was on the agenda how are you talking about traps if it was on the agenda accepted by the whole House and the whole Bureau Do not cheat you are being recorded and you are a lawyer although it has already been shown that it is not extraordinarily good He 's not a good propagandist either You 're so predictable that even a fellow from the smallest of the communication agencies knows the speech you 're going to make I told you we won the bingo not the line we did the bingo twice There are nineteen times you have said far right if you add up thirty two disqualifications and without the Bureau telling you anything There she is come on Yeah yeah I told him I was going to laugh because he gave neither one argument nor one justification for independence Visits to Moncloa is that independence is that parliamentary control You say you read me Article 20 of the Constitution You follow the parliamentary sessions that go on what you are going to talk about because yesterday I was the one who spoke of Article 20.3 of the Constitution which speaks of parliamentary control Are the visits to the Moncloa parliamentary control Is it putting your hands on the board of directors and reinforcing it by royal decree not coming to this House parliamentary control That is not parliamentary control Mr. Minister of Ancient Propaganda You in your speech are so predictable that we know what you 're going to say You 've gone to the disqualification of the group By the way you said we 're 0.0 could you give me the data We are four million Spaniards who support 52 Members And you say we 're the ones with the lies Look there are now three or four deputies This is the importance that PP attaches to the control of Spanish Radiotelevision Three or four Members present here Sure If you 're willing to make a deal with yourselves If we are the only voice that tells you to stop getting your hands on what you say is independent Because you have the quail that I broke the box I repeat to say that it is independent But if you have summoned to Moncloa who is your candidate By the way the new provisional presidency for propaganda comes from one you always talk about compound surnames in my case the Del Real is from one place and the De Luna are from another place You on top of that do not even know where the socialist family names come from the socialist families are indeed of the Abolene rancio of the Abolene rancio socialist The new interim president comes from an Abolengo rancio with a service sheet from her partner high ranking PSOE the construction of a lot of prisons at the time of Felipe González We are talking about the person who dedicated himself to selling the land of the Spanish Radiotelevision entity the sale of Prado del Rey is the partner of Miguel Barroso You say we mess with private television but if you 're a public concession you 've given it to them Either they 're public concession or they 're private If you want to be private issue for example in digital only in digital But for that there is no courage because they really like to be in the mood to have a license that you the public funds that you give them through the campaigns and the funds that you receive from Spanish Television because Miguel Barroso and company and Roures and company are the ones who above do the programs that the professionals of the Spanish Radio Television house do not do Minister of Propaganda if you are going to be the Minister of Propaganda learn at least the subject which you do not know You can tell me twenty thirty or forty times I will add at the end of the session ultra ultra ultra that I say ista ista ista For these are their customs to sell the land to have their friends companions comrades brothers husbands and wives being the ones who sell and get into the coffer and end up on the boards of directors another case to finger or are the ones who make the bargain with the money of all the Spaniards Minister get your hands off Spanish Radiotelevision stop your propaganda act Because I do n't know if you 're doing propaganda to campaign for Don Pedro Sánchez who does n't know if he 's going to be a candidate but that 's where it was said to be you By the way I was delighted to see the very modern Mr Zaragoza approach you to give I understand a last minute advice to such a moderate minister Otherwise we would have gone to thirty or forty insults per minute which is Mr Zaragoza 's shooting ratio But well I was delighted to see him moreover I was delighted to see him sitting as a minister I 'm very fond of Mr. Zaragoza But this campaign I repeat smells like election campaign and I love this smell because it is a smell of decomposition of your government and of struggle for who will stay the PSOE 's mess and what remains of the PSOE after the next elections so you are taking control of each and every propaganda mechanism in this country own semi-pensioners semi-private non-citizens whatever you can They 're breaking the emergency glass to see how they can convince the Spaniards that this this this has to go on but they 're actually going to go home forever And leave the insults to another than to me Mr. Platero not to me Thank you very

#deBertoldiAndrea,"Mr President I would like to speak on the subject of the PNRR by splitting the reasoning into macro and micro-economics I start from the reasoning about microeconomy and I am referring to the first two aspects that each of us should have in mind when thinking about the PNRR I am thinking of the local authorities and I am addressing above all those colleagues who like me live in peripheral situations and are close to the problems of the small municipalities which are the great wealth of our country and know very well how difficult our local authorities are encountering I repeat in the effective achievement of the results of the PNRR I believe that each of you at least once has been called by mayors and local administrators concerned that with their own structures they are unable to respond to the PNRR 's calls and sometimes cannot even fully understand their prospects The first question I have to ask the Undersecretary and the Government is then what is really being done because we are not at the beginning but we are in the middle of the PNRR 's activity There 's no way that so many administrators still do n't know where to bang their heads This is the first point that the Government should keep in mind if it really cares about the good result and especially the good transition in the economy and territories of the investments that could be produced by the PNRR The other sector which is obviously connected to it is the construction sector because we know very well that all infrastructure depends on and is linked to the efficient functioning of the construction sector I would like to open a parenthesis then to remind you that this sector is dying that it is suffering greatly from another lack of government that is the fact that the tax credits linked to the building bonuses are blocked We have dozens of companies that have put workers in cash dozens of companies that can't pay for suppliers dozens of companies that risk bankruptcy And I am sure ladies and gentlemen that like my phone and my computer they are overburdened by the cries of pain of Italian companies and artisans in the construction sector even yours cannot but be equally attentive And what is the government doing Do we really want to kill the heart of Italian construction and then think about realizing the PNRR projects and infrastructure when we no longer have companies Will we take them from France perhaps thanks to those who have privileged relations in France Is that what we want to do Otherwise it is not explained how to combine the blockage to the enterprises through the cessions of the credits with the realization of a PNRR that obviously demands an Italian building capable of carrying out these works The theme is the relationship with SMEs We were taught by the Marshall Plan in the 1950s that a national and international investment plan is effective when the private sector is involved How did you involve our SMEs and when did you involve them They 're in exactly the same situation as those mayors on the outskirts who do n't know where to bang their heads There is another wish that I would like to address to the Government move because time is no longer there I would therefore pass for the sake of time to some reasoning in macro terms I would like to remind you as Gustavo Piga brilliantly explained in an article in the magazine Il Libero Professionista that the provision of PNRR funds is linked and conditioned by fiscal compact Let 's go back to this bad word which has penalized Italy so much for our passivity in previous years Well the fiscal compact that is the famous 3 in the debt to GDP ratio can still condition the disbursement of the funds because Article 21 of Regulation EU 2021/241 the one establishing the recovery plan before the PNRR provides for a suspension of the fiscal compact but this is not normal So today we 're going to be back in the fiscal compact if the government does n't act immediately and we risk due to the obvious impossibility of falling back into the parameters of the fiscal compact to see us block the financing of the PNRR I therefore suggest to President Draghi to read Gustavo Piga 's article and to deepen what the freelancers are emphasizing and screaming moreover in the usual carelessness towards the category which is now a habit Again on these issues what are we going to do about the issue of the economy and inflation Are we going to follow the path of monetary policy as in the United States where inflation comes from an excess of demand or do we think we are going to change strategy because inflation in Italy and Europe is not due to an excess of demand but to a supply shock because of the increase of raw materials So a monetary policy of austerity serves very little indeed creates stagflation We would like to have some answers on this point from Minister Franco and President Draghi we do not agree to move Italy towards the policy of stagflation but we are asking for development policies and therefore we are asking for action with a view to employment I run because I see that time is running thin and I move on to a brief summary to remind the Undersecretary and the Government that the first results of the PNRR are certainly not exciting It also says The Messenger these days talking about the flop of employment centers We should in fact guarantee 16,000 jobs in employment centres so that those receiving the new employment social insurance NASPI and citizenship income can be given work They are therefore 16,000 people to be hired thanks to the 5 billion euros of the PNRR but the Regions have hired only 3,000 of them with a frightening delay moreover in a country that first does the measures that is gives the money and then creates the tools that should have anticipated the measure If for the income of citizenship the employment instruments had previously been envisaged I repeat and only once they had been active had they been expected to be paid out it would have been a reasoning on which one could be confronted The opposite is the case and even with PNRR funds we are not able to hire the professionals needed to create jobs Let 's remember therefore also looking at the simple numbers provided by the Government that in the two years 2020 2021 that is in the last two years the Government of the 15 billion euros of expenditure expected has spent 5 and therefore we have a rate of absorption of the funds of the PNRR that is a third of the planned Would this be the Government of the best which has planned 15 billion euros and spent 5 billion euros in the two year period 2020 2021 according to official data As regards the prospects I welcome the fact that this morning Mr Cingolani finally gave a clear answer on the subject of gas and said in answer to my question in 10a The Commission has finally realised that national deposits must be recovered I am pleased better late than never as I said in the Commission In the answer however the government also says that there is no investment that we must invest to reopen the wells that is not easy because we lack we have deficiencies and we have maintenance to do I would like to ask the Undersecretary what we are doing to ensure that PNRR 's money flows into those gas investments but I am also thinking of rare lands lithium and the great mineral deposits we have in Italy I therefore ask what is being done to invest in the direction of energy autonomy which would be a first response to the geopolitical crisis not to give resources to those who want to wage war such as Russia Mr President in conclusion this would respond above all to the need to give Italians businesses and citizens the energy they need Mr President representative of the Government let us therefore make these investments and try to be more effective than unfortunately despite the constant warnings of the Brothers of Italy Group the majority has been able to do",#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-4.312291,-7.607036,0

#FaggiAntonella,Mr President ladies and gentlemen this measure is very important It is now known my way of intervening so as always I start with a thought that is not mine because you can find it anywhere but I think it is important to quote What is family The role of the family is very important in the life of each of us because it helps us in times of difficulty accompanies us advises us helps us to make decisions corrects us rejoices with us when we are successful always hoping for the best for us The family is the first environment in which the individual is inserted and relations with the family contribute to providing many of the fundamental tools for community integration The educational project of the family requires harmony between the various members of the family itself balanced growth of their personalities and this project is often carried out in an unconscious way through the creation of a network of relationships and messages which defines the mutual expectations and identity of those who are part of it Without the family you can feel lost not alone This is the first thought I have because the role of the family is fundamental for each of us You can find this everywhere but often this description is not consistent with the present way of life Often the role of the family as we see every day has been deformed debased in some way has been reduced to a mere name the family It 's often said you 're 40 now you have to make a family After a few years the same person who created a family might say I can't do this because I keep family Over the years the support which I have well explained here as a founding part of an individual loses value to the point of becoming a burden The family is a burden the children can be a burden the grandparents the uncles the elderly become a burden everything is reduced to a purely economic situation it costs too much I can't do it I can't Therefore that fundamental concept which should belong to each one of us from the moment of birth and in the path of his life is completely disregarded This discourse is linked to the measure under discussion and to the delegation to the Government of certain objectives that are fundamental because they give the possibility in such dark and difficult times as those we are going through not to lose the meaning of this fundamental concept of family We must help the family in all areas we must support it from an economic point of view we must help parenthood help women who want to work and at the same time want to be mothers we must help families because in these modern times the very concept of family has been lost Perhaps a hundred years ago there were no mobile phones there were no iPads there was no technological connection but there was the supply chain the true sense of the family the enlarged families who helped each other the one with the most willingness helped the poorest there was a relationship indeed a network of relationships that made the family a group of large families and for years in the growth of man and society it was so With time however modernity with its challenges that we have grasped has significantly changed the way of pigs but paradoxically reversing however the founding role of the family reducing it to a problem This measure on the other hand supports it and will certainly have to be completed because it contains delegations we know that the delegation to the Government must be exercised that we must get to concrete facts and its implementation The draft law in question regulates and brings together a whole series of rules already in place helping the family the children and all the aspects that I have touched on thus giving the opportunity to resume and revive the concept of family that we have gradually seen lost There are also many daily news reports in the newspapers that tell us about families in which there are dramatic situations about families who do not arrive at the end of the month and who do terrible acts and about children living in situations of great discomfort It is also important for citizens to know that the Government is putting in place a series of measures aimed at filling what very banally must be called loneliness being alone in dealing with certain problems I hope that this is only the beginning of the reordering of what has already been done aware that surely you cannot reach everything and everyone but that it is a first step that must be oriented towards further attention to this segment of life that we carry inside often accompanied by the feeling that it is not important enough Instead the family is because we all have a small or a large family maybe ours is well and has no problems but to turn the thought to those who have great difficulties is important Let me at this moment even if it has nothing to do with it turn my thoughts it is a constant thought that I have to those who no longer have the family because they are at war War does not give discounts to anyone the family in war loses it in the worst way cruelly and leaves a void that marks Past history has taught us and we have many significant testimonies of the past but apparently man has a short memory otherwise we should not see what we see the lonely children the destroyed families and what this situation will bring us Therefore let us prepare for us but also for others for those we welcome that we will have to welcome because they no longer have the family and if we make a serious and profound reflection we know that they have not only loneliness but an immense wound that money is not enough to repay,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,-2.2954032,-13.119583,0

#FerreroRoberta,Mr President ladies and gentlemen this very important measure acts in a simple way on our Constitution but it adds a fundamental piece a subject which is always a little neglected by these classrooms but which is so important for mental and physical well being Let 's talk about sports It should be remembered for those who listen that the only article in this draft Constitutional law goes to add these words to Article 33 of the Constitution The Republic recognizes the educational social and promotional value of the psychophysical well being of sport in all its forms I have always supported him and I have already supported him on several occasions in this House As a former cyclist passionate about this complete sport that gives wellness to the body and spirit today I say finally Finally this step is being taken in the right direction It is recognizing the value of sport of all sports that are a real touch for the physical and mental health of citizens Everyone should practice a sport Sport is a master of life In cycling the ascent teaches that in order to reach the summit you have to commit You have to be stubborn We must also suffer and thus reach the goal which is also satisfaction and satisfaction Then comes the descent You taste freedom but only after you have conquered it with the ascent Those who practice competitive sport know that practice teaches a method sport becomes discipline teaches to be part of society Team sports practiced since the young age teach to be an active part of a group of people with a common goal and so called individual sports teach to belong to a community that sharing the same passion also shares the principles Those who practice sports develop an exceptional physical strength and in any case a lower propensity to illness In fact people with health problems often find sports a valuable ally to overcome them thus making less and less use of pharmaceutical care Finally I would like to mention sports in disability I had the honour of meeting a beautiful girl who is no longer there today Sara Stealto Piedmontese who had made sport in disability her mission of life He also met Minister Stefani Sara had a weak heart which caused her some problems but with sport she accompanied the disabled Bringing the culture of sport into disability had also surpassed his disability Sport made her a strong person not a sick person With his Giro d'Italia solidaritye about fifty stages with arrival in Turin he brought this message throughout Italy bringing so many disabled people closer to sport Today Sara is gone but she would have been happy to see this passage that we are making here in the Senate today For this reason with the commitment to continue the valuable work that Sara was doing today I firmly thank Parliament for this important initiative which must be a first step in promoting sport at all levels and giving the right importance and dignity to sports practice,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,-6.980459,-5.116858,0

#AlessandriniValeria,"Mr President ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government it is my intention to share with you all a reflection on the importance that PNRR can take on in an area that I consider essential for the development of our society I am referring to education and training There are more hours spent in school than with the family it is at school that relationships are established not only of study for the children and of work for the teaching staff and not but also of friendship and sharing The school world is such a large container that inside it you find the universe not only education and work but the development of personality the growth of relationships sociality feelings and emotions and when you are a teacher you do not limit yourself to providing a service but you enter into the lives of children and families and they enter into yours with the creation of empathy and relationships The world of school has a strategic importance for the formation of tomorrow 's citizens and we must show respect consideration and sense of responsibility towards that world all too often forgotten developed by policies that are not respectful for the teaching class and for students as if it were a sector of series b. The young people and the teaching class perceive all this with a sense of discomfort because if we do not invest in a prudent way with the diligence of the good father of the family as was said making the best use of the opportunity of the PNRR we miss yet another opportunity to embark on a virtuous path And acting when it 's too late can mean not acting at all In this decree law we try to respond to what Europe asks us to do in the face of the share part of the financing of the Next generation EU equal to 24 billion that is a selection and training of the teachers that aim at the acquisition of pedagogical skills teaching and above all of the innovative didactics It is established that for the teaching profession of secondary schools of first and second degree including technical practical teachers it is necessary to undertake a university and academic course of initial training and qualification and then to make a competition in order to enter the role Access to the enabling routes is selective and the number is decided annually on the basis of the needs of teachers The course will allow the achievement of 60 university credits CFU which will allow access to the competitions at the professorship The attendance of these courses will be compulsory and in presence the latter criterion may be waived by a maximum of 20 All perfect a new world but a legislator who can be said to be so cannot ignore the imperfect world that exists today and must try to balance the legitimate expectations of new teachers with the rights that claim teachers who have allowed the school to operate in these years For example the theme of the 24 CFU was highly controversial The text fired by the Government a few weeks ago in fact did not contain any specification on what up to now is a requirement to access ordinary competitions for teachers School legislation must continue a mechanism cannot be envisaged until the day before and the next day it can be revolutionized without transitional arrangements Fortunately the senators have sheltered this Applause goes to the majority who at this time and at other times worked compactly and determined to improve a too drastic text in many respects to use euphemism On the financial cover front too the struggle was tough to cover the expenditure items of the new training mechanism with the resources of the teacher 's card seemed really indigestible and also on this aspect fortunately there was a change of pace Uncertainties remain about the cut of the chairs expected in 10,000 in the initial text now reduced on the basis of the criterion of demographic decline and turnover of 2026 Other adjustments have been approved in the Senate access for the first three cycles of the initial training course of those who are in service in the state or equal school within the limits of the reserve of the places indicated the remission to the national bargaining of the incentive the return in the beehive of the negotiation of the definition of the number of additional hours the access to the specialization on support for those who have already carried out three years in the activity We would have liked a greater consideration of the thousands of precarious people used for years in the school that could not have been enabled due to the lack of dedicated paths however it could have been expected that enabling paths for all categories of teachers could be foreseen to provide for the extension of the transitional phase in order to absorb the historical precariousness 2024 is too limited a time He should have insisted more and not bowed too much to the European Diktats The re-opening of the merit rankings of the candidates in the competitions would also have been useful Finally it is sad to think by the end of 2024 i.e. that fixed for the hypothetical absorption of the precarious ones of the access to the first open ended test may be this subordinate with DPCM to the overcoming of a pre-elective test I come from the world of school you know I am a teacher it is a professional role that has allowed me to be close to families and pupils in a climate of deep collaboration and growth especially through active listening also on the territories of all school staff managers administrative technical and auxiliary staff ATA the director of general and administrative services DSGA teachers in reflection pupils and families The school in addition to being an educational service to people represents a powerful strategic factor for the social and economic development of each country the cultural and professional formation of the new generations the true levers of our future depend on the school Along with all this the school still acts as a social elevator increasing and enhancing talents and changing destinies The education sector is the real pillar of our society the engine for our country 's socio-economic recovery at this time of great difficulties caused by the pandemic crisis and the consequences of the war in Ukraine I believe and hope that these reflections of mine also dictated by professional experience will be shared by everyone In addition in view of what many have said and last but not least by President Draghi politics in the institutional fora must respond decisively and concretely the school must return to being at the heart of every government 's commitment and we have demonstrated it these days It is necessary to have the courage to make a change of pace to invest more economic resources in the sector and to undertake compulsory training courses which do not favour inequalities but which aim exclusively to promote the professional growth of teachers All teachers need to be valued and can be valued if motivated and satisfied by their work they need a greater economic dignity precisely because of their important function and deserve respect from the moment of recruitment until they are put in place The recruitment of teachers cannot be translated into a cross quiz it is necessary to select teachers for their ability to convey love for knowledge for their ability to do innovative and inclusive teaching The real recruitment is on the ground and starts from that spirit that the teachers demonstrated with dedication and courage during the pandemic improvising platforms and new teaching methods for the love of their pupils so as not to make them lose their educational paths We are now investing in decisive policy action The renewal of the school requires a shared path listening to those who live it daily I conclude by thanking rapporteurs the members of the Commissions the Undersecretaries the Group Leaders in particular Senators Saponara and Pirovano who have followed us in this difficult and complex path from which emerged a cohesive and determined parliamentary majority to achieve common objectives for education demonstrating that sense of responsibility which I hope will be repeated in the actions of the Government that sense of responsibility which at a time of economic and social crisis of war of pandemics of uncertainty such as this in which citizens seek concrete and effective answers from those who govern them should serve as a lighthouse for our political action and our work",#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo

#SaponaraMaria,"SAPONARA L SP PSd Az Mr President ladies and gentlemen Minister and members of the Government a few days ago I had the honour of participating in my city Parma in the award of the new titles of masters of work by the National Federation of Labour Masters The thing that struck me most during the event in addition to the variety of professionalism awarded was the illustration of the projects that the Federation itself has developed and is carrying on from primary school to maturity with the aim of promoting the inclusion of young levers in the world of work helping them in their training and professional choices These projects are modulated and differentiated according to the order and degree of school at the end of which students are asked to express their experience and expectations Precisely in one of these comments it was written that children 's dreams should be recognized and transformed into interests and passions so that constancy desire and abilities have a way of being born in the person and of feeding themselves over time until becoming a profession It has made me think a lot about the responsibility we have as legislators in stimulating and accompanying young people towards cultural and vocational training choices that really reflect their skills and aspirations a responsibility that goes hand in hand with an appropriate organization and functioning of education and training institutions at all levels and at all levels from primary to secondary school from humanistic to mathematical scientific and professional This responsibility is all the more accentuated by the fact that school and the whole education system are at a time of great change from the educational point of view and also of adapting to the needs of the work sector In this context ITS play an important role whose redefinition of the mission and organisation has been called for in implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and has been entrusted with a bill of parliamentary initiative at second reading here in the Senate and today under discussion in this House To illustrate why ITS play an important role in the context of the education system it is worth remembering that when we talk about ITS we refer to higher post graduate courses which offer highly qualified technical training to enter the world of work immediately The ITS courses in fact are carried out in collaboration with companies universities research centres and local authorities to develop new skills in technological areas considered strategic for the economic development and competitiveness of the country The ITS therefore constitute the segment of tertiary non-university training which responds to the demand of the enterprises of new and high technical and technological skills to promote the processes of innovation and represent an opportunity of absolute importance in the Italian educational landscape as an expression of a new strategy based on the connection of education training and work policies with industrial policies with the objective of supporting the interventions destined to the productive sectors with particular reference to the needs of innovation and technological transformation of small and medium sized enterprises Six of the technological areas concerned to which courses can be accessed after a pre-selection after the diploma of upper secondary education courses normally divided into four semesters which can be up to six which allow you to have an experience in internship in the company During this period of vocational training students have the opportunity to experiment directly on the ground with the skills acquired and to contribute to the development of the processes of business digitisation thanks to the knowledge and innovative dynamics proper to the superior technicians It is clear therefore that ITS courses are built through a shared and shared design by all stakeholders and not least are co-financed by the European Social Fund 's regional operational programme That of ITS is therefore an alternative path to university ones which responds to the vocation and desire of all those girls and all those boys who want to specialize in specific areas and who can transform children 's dreams into high level professionalism and become competitive adults and realized in the world of work not only at national level but also at European level and why not also at international level As legislators therefore given the importance that ITS have we have the task of ensuring that the system works and is efficient During the work of the Commission thanks to the hearings and the continuous and intense interlocations with the Regions and the associations of category we think we have done a good job and today with the approval of this Assembly we return to the House a bill enriched with new elements thanks to the contribution of the amendments and proposals also of the League Group And I would remind you that some of these proposals have been included in the rapporteur 's amendments which I thank and others accepted individually such as the one which excludes the teaching director from being chosen from among the school managers of the secondary schools of second degree members of the foundation and that representatives of the school directors of the secondary schools of second degree members of the foundation are legally involved in the scientific committee a first signed amendment by Senator Alessandrini and shared by Senators Pittoni and Saponara He regretted the failure to accept the amendment at my first signature but always shared by the Lega Group which was not accepted by the Government which provided for the participation of the employers in the ITS committee We are aware that the lack of acceptance of certain requests may give rise to some bad moods But what we have tried to ensure is that the system can be spread throughout the national territory supported by adequate professionalism and subject to a control that ensures its efficiency and guarantees the real specialization as well as the integration in the world of work of girls and boys who will choose ITS to transform their dreams of children Only to give a few numbers there are 120 ITS on the national territory related to six technological areas To give an idea most of the ITS is located in Lombardy which has 20 follow Sicily 11 Tuscany Calabria and Campania 9 Lazio 8 Emilia Romagna Piedmont and Veneto 7 Puglia and Liguria 6 Abruzzo and Sardinia 5 the Marches and Friuli Venezia Giulia 4 but only one foundation is present in Molise Umbria and Basilicata Emilia -Romagna Piedmont and Lombardy are the Regions that in addition have all ITS in all technological areas The currently active routes are 60 still in Emilia Romagna 701 members and just to give a number the total number of graduates of the completed and monitored routes is 2,290 with 1,841 employed Which means ITS is a good solution for professionalism Convinced therefore of the important function of ITS and that the bill so varied can ensure an adequate and efficient functioning the Lega Salvini Premier Partito Sardo d'Azione Group will vote in favour Thanks go to the President of the Commission the rapporteurs and all the Commissioners",#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo

#SaponaraMaria,Mr President ladies and gentlemen the representative of the Government the Memory Travel Fund very briefly is the title of the bill that we are called upon to dismiss in this House today after the examination in the 7th Commission From the title the bill may appear or suggest something fascinating and romantic but in reality it intends to strengthen Law No 211 of 20 July 2000 with which the Day of Memory was established in memory of the extermination and persecution of the Jewish people and the Italian military and political deportees in the Nazi camps To understand and understand it better it is worth briefly retracing the stages that led to the establishment of a day dedicated to the memory of the shoah a Hebrew term by which the extermination of the Jews victims of the Nazi genocide is indicated identified on January 27 as the day of the liberation of the concentration camp in Auschwitz It is from 1960 with a renewal of school programs that we begin to embark on the path of the recovery of memory and the historiographical debates on subjects of deportation and shoah take on some importance also for the resonance aroused by important trials in Germany against the Nazi executioners and the success of audiences of fundamental literary testimonies on the shoah such as the books of Primo Levi and Anna Frank which become real classic beds and studied also in schools The ministerial decree of 4 November 1996 n. 682 dictated changes to the history programs in schools of every order and grade broadening the attention on the facts of the twentieth century and giving the start from that moment to a particular attention to the racial laws to the relations between fascism and deportation to the history of the concentration camps leading to the development of numerous projects that often end with travels in the places of memory and in the aforementioned fields From then on the use of testimony has become a fundamental element in the teaching of the shoah The encounter with the witness has always been fundamental because it creates a huge empathy and gives students the opportunity to touch history and to embark on a path of knowledge capable of affecting their lives in a lasting way trying to avoid the risk of emotion passing and remaining nothing of what has been heard and learned Finally in 2000 the institution of Memory Day with Law No. 211 of 2000 has encouraged more and more school initiatives the protagonists of which have often been the survivors with their stories of imprisonment Mr President I am sorry but there is a lot of confusion this is something I think everyone is interested in,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,-0.60023683,-10.429245,0
#SaponaraMaria,Mr Saponara rapporteur While it is true that the direct listening of the witnesses who survived that hell is fundamental in order to move the consciences of the young it is equally true that with the passing of the years those same witnesses are less and less so the direct vision of the places becomes even more important in order to keep alive the memory of the facts From this last consideration came the need to offer students a greater opportunity to visit them because those places can speak they can tell the tragedy of those who have suffered enormous atrocities in them and of those who while surviving them are no longer there It is therefore the aim of the bill today in this House to make it easier for young people to reflect on the sad chapter of history The draft law consists of only one article modulated according to the indications of the opinion of the 5th Commission This article announces the above mentioned Law No 211 of 20 July 2000 with the establishment at the Ministry of Education of a fund with a budget of one million euros for each of the years 2022 2023 and 2024 to promote and encourage while respecting school autonomy the memory trips to Nazi concentration camps for students of the last two years of secondary schools of second degree in order to mature the civic consciousness of the new generations with respect to the extreme suffering suffered by the Jewish people during the Nazi persecution of the shoah It will therefore always be up to the Ministry of Education with its own decree to be adopted within ninety days of the entry into force of the law to define the modalities of use of the resources and to determine the type of financial expenses On the other hand the Ministry of Economic Affairs has the task with its own decree of making the necessary changes in the budget As rapporteur for the measure I presented an agenda to the Commission accepted by the Government with the invitation to assess the need to include in the implementing decree the increase if possible in the years of this fund and to ensure that at least 40 of these resources are allocated primarily to the organization of memory travel by secondary schools of second degree located in areas disadvantaged or characterized by the presence of students in a state of social distress and finally to provide forms of awareness to the organization of memory travels and other forms of deepening of the history of the shoah addressed to schools that have not organized such trips in the previous three years This in summary is the content of the bill Before concluding Mr President I would like to thank Mrs Daisy Pirovano who as soon as she signed the bill showed great sensitivity to this issue and of course the entire Lega Group who signed it I thank the President of the 7th Commission Senator Riccardo Nencini and all my fellow Commission senators who have supported and shared the bill and its process Finally I would like to thank the Undersecretary Barbara Floridia for his willingness to accompany us until the end of this process both in the Commission and today in this House where I hope that the House will vote unanimously,#group.L-SP-PSd.Az,Lega-Salvini Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,-0.5878147,-10.423505,0

#CantuMariaCristina,Mr President I take advantage apparently out of the question to express my bitterness for losing the opportunity first in the budget law and now in the context of the conversion of the unified measure with the Government 's amendment for not being able to take care of those who cared recognizing at least a refreshment to the families of doctors who especially during the first part of the pandemic when they lacked everything from the pandemic plan to the personal protective devices and little was known of how to deal with the virus with a spirit of self denial have tried to limit sometimes at the expense of their own life the pandemic effects for their patients I am very sorry that the sub- amendment although it was shared by all the Groups including and I thank you for that opposition for unknown reasons has been downgraded to non-priority while in its time for example funds have been found for shelters that save wild animals a very meritorious issue but from my point of view of priority very much after that of the refreshment of those who saved human lives We have lost two battles but we cannot afford to lose the war even if we know that nothing will return to the affection of their families those who have lost their lives But in their memory we will not disregard anything indeed we will try to re-produce it in every place moving from words to deeds well before March 18 the first anniversary of the established National Day in memory of the victims of the coronary virus epidemic so as not to leave it meaningless because believe me sometimes the medical class is underestimated compared to what it actually does for the common good As we enter the evolutionary perspective of the measure under discussion it teaches us that we must be forward looking because unforeseen events especially in the health field are a variable to be taken into account even more than in other areas And we can no longer afford to chase the reality having to approach with method the prevention and recovery of delays in care to honour the truth already intolerable well before the pandemic in a framework of systemic vision of proactive prevention and of governance of individual and collective risks because otherwise we will face an announced hecatombe with incisive dispositions to make effective the predictive analysis and the surveillance systems indicated but still unimplemented In the same way we must act effectively with very persuasive mechanisms on the monitoring of resources controls and responsibility of the entire chain which up to now is not allowed to trace with the exception at least partial of the measures provided for in the decree support-b which makes us believe that our confidence to the Government although with some criticality of the way and even if it has gone a little long was and is well placed Do n't disappoint us with the refreshment of doctors we also make sense of the President 's words It is a decidedly challenging perspective in terms of order review to guarantee the effective implementation of mission 6 of the PNRR with an innovative government of health and new rules of engagement of the distributors including doctors of general medicine also regarding the proactive integration between hospital and territorial medicine going to reduce the incidence of the risks of pathologies not only infectious with an accredited network and contract of care continuity for levels of intensity and timeliness of care the Government on this despite the appreciable efforts should have a little more marked impact in evaluation and controls of appropriateness and security in a framework of full institutional responsibility The same should also apply to conscious adherence to vaccination prophylaxis because the increased confidence of citizens in the state should indirectly overcome many of the concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines as I will never stop pointing out we are among those who believe that we must convince not to force and one of the strongest arguments to convince those who hesitate and are opposed to the vaccine is that the State takes full responsibility for any adverse effects From our point of view a great step forward has been taken also with regard to the application impact of the measures provided for in the decree law in conversion with Article 20 of the decree- b since it has finally revealed the concept that an obligation cannot be imposed even in a surreptitious form without assuming the responsibility for the possible consequences from January 27 thanks to the thrust of the League all this is norm Acting in the prevention and promotion of the health of the person the family and the community through conscious adherence is therefore another battle that we must know how to fight and win together the way of our future by combining protection of health and fundamental freedoms according to ethics and responsibilities,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,-4.1419506,-10.151838,0
#CantuMariaCristina,Mr President I understand that there is war and that we must deal primarily with refugees and the devastating consequences on the economy but I would like to point out that there has already been war here an epidemic war with the effects that we all know And there are those who in this war fought for us and fell to give us the chance to return to normal I do n't want to think that they are selfish shopkeepers because it was proposed by the League to make sure that it is not recognized now without if and without but to the families of doctors who died in the first phase of the Covid a proper refreshment As far as we are concerned it is not important that we call it the Cantù amendment for me we can also call it the Belzebu amendment provided that we approve it In fact our bill no 1061 of February 2019 was inspired by the measures taken and adopted to overcome the shortage of doctors and the consequent reduction of waiting lists No one has made it a matter of primacy the important thing is to do and do well In the same way for the new rules of engagement of retailers including doctors of general medicine the so called DM 71 provides for a series of important measures already proposed in the bill n. 2153 for the reorganization of the emergency emergency pre-hospital and hospital of March last year Let the Ministry of Health take due account of the elaborations of the League for the strengthening of territorial care in turn integrated with the continuity of assistance that we have already proposed in our draft laws So for refreshment to the families of the deceased doctors provided it is approved now without further referrals and delays This brings us back to the House despite the contrary opinion in the Commission of Health Ministries and for equal opportunities and family at least as I have been told Show that it is not true in view of the promised confidence in the amendment fully replacing the measure under discussion We do n't need the cockard but we did n't think the government needed it either Call it whatever you want as long as you do without further postponement because just a year ago we agreed that the day of remembrance would be established and that the government would undertake to find the necessary funds to honor them dignifiedly in addition to providing measures for the remaining categories of health and social health workers directly involved and for those who have suffered major permanent impairments to the psychophysical integrity not subject to protection All this finalizing the necessary resources correctly and congruly since as we have had the opportunity to remark in every place such cannot be considered those allocated to date by the Government with the appreciable first step made in article 31 of Decree Law No. 17 of 2022 I would not like a superstructure to be created in order to recognise the measure which could absorb part of what is allocated which is already insufficient in its own right in order to maintain itself It 's what you do that defines what you are we prove that you do it and excuse me if I insist that we do it right,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,-4.2115545,-10.18415,0
