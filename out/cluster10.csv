#OnofreMirallesMartín,Thank you very much Madam President With the venom Dear Patricia the grass is green the milk is white the mosquitoes sting and a person condemned for the heightening of terrorism has a name and taking away the word for using that name in this House is a shame Long live freedom A motion by the Group of the European People 's Party is being debated by which the Government is roughly urged to restore 100 per cent of the railway services suspended after the state of alarm the recovery of the crew of drivers the promotion of improvement plans the revision of the tariff system as well as the impetus of the Mediterranean and Atlantic corridors which has been somewhat washed up because they have introduced this last point of the petitum which in my view does not come too far from the point of view although it is a necessity as I say it does not come to the point From the reading of the motion and the intervention of the Socialist spokesman he recalled the increasingly common strategy that is brought to the parliamentary debate which is that of the tennis party without a network in which there are no rules no technique no capacity the reproaches are eternal and therefore the infrastructures are eternal in the face of the absolute despair of the spectators who are the suffering Spaniards sick of racquets of left and abidextres The first set of this hypothetical networkless tennis game is the AVE to Extremadura which was promised in writing ten years ago by the Socialist Party 's infrastructure spokesman and now mocks when remembered The second set of this hypothetical networkless tennis game could be the train from Motril to Granada A few days ago the brilliant secretary general of Infrastructures of the ministry announced that he has rejected the project as unviable giving negative TIR data reaching that conclusion without a feasibility study which seems to me colossal With such effective politicians it is unquestionable that we will save the unspeakable in studies and of course in works brilliance and efficiency said in quotes which Mr Rodríguez Gómez de Celis has also shown today That gift is seen to be inoculated at Jaime Vera That secretary general of the PSOE that was at the head of the demands of the Granada Motril train is of the same party that was at the head of the yellow tides demanding in Granada the underground of the AVE Today that PSOE turns their faces to the neighbors of La Chana Pajaritos Rosaleda and the youth barriad and now the PP is jealous of them without remembering that before that same PP turned his back on them I take advantage of the change of set to tell you that today those bikers and dummies who were talking about last week at the expense of budgets are meeting with their banner in Catalan asking for infrastructures at the door of the Palace of the Moncloa,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,34.713722,-5.6922593,10,thank much madam president venom dear patricia grass green milk white mosquitoes sting person condemned heightening terrorism name taking away word using name house shame long live freedom motion group european people 's party debated government roughly urged restore 100 per cent railway services suspended state alarm recovery crew drivers promotion improvement plans revision tariff system well impetus mediterranean atlantic corridors somewhat washed introduced last point petitum view come far point view although necessity say come point reading motion intervention socialist spokesman recalled increasingly common strategy brought parliamentary debate tennis party without network rules technique capacity reproaches eternal therefore infrastructures eternal face absolute despair spectators suffering spaniards sick racquets left abidextres first set hypothetical networkless tennis game ave extremadura promised writing ten years ago socialist party 's infrastructure spokesman mocks remembered second set hypothetical networkless tennis game could train motril granada days ago brilliant secretary general infrastructures ministry announced rejected project unviable giving negative tir data reaching conclusion without feasibility study seems colossal effective politicians unquestionable save unspeakable studies course works brilliance efficiency said quotes mr rodríguez gómez de celis also shown today gift seen inoculated jaime vera secretary general psoe head demands granada motril train party head yellow tides demanding granada underground ave today psoe turns faces neighbors la chana pajaritos rosaleda youth barriad pp jealous without remembering pp turned back take advantage change set tell today bikers dummies talking last week expense budgets meeting banner catalan asking infrastructures door palace moncloa

#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,Thank you Madam President We are very interested in everything that relates to nature conservation and indeed to the right of the disabled to enjoy nature You progressives believe you have the monopoly of love for nature the monopoly of ecological concern but remember where the word ecology comes from it comes from oikos which in Greek means home That 's something he always liked to remind conservative philosopher Roger Scruton He maintained that the basic attitude of the conservative was precisely ecology that is love of the home The basic attitude of the conservative is gratitude gratitude to all that our ancestors have bequeathed to us and what the ancestors have bequeathed to us includes not only a way of life not only moral norms institutions but also natural places and there is no contradiction in that We have also received natural sites from the ancestors mountains rivers and forests In the Anthropocene there is no more virgin nature in the strict sense every landscape is a human landscape even if it is only to the extent that man has deliberately decided to respect it The basic attitude of progressives on the other hand is contempt for the past You progressives see the past as a long night of machism class domination racism homophobia The problem of progressiveism is that as always the past was worse than the present they are condemned to be despised by the progressives of the future This was said very well by Gómez Dávila who wrote progressiveism ages badly Each generation brings a new model of progressiveism that defies the previous one There is one aspect of this GNP that does not convince us and that is that it is drafted in such a way that it seems to attribute to NGOs or the Biodiversity Foundation or not well defined entities the power to declare visitors outside beautiful places that may be privately owned In this way the alleged right to universal accessibility can become an alibi for the emptying of private property de facto expropriation In fact the Anglo Saxon world is already talking about the right to roaming that is the right to wander around the neighbor 's estate on the pretext that it is beautiful and that beauty is of everyone But above all there is one aspect of this GNP which is particularly incongruent to us as in general all that you do about the rights of the disabled and that is that you are concerned about the right of the disabled to access national parks but not the right of the disabled to life to access life because if the disabled are not allowed to be born how can they go to national parks And remember that there are forms of disability with a genetic basis that are disappearing in Spain but not because they no longer give but because those who suffer from it are exterminated in the womb It is estimated that between 90 and 95 of Down syndrome fetuses for example are aborted in Spain at present There is one European country that has already reached 100 per cent In Iceland children with Down syndrome are no longer born and all are destroyed in the womb Of course Icelandic society would have made Rosenberg Himmler and the other Nazi hierarchs pale with envy Because the Nazis sought a society without disabilities a society formed only by healthy individuals what happens is that they practiced postnatal eugenics and in very civilized and progressive Europe we are practicing prenatal eugenics You are progressive you are considered the champions of equality and inclusiveness Well this selective extermination of the disabled in the mother 's womb is being facilitated by a eugenic law such as the current abortion law which provides for a longer special period of no less than twenty two weeks for fetuses suffering from some malformation i.e. some disability Needless to say at twenty two weeks a fetus sucks its finger a fetus can yawn can play with the umbilical cord and of course can feel pain PNL it has

#CarlosJoséZambranoGarcíaRáez,With venial Mr. President I want to start by talking first about ways Ladies and gentlemen the Socialist Group obtained a majority in the last elections and is the largest group with one hundred and twenty Members That majority got it with deceit and false promises but it got it and the exercise of that majority is a responsibility However since the beginning of the parliamentary term from minute one the attitude towards the VOX Group has been to systematically reject our initiatives and amendments even if they were of obvious and palmary common sense and in the processing of this law it has been no different That attitude only denotes pride in the exercise of that majority an absolute lack of humility which then brings the problems that it brings and that we have all been able to verify Listening and reasoning is not bad it not only harms the legislative process itself the law itself but binds them to sectarianism The first thing the Socialist Group should be interested in is therefore a minimum of humility in the exercise of that responsibility Ladies and gentlemen in dealing with the Fisheries Act the first thing we must consider is that fisheries resources are public resources and therefore belong to all Spaniards without distinction of regions or any other similar consideration Its regulation and management must therefore respond to the national interest and equality of all Spaniards The law and its development must respond to a national fisheries strategy and policy in which Spain 's interests prevail over partisan regionalist interests or the interests of specific business sectors The autonomous system involves a waste of energy and resources seventeen autonomous communities producing a multitude of disparate regulations and seventeen administrations demanding competences taxes and maintaining an unusual political class with their corresponding clientele and servitudes this is joined by the perverse claim of regionalist privileges This reality translates into inequalities between Spaniards from both regions and these inequalities can also be reflected in this area in fisheries That is why with our amendments we seek to deepen the need to eliminate existing imbalances and differences between vessels and fishermen based solely on regional criteria All Spaniards are equal and we must start from that equality when considering the rights to fisheries resources Regionalist privileges must disappear Furthermore it is not reasonable that the consultation required of the Autonomous Communities has been increased to at least 30 different situations in this Act What must prevail is consultation with the sector concerned On the other hand a genuine national fisheries policy is incompatible with the submission of an 2030 Agenda and the reports of a group of supposed experts on climate change because these globalist agendas do not have a realistic plan for our fisheries sector and their decisions are taken from the backs of the Spanish and in particular from the backs of the fisheries sector our fishermen Curiously not long ago the minister himself Mr Planas regretted that the European Commission closed eighty seven areas for fishing wrongly and without taking into account any up to date scientific information or as the minister said the economic and social consequences of this measure he said so before opening the National Assembly of Fishermen 's Brotherhoods That is precisely one of the criteria that our group has taken into account in drawing up our amendment and which surprisingly we have seen in the words of the minister himself This is our amendment to Article 4 which the Socialist Group has however rejected The precautionary principle is useful if applied proportionally and taking into account the economic and social consequences and that is the objective of the amendment It is absolutely necessary to highlight in the law the social and economic benefits of fishing activity as guiding principles We believe that it is in the national interest to give special support to two key sectors of the population on the one hand small scale fishing small scale fishing and on the other hand young people We have already talked here about the minor arts or artisanal fishing which generates employment quality employment and which generates above all important economic activity on the coast and which stands out for its contribution to the national gross domestic product In our amendments we also insist on supporting young people on the need to facilitate their incorporation into fishing activity on the conviction that we must ensure generational relevancy and safeguard the continuity of the Spanish fishing sector which is the first in the European Union with more than 8700 vessels Young people and equality are the principles that are upheld in our amendments to article 40 which seek to shield the principle of support for young people by law The reserves should have remained at 10 It makes no sense that it was reduced in the parliamentary procedure to 5 We argue that these reserves apply precisely to those possibilities of support for youth and generational relief which can also be used to compensate for imbalances in the current distribution between ships and regions We cannot agree with the text that has been given to the fourth additional provision to which the Basque Group referred The text initially made it clear that the distributions,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,36.844475,-7.766032,10,venial mr. president

#CarlosJoséZambranoGarcíaRáez,As I said to them the text initially made it clear that the distributions of pre-law fishing opportunities could be modified by reason of the new regulation and it was logical because that was the principle of equality that I told them at the beginning However the Socialist Group 's members have yielded to the Basque Group 's claims and the validity of the previous allocations will not be affected by the entry into force of this law This text will certainly give rise to problems not only in its application but also in its interpretation In short ladies and gentlemen whatever the case this law establishes a basis including nothing but sixteen express development permits and a generic one to develop it by royal decree We can only urge the ministry not to stop listening to fishermen to remember that all Spaniards are equal and not to forget the social and economic benefits of the fisheries sector equality young people and help with artisanal fishing Let 's give them a break and fight to shield criteria of distribution that allow them to sustain their ships and their families Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,36.870205,-7.693931,10,said text initially made clear distributions pre-law fishing opportunities could modified reason new regulation logical principle equality told beginning however socialist group 's members yielded basque group 's claims validity previous allocations affected entry force law text certainly give rise problems application also interpretation short ladies gentlemen whatever case law establishes basis including nothing sixteen express development permits generic one develop royal decree urge ministry stop listening fishermen remember spaniards equal forget social economic benefits fisheries sector equality young people help artisanal fishing let 's give break fight shield criteria distribution allow sustain ships families thank much
#RicardoChamorroDelmo,Thank you very much Madam President Minister ladies and gentlemen one more year we find ourselves again in the analysis of these budgets for Agriculture Fisheries and Food which change very little year after year and the change is always worse Two years ago we talked about the difficult situation for the agricultural sector in the face of the crisis of COVID last year the beginning of inflation and the unusual rise in production costs and this year the global instability caused by the war in Ukraine and an eco-radical CAP and the ruin that you all approved in Brussels against common sense Minister the Spanish are starving inflation has reduced the purchase of fresh food by 57 and many farmers farmers and fishermen are in ruins How is it possible that the ministry of the things of eating is the one that has least increased the item in these budgets Why do you think he 's here Precisely so that the agri food sector suffers as little as possible in these very negative circumstances you are here at the head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Spain to defend the agricultural and food sector in Spain to prevent the ruin of farmers farmers and fishermen and to ensure that no one in Spain goes hungry You understand that do n't you It 's very easy to understand You are here precisely to cushion all these negative circumstances not to serve you as an excuse You have not been able to negotiate with your government colleagues more than an increase of 0.3 That is all Minister 0.3 This contrasts with the huge increases in the budget of other ministries such as the Ecological Transition the 2030 Agenda Consumption or Equality i.e. ideology Those are the issues that we see that this Government is increasing it is the ideology that matters to this Government Agriculture Fisheries and Food is the portfolio that loses the most with 16.2 less leaving the state 's contribution yes Minister in 1185 million euros We already knew that this government cares more about demagogy than about eating they care more about climate fanaticism than about farmers they care about animalism more than about cattle farmers they care more about the Green Pact than about fishermen they care more about the 2030 Agenda than about our rural world Year after year we see in the budgets of Agriculture Fisheries and Food their lack of interest in food sovereignty There are 15 ministries with budgets above the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food This year again 88 of the resources of this budgetary policy come from European funds Again this year the State is making a difference in the co-financing of EAFRD funds for rural development Mr Minister there is room for the state to contribute extraordinary money because it is a fund that was used to increase the competitiveness of the agricultural sector to sustainably manage natural resources and climate action that climate you are talking about all the time or to achieve a balanced territorial development of rural economies and communities in the face of an alarming situation of depopulation in our rural Spain A strategic sector for the economy of this country and for our sovereignty such as the national agri-food sector which accounts for 10 of Spain 's gross domestic product is settled with 1.8 of the total budget allocated by the Government for all ministries We do n't give credit Mr Minister the agricultural sector is going through a very difficult situation of which you are aware suffering from a very severe drought which has reduced production an insurmountable increase in energy production costs fuels seeds fertilizers fertilizers unfair competition from products coming from outside Europe the consequences of the war in Ukraine which have become evident in the sector and which you have previously spoken about in your intervention and with prices at source which do not compensate for the costs of production All of this makes the budget proposed by his ministry ridiculous Minister what needs to be done is to give direct aid to the agricultural and livestock sectors most affected by the crisis Tax measures should be taken to reduce agricultural gas oil fertilizers and plastics in the IRPF You fill your mouth with climate emergency but do not apply this climate catastrophe when it comes to compensating those who really suffer damage from drought fires or hail which are farmers The budget for the modernisation of irrigation as well as the new water infrastructures which are essential for this productive sector and which make it sustainable must be increased What happens is that what we see and what we already know is the commitment of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party to the water infrastructure you who are responsible for repealing the transfer of the Ebro by the votes of the Republican Left of Catalonia and who are right now throwing dams and water infrastructure The worst is yet to come because we must now implement this radical common agricultural policy which absolutely does not understand anyone in the agricultural sector with 40 of environmental conditions cut in amounts and aid We want to take this opportunity to show our support to the farmers who will protest tomorrow at this common agricultural policy of ruin in Madrid and will also do so on Saturday in Toledo With this CAP of ruin it could not be otherwise that the budgets of agriculture are rickish and useless for the sector a minimum contribution within general budgets which are the budgets of the ruin of Spain Thank you very

#RicardoChamorroDelmo,Thank you Madam President Firstly the recognition by this parliamentary group of those who work in prevention surveillance and protection services our regret to all those Spaniards in the rural world who have lost everything in these devastating fires and our condolences to the deceased There are about 300 000 hectares of calcined land including several protected areas of great ecological importance Those who came to fight for biodiversity and sustainability with their 2030 agendas and their ecological demagogy are devastating our peoples and our fields for lack of prevention by leaving and demagogy In just seven years since 2015 the People 's Party put us on the 2030 agenda fires multiply biodiversity declines rural depopulation accelerates and the profitability of the primary sector collapses The demographic winter is raging in our rural areas and the fire is burning hundreds of thousands of hectares You are climate change since you ruled with your 2030 agenda and destructive environmental legislation If all this apocalyptic weather that the Minister has raised was so predictable why have you done absolutely nothing You pose us practically the end of the world and that there is nothing to do That is the panorama that they pose us it is like the song of Sinister Total that poses us the extinction of the human race The reality is that fires go out in winter everyone knows this with a certain interest in avoiding fires The environmental legislation that you and the former have developed for years prevents you from doing preventive work because of an excess of protectionism and bureaucracy which often prevents you not only from expediting these tasks but also from carrying them out They do n't seem to be very interested in my intervention The plans for the management of natural spaces protected by the new environmentalist paradigm carried out by this Government and the People 's Party following these globalist environmentalist agendas in Brussels are hell for the prevention and management of public and private mountains We have as examples the radical eco-legislation in national parks nature parks reserves Red Natura 2000 The competent administrations have drastically and exponentially reduced investment in reforestation and forest management and this is a fact that can be seen There are public farms that have burned for example in the province of Ciudad Real whose firewalls had not been cleaned up due to bureaucratic problems in hiring management companies For example Agenda 2030 's Sustainable Development Goal 15 the life of terrestrial ecosystems challenges traditional practices associated with key sectors with extraordinary economic roots such as deforestation hunting or forest management which have been tested as effective methods for the rural environment and fire prevention The principle of human non-intervention in the natural environment whether in management conservation or exploitation has become a quasi- religious principle of progressive politicians that is being devastating in Europe 's human ecosystems The Administration is prohibiting the intervention in the natural environment of people living in the rural world forcing them to leave the countryside a field that has been managed and transformed by man for thousands of years This royal decree law has much more to do with the extinction of forest fires than with prevention to which they play a secondary role Prevention is essential The requests declarations and demonstrations of the entire technical community of our country involved in the extinction and prevention of forest fires have for decades been pointing to the large amount of forest fuel accumulated in our mountains and environmental policies imposed that do not favour forest management Of the fourteen pages that comprise this royal decree law only three and a half are those that refer to the article concerning the adoption of urgent measures in the field of forest fires The article is full of repetitions and questions that are already being carried out and that do not bring anything new and therefore are a real toast to the sun With regard to Article 1 3 we think that the amendment referring to the intercession of the State is appropriate a fact which highlights important lack of coordination between some autonomous plans for extinction rather because of political rivalries than because of strictly technical factors as it should be Let us remember that the Montes Act that was amended was developed by the People 's Party in 2003 verifying for decades the lack of coordination by the transfer of all fire skills to autonomous communities outside the Spanish State Another failure of that autonomous fundamentalism that everyone shows The article while we see it very necessary and widely demanded by the different regional extinction devices we call it unambitious and urge the Government to develop it in a regulation at the national level that definitely homogenizes at the national level what has been demanding for decades the emergency services of forest fires and the state security bodies and forces In short the royal decree law in no way solves problems but rather becomes complicated by its indefiniteness redundancy and administrative overload over existing legislation It is also a missed opportunity to address truly important issues such as specific regulation with regard to the serious problem of forest fire prevention in the urban forest interface In VOX we are clear that for our mountains our rural world and our biodiversity to continue to exist it is necessary for you to leave the government urgently and for VOX to develop your agenda which is Spain Thank you very

not want to reduce this initiative to a ministry and we have proposed an amendment for a drastic reduction of the mastodontic structure of ministries so that almost half of them are eliminated and thus set an example of reducing public spending and efficiency In particular we demanded the elimination of three of the four vice presidencies and ten of the twenty two ministries so that the new structure of the Government would move from twenty three people to thirteen with the president at its head The oversized structure of the Government accounts for a minimum cost of almost EUR 16 million per year only in high ranking salaries We want Spain to stop having the government with more ministries in the European Union However despite considering this initiative by the People 's Parliamentary Group to be insufficient it should be noted that this proposal focuses on the Ministry of Consumer Affairs in the context of the entrepreneurial statements of Minister Garzón attacking livestock the meat sector and the quality of our exports He is a minister who has previously attacked various economic sectors such as the toy industry the candy industry and the tourism sector or who pushes the Nutri Score label against our Mediterranean diet Garzón 's latest statements are a real attack by the Government of Spain on an agri -food sector that is very important to Spain 's national interest As I said in the Permanent Chamber there is no justification for these statements by Garzón even though the consensus media have tried to whiten them What a Spanish minister can never do is make absolutely false statements abroad saying that our meat is of poor quality and that an industry in Spain is dedicated to contaminating soil and water and then exporting meat from abused animals declarations made in addition to a British newspaper financed by the powerful global animalist industry This government not only has an oversized structure with absurd ministries such as the one that governs the totalitarian communist Garzón which pays all Spaniards in the midst of a brutal crisis and which should of course be suppressed but every time they make statements of this kind they show that they are working against the interests of the Spanish people and our productive system This Government executes foreign dictates alien to our interests whether they be global social engineering agendas for the benefit of anti-national economic elites or the interests of that communist led international communism that infects the entire Iberian sphere Elites and neocommunism reach out in forums such as Davos or in that globalist agenda the 2030 Agenda which wants to end meat consumption and which absurdly criminalizes farmers and livestock farmers saying that they are the cause of climate change and pollution an agenda that has been signed by consensus all the parties of this Congress all but VOX Your consensus is depopulation ruin corruption demographic winter lack of profitability and closure of farms as we are seeing in Castile and León where the agrarian weight is ten times above the national average Livestock and farmers are no longer able to cope with your constraints and production costs They 're mobilizing all over Spain The pressure we put them to is untenable as happened yesterday in Lorca Our solidarity with the national agricultural sector and our constant thanks for feeding the Spaniards It is necessary for the Spaniards to be aware that these herrings against livestock agriculture our gastronomy or against our productive system are

#RicardoChamorroDelmo,Thank you Madam President Ladies and gentlemen more than twenty days ago I warned Minister Planas at his appearance in the Commission that the food dependence of Spain and the European Union on third countries such as Russia or Ukraine currently at war on products as basic as cereals would be fatal for our food supply and could produce hunger in Europe We have insisted on the defense of national food sovereignty since we arrived at Congress and our insistence was answered from the beginning by all groups including the People 's Party insulting us calling us autarchic or anti-European We have called for the urgent removal and immediate repeal of the 2030 Agenda and any international agreement or legislation that blames our producers for environmental problems while exempting the real culprits On 9 March we asked the Minister to draw up a contingency plan and a new less green and more agricultural common agricultural policy which urgently encourages the production and strength of the agricultural sector recognizing its priority and strategic character Green demagogy or our children 's bread globalism or patriotism posture or food security Agricultural policy both national and European Union policy is inoperative As soon as it leaves producers helpless in theoretical situations of overproduction such as overnight it is intended that all kinds of food should be produced as a matter of urgency To top it off the so called crisis reserve is paid for by farmers The agricultural sector cannot react as if it were trying to open or close a key The costs are insurmountable The farmers who are ignored and caught closing their farms cannot return to the business as if they were trying to open or close a trade in the Gran Via Madrid Today we are in this motion with dozens of measures that we have complemented with our amendments We want to stress the apparent political turn of the party that is presenting it which calls even for the revision of the European Green Pact a party that has enthusiastically and without any kind of critical spirit the whole of the green architecture of the European Commission very much in line with its European People 's Political Group which is chaired by the Commission a party that drives the 2030 Agenda and renounces the productive capacity of our agriculture as it continues to do today in Brussels We agree with the vast majority of the concrete measures in your motion It 's never too late if the bliss is good We welcome the common sense here in Spain but we do not want it to happen as happened in the health crisis where transporters farmers farmers and fishermen were the heroes of the first line but as soon as the crisis has relaxed they have become by the progressive consensus ultras and intransigent simply because they cannot continue to work to lose money for the costs of production energy and fuel caused by the policies of this government They 're ultras of your children 's bread We want real and sustained commitments over time not patches a real strategy in defense of profitable and productive agriculture the only formula for sustainability and food sovereignty We want the government to urge the European Commission to curb green demagogy and to take into account the negative warnings of the scientific report drawn up by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission itself We want to use trade as a complement and projection of our agricultural sector but with the necessary trade safeguards to protect our national agricultural sector so that they do not replace us We want a national hydrological plan that takes into account that water is a good thing for all Spaniards and that is fundamental to cohering the territory of the nation with irrigation and that the European funds do not go away for chiringuitos or for irrigation of our agricultural competitors in North Africa In short apart from foreign agendas we want to bet on our

#RicardoChamorroDelmo,Thank you very much Madam President Ladies and gentlemen this rule is a regulation which aims to consolidate the common agricultural policy a common agricultural policy which we have already said in various committees which is demagogic economically reduced and ruinous a CAP which aims to achieve environmental and climate objectives through a new approach based on the European Green Pact a fanatical and eco-radical pact signed by all of you and a CAP which increases a very difficult bureaucracy already to be fulfilled by farmers and farmers which they do not understand and which has absolutely terrified them We see them constantly in the Spanish countryside and they tell us every day that it complicates their work In addition production costs continue to rise and the implementation of the farm 's objectives at the table seriously harms the entire Spanish countryside It is a good thing that this parliamentary procedure has eliminated the ban on the burning of plant remains generated in the agricultural environment A victory in the face of the senseless urbanist radical echo that does not understand agricultural uses and puts nothing but obstacles to farmers for the benefit of these global green agendas made behind the back of the people by elites who have not stepped on the field in their lives Food sovereignty has been a priority of our parliamentary group since we entered the Congress of Deputies Food sovereignty is a term that both France and Italy with their new Minister of Agriculture Francesco Lollobrigida have included within the Ministries of Agriculture which are now called the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Sovereignty Why did they do it Because like VOX you 've realized that you have to defend yours The concept of food sovereignty that we defend in our parliamentary group is to strengthen the values of our food to bet on our primary agri-food sector and to strengthen our production system in the face of economic crises or catastrophes It is a concept that does not exclude trade or trade relations but seeks in that trade our international complementarity and projection without sacrificing our productive sectors or our national security Our productive sectors are absolutely threatened by the indiscriminate entry of products from third countries that exercise unfair competition because they do not comply with the rules to which we subject our producers in environmental matters in terms of quality or in terms of labour legislation We reject the European Union 's crushing of our farmers with this green bureaucracy while watering hundreds of millions of euros to third countries in both agriculture and irrigation We have as last example of this case the concession to Morocco of 120 million euros for the modernization of agriculture announced last week by our spokesman Jorge Buxade Morocco is a country denounced by the Spanish countryside to the anti-fraud office of the Union for non-payment of customs duties fraud in labelling and lack of traceability How good it would be to our Spanish farmers that 120 million are going to Morocco Since VOX we have not only warned the Government of the reality that comes with green demagogy in relation to our agricultural production sector but have repeatedly submitted reports to it drawn up by independent bodies such as the United States Department of Agriculture and the European Commission itself which made it absolutely clear that the Green Pact is ruining us Who supports green policies All of you except VOX The spokesman for the People 's Group asked us earlier how we have come to this situation For we have come to this situation because of the implementation of the policies especially of the People 's Group the Socialist Group and the rest of the groups There are many European countries that also openly question green suicide policies and as an example we have the conclusions of the five Visegrad Group Agriculture Committees which oppose among other things the European Commission 's legislative proposal on the use of chemical plant protection products as part of the Farm to Bureau Strategy which will end up crushing our farmers and their production The flat rate reduction of 50 of plant protection chemicals as proposed by the European Commission destroys the competitiveness of our agriculture and favours the import of food products from third countries is a real madness The minister told us yesterday that we had to be responsible for meeting the sustainability and eco-schemes of this new CAP and that we have a commitment to the world What about the commitment to Spain I ask the minister to look into the eyes of farmers and farmers and tell them not to commit themselves to their land not to commit themselves to the profitability of their farms not to commit themselves to their families and to commit themselves to the objectives of elites who have not chosen anyone at all and whose dark interests only benefit them Those who are irresponsible are all of you ruining a fundamental sector that puts food at the table of the Spaniards that takes care of our fields and that is having a very bad time because of your political decisions VOX rejects this consolidation of the CAP agreement through the strategic plan and calls for a substantial revision of the CAP because it is detrimental to the interests of the agricultural sector Faced with a rachitic and ruined Europe to which the globalist bureaucrats of salon and heel settled in Brussels and Strasbourg VOX wants a strong and competitive European agrarian space that faces global geopolitical and food crises and builds more sovereign and free European nations in the face of threats,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,34.664894,-16.90077,10,thank much madam president ladies gentlemen rule regulation aims consolidate common agricultural policy common agricultural policy

#MaríaMagdalenaNevadoDelCampo,Thank you President Ladies and gentlemen one more year this government allocates the entire expenditure line to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals but most people do not know what that is about the 2030 Agenda the Sustainable Development Goals so I will explain it On the one hand we have the UN summits the climate summit the population summit the education summit A number of conclusions are drawn from these summits and a global consensus is said to have been reached These conclusions are reflected in an agenda the 2030 Agenda which is the solution to all problems On the other hand the UN has a number of agencies the WHO which is dedicated to health UNESCO to education science and culture FAO to food and agriculture the WTO to trade and so on as precisely here the ministries twenty two Some have decided that the UN should act as the World Government it already has its agencies which at a certain point could act as if ministries were involved For example the WHO if there was a pandemic could be the World Health Ministry right Sounds like it to you does n't it So that a world government can exist what needs to be done is to homogenize the world because of course it is chaos that each has its own customs that each has its own religion culture Then there 's another problem and it's that 8 billion people are many people and how are so many people going to be handled Something must be done to handle them for example use a very effective tool the tool of fear because that goes very well for obedience The main excuse is the climate apocalypse The climate apocalypse serves absolutely everything Because moreover man is the culprit man is the culprit he is the only culprit for the climate to change So we 're going to have to change the whole crop system the whole livestock system and with that the whole food system the energy system the industry system we 're going to change the education system We must also reduce the population because so many people pollute a lot And what 's done First what they do is they impoverish us and then they promote abortion gender ideology they create mistrust between couples because all that goes very well to reduce the population Of course borders are very unfair because of course with rising temperatures more than 2 billion people are going to have to emigrate to fresher countries and we have to open borders in pairs because if not we are insolidarians The solution to all evils is in the 2030 Agenda It is a perfect plan to put an end to poverty for affordable energy for decent work and for all goodness but very little is said about the 169 goals that are hidden behind the seventeen goals 193 countries commit to this plan Spain signed this 2030 Agenda at the hands of the People 's Party in 2015 And what are we doing Well we 're turning the agenda into law Everything very sustainable and resilient very inclusive and very gender sensitive Right Irene Montero The one who refuses to obey this agenda or the one who denies the theses of globalism is a negationist and is out of the law Spain obeys because this agenda is designed to dictate the elites of the World Economic Forum those elites who who what a coincidence happen to have interests in the pharmaceutical industry in energy and in food and Pedro Sánchez loves to obey them because that of going to the World Economic Forum he loves they are all his friends What does it mean for Spain to obey this agenda It implies the deconstruction of the society we are seeing it implies an absolute transfer of national sovereignty it implies food dependence it represents the ruin of industry it means above all misery Spain presents general State budgets and allocates 100 per cent of expenditure to the implementation of Agenda 2030 Section 29 Social Rights and Agenda 2030 is an antisocial section and it is because social rights are being able to pay the price of energy and not pass a climate change law that will lead us to ruin and energy dependence A social right is a quality public health it is not neglecting the patients with ALS it is not abandoning the patients with cancer because the treatments are very expensive A social right is care for those who really need help it is not to consider women or the LGBT collective as disabled Social rights are the protection of children and adolescents it is not to cover up the abuse of minors Mrs Montero and it is not to whitewash pederasty Social rights is to help mothers roast forward it is not the promotion of abortion Social rights are a well attended maturity not euthanasia Social rights are safe streets not rapists on the streets Social rights is quality education not indoctrination for the imposition of a single thought Social law is to facilitate access to housing not to protect the Okupas Social rights are food and food sovereignty not hunger and dependence on other countries Social rights are human rights not animal rights Mrs Belarra absent as long as there is only one Spanish passing cold or hungry you have no right to allocate 1760 000 euros in the boost of the 2030 Agenda Minister absent we have the

#MaríaMagdalenaNevadoDelCampo,Thank you President Mrs.Belara we ask you to know what measures you are going to put in place to further advance your 2030 Agenda in addition to giving the money of the Spaniards first to impoverish Spain and then to go through Robin Hood 's life in reverse stealing from the Spaniards to give it to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation In addition to that Mrs Belarus we would like to know in order to be prevented what further measures you are going to put in place Let 's talk first about what the 2030 Agenda is The 2030 Agenda as you will know is born under the title of transforming our world 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Well that 's good The truth is that transforming our world sounds pretty good as long as that transformation is for the better not for making a world unsustainable You can change everything that does n't work but the things that do work Mrs. Belarus you have to leave them as they are We do not know who decided these changes and above all we do not know why they want to bring about so much change If we look at the agenda we see that it seems that the excuse is climate change but if we continue to research and analyze the 2030 Agenda it turns out that there are objectives on education on health on gender ideology on justice What does all this have to do with the weather emergency Mrs. Belarra If you ask who chose to make those changes the answer is that there is a global consensus For the truth Mrs Belarus I tell you one thing I know absolutely no one who has been asked about these changes introduced by the 2030 Agenda Of course if you mean that there is a consensus to put an end to poverty to zero hunger to health and well being to clean water and sanitation to decent work to economic growth of course there is a global consensus Everyone wants those things but do you really mean that alone Is the 2030 Agenda just about that We Mrs Belarus when we say that there is no consensus we refer to the recommendations of this agenda and to the goals that you and many other countries are turning into law It is impossible for there to be a global consensus for example in something like educating children in global citizenship I do n't know any father you 've asked if you wanted to educate your children in world citizenship especially because of course if you educate your child in world citizenship what about national citizenship Mrs. Belarus To educate in world citizenship we must renounce our homeland our roots our customs our traditions Do you think it is possible to pretend that a Japanese or an Australian for example have the same vital philosophy as a Spanish Because to me it seems no and you will directly attack just that traditions customs and rooting What a coincidence Above all we have heard from this very rostrum three times to say to three different people New world order Does that sound like you Mrs. Belarra I say this because it was neither me nor anyone from my parliamentary group it was Pedro Sánchez it was Minister Montero who just left and it was Gabriel Rufián It will have nothing to do with that new world order with its 2030 Agenda will it Mrs. Belarus because education for world citizenship new world order seems to have some kind of relationship And of course in order for a new world order to be imposed there will also have to be a global consensus and I do not think Mrs Belarus I do not think we all agree on everything Your ladies and gentlemen in general the People 's Party Podemos and the other independenceist platforms tell us that we are out of the law because we do not agree with the 2030 Agenda I have heard it many times from this rostrum and in the commissions You are out of the law I believed that in a democracy Mrs Belarra one could think differently but it seems not Every time we oppose the slogans of the globalist agenda they call us fascists xenophobes homophobes racists and I do n't know how many more things This Mrs. Belarus can't be understood I 've told you about the title of the 2030 Agenda but now I 'm going to be left alone in the preamble I 'm not going on I 'm going to the preamble The preamble to the agenda says that it aims to strengthen world peace within a broader concept of freedom And then Mrs Belarus why is there a closed debate Is it really to dispel the ideological aspects of this globalist agenda to be out of democracy Is dissension of the ideological aspects of this agenda really out of the law What then does that mean by a broader concept of freedom Mrs. Belarra Just the opposite like everything else Does assuming the global agenda without an option to disagree no longer resemble a dictatorship Mrs Belarra we do not take up the closed debates because there is a lot at stake because we need to talk about our borders because we need to talk about freedom of expression because we need to talk about private property because we need to talk about equality before the law because we need to talk about our language our customs our traditions our history the evil so called gender and we need to talk about identities personal identities and national identities and we need to talk about life and death Mrs Belarra The Spanish have the right to express their views and to decide on those issues that are decisive for their lives and above all have the right to express their views on those issues that are decisive for their children 's lives VOX does not accept this supposed consensus imposed by the World Economic Forum and the UN and does not accept it because these people are no one to decide on the lives of the Spaniards because in the World Economic Forum there is not a single autonomous with difficulties to reach the end of the month because in the World Economic Forum there is no uncertainty about pensions the price of light or the price of gas because there is no one in the World Economic Forum concerned about the shopping basket or the purchase of school material for their children and because the UN whose main mission was the maintenance of peace among nations has fifty seven armed conflicts in the world and is dedicated to getting into the lives of others and is dedicated to putting a global agenda in motion Another of the UN 's missions was the defence of human rights and it turns out that the UN now considers it a human right to crush a child in a maternal womb That 's why we do n't accept the 2030 Agenda because the 2030 Agenda is a wolf with lamb skin After the lamb of health they have hidden the wolf of death after equality the supremacy of women and other collectives after education indoctrination after affordable energy energy poverty after decent work the ERTE after economic growth inflation after the lamb of peace Mrs. Belarus they have hidden the wolf of war This agenda does not respond to patriotic interests it involves a planned destruction of our sovereignty our economy and the moral social and political order Mrs.Belara we ask you to ask what else your ministry is going to do especially to be prevented because as VOX warned from the beginning everything you propose is just the opposite result We were right Do n't you see everything 's going backwards Is there no hunger more than ever Is there no more poverty than ever Where is economic growth Where 's the decent work Have they managed to reduce the deaths of women from domestic violence And what about affordable energy By the way if you look at those countries that are not part of the 2030 Agenda you will see that their economy is much better than those that are But I know what you 're going to answer I know the virus Putin and the climate You are going to tell me that the climate has been responsible for the fires and that the impositions of the 2030 Agenda have nothing to do with it you are going to tell me that Putin is solely responsible for the price of gas and for the widespread price of commodities and of course he is going to tell me that the virus has generated the economic crisis and that it has nothing to do with the impositions of the 2030 Agenda It 's over Mrs. Belarra The world is turning to another direction Only this month Chile has kicked that globalist Constitution Italy has said that no to the 2030 Agenda and Spain sooner than later by the hand of VOX will also escape from the clutches of globalism Mrs. Belarus this agenda is a bad plan and has no good intentions We deserve rulers fully committed to the prosperity and well being of Spanish and non-governors dedicated to achieving global goals that go against our interests Abandon all hope of further progress towards the destruction of the family our customs and traditions Do not continue to make progress towards the ruin of industry trade fishermen farmers farmers and self employed Leave the children alone and get to work for the Spaniards who are paying them because Spain has not come here so that a millionaire club imposes a global dictatorship In Spain there is a social and patriotic movement called VOX full of women and men free solvent independent courageous willing to defend Spain until the last consequences women and men fully dedicated to the search for the common good And I end with a phrase from Thomas Jefferson The biggest patriot is the dissident because above the political interest what he wants is prosperity and freedom for the nation It 's patriot time Thank you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,39.679756,-9.974551,10,thank president mrs.belara ask know measures going put place advance 2030 agenda

#TomásFernándezRíos,Thank you Mr. President Mr Garzón another debate on budgets Enjoy it yourself because thank God this is definitely going to be the last one you 're going to live in where you are You know we 've been saying for a long time that you 're the minister of nothingness because ever since you were put in this government with a shoemaker you and the little boy with practically no skills that he runs we were clear that it was n't going to do any good Because look at that engineer at that little ministry that he 's been set up to have him parked there I do n't know whose idea it was they named him the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and it's also bad luck that right now it 's going to be consumption one of the reasons they 're going to end up with this government Because to you as a good communist elite who is I know that the problems of the middle class of the working class affect little but I will try to outline in a few seconds the horror film that many consumers in this country are living because they will surely have to choose this winter between being able to eat or being able to turn on the heating Look the price of gas has risen by 341 this year and according to the International Energy Agency it is possible that what remains of winter can even be doubled The electricity bill has risen almost twice as much in the year 2022 as in the rest of the European Union and we are paying right now one of the most expensive electricity prices in the countries in our environment The CPI of the shopping basket and I 'm not talking about luxury products has already risen by an average of 15 this year the largest increase in the last thirty four years and which will entail an additional cost of about 850 euros for each family And in the face of this disaster Minister what have you done as Minister of Consumer Affairs this year For he has launched a campaign to teach the Spaniards to keep the eggs in the fridge and has advised us without any scientific criteria that we only consume four a week he has called the parents to a toy strike to fight against sexist advertising he has recommended using second hand clothes let us not change the mobile to save the planet he has promoted sharing appliances with the neighbors to pollute less and he has even dared to tell us that those who criticized his campaign against meat what we had was a testosterone problem Mr Garzón in this cabinet of ministers created with altars by the autocrat you have usually won the title of inept major of the Government of Spain and look at that there were candidates And it is that really it has become a classic in a classic even in bars waiting for you to open your mouth to see which sector or which collective sinks And since you hold this honorary title of Minister of Consumer Affairs without a portfolio you could have expected at least that you would have made some gesture some initiative to hear some dissenting voice in the Council of Ministers something to earn the salary and that it would serve as a consolation to alleviate the drama of so many Spanish consumers and families but the truth is that you are here for what is and is worth which is basically like other ministries to spend on absurdities the money of all Spanish people by the way this year with these budgets of ruin 12 more than last year about 7 million more euros But you know what Do you know anything curious Do you want me to tell you where that 80 more is going to stop those 7 million euros more than you will have Mr Garzón and your entourage in the 2023 financial year Well yeah let 's think it over and you 'll be right That 80 per cent more budget is going to go to staff costs Of course at staff costs because the chollo is over and you have to place most of your friends that the desert crossing is going to be very long Mr Garzón the only thing you and your ministry have achieved during this parliamentary term has been to become a spurt of the worst of politics and a joke of very bad taste for most Spaniards a joke that by the way has come very dear to us during these years And with his incompetence his fanaticism and above all his verbal incontinence he has had the ability to put on a war footing each and every one of the basic pillars of our economy agriculture livestock industry trade tourism Mr. Garzón you have n't let yourself be a puppet I 'm telling you Because Socialists to see if you know once and for all that this is what is happening this is the clear example of what is happening when once again we put personal interests partisan interests before the interests of the Spaniards and in this case in your particular case Mr Garzón as unfortunately in so many others that we have had to witness during the debate we are having these days we see with amazement that it is the price of toll of quota to agree at any price Thus we invent a little chiringuite and put in front of a radical incompetent and eager for protagonism But do n't worry that as I 've already mentioned on some occasion in the end everything passes bill and this is a reason to add to a long list for which the Spaniards are going to send you and your partners all your partners directly to your home That is so as soon as you have enough decency to give them the floor to let them decide and convene elections that will allow us to start building everything that you have destroyed during these years Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,30.115942,-9.039779,10,thank mr. president mr garzón another debate budgets enjoy thank god definitely going last

#LuisGestosoDeMiguel,Good afternoon When we first saw this popular legislative initiative I must admit that we read it with great interest for affecting a matter as high a priority for VOX as the Mar Menor What seemed to be an innocent legislative initiative turned out to be an attack on the Constitution the most elementary laws and human rights a Bolshevik experiment to abolish with the always excuse of the environment the rule of law in one part of Spain and we assume that to extend it to the rest as I will explain below It considered it relevant to include previous presentations in this plenary on the same subject Throughout the Mediterranean there are only two geographical phenomena that unlike lagoons lakes or albuferas receive virtually all of their sea water one is the Chica Sea next to Melilla and the other is the Minor Sea in Murcia This uniqueness causes the Sea Minor to be subjected to two impacts On the one hand the human impact which is the least of them as I will explain later and which is due to two main causes tourism and agriculture which are not by far the greatest threat to the Minor Sea On the other hand the impact of nature is a factor that is in danger and it is one that can make the Minor Sea completely disappear and it is due to the problem of the constant landing of the gorges which communicate it with the Mediterranean and the ramblas resulting from the rivers and torrential rains I will try to explain all this problem that I have outlined and its solutions The Mar Menor has an area of 13 500 hectares and 630 cubic hectares of salt water an average depth of 4.4 metres although the maximum is slightly more than 6 These 630 cubic hectometers have the following flow on the one hand there are losses of water that evaporate Annually they are about 220 cubic hectometers which therefore would be the amount that must enter to keep its volume stable and that does not overflow or dry On the other hand with regard to the contributions of water they come from the Mediterranean 190 cubic hectometers through the gorges which thanks to the minister 's incompetence and the abandonment of functions of the government of the Moroccan PP are closing Rivers and rains contribute 20 cubic hectometres that carry 10 of suspended solids which cause a slow sedimentation that causes the coast to have stolen land from the sea especially in the area of El Algar and Los Alcázares and there are phenomena such as the Rame Tower formerly a watchtower of pirate attacks being already 2 kilometers inland 2 cubic hectometres are brought by the black waters mainly overflowing with municipal scrubbers and 8 cubic hectometres by the infiltration of agricultural irrigation What problems do these contributions present and how to deal with them The contribution of 190 cubic metres of the Mediterranean does not present any problems but it is essential for the Sea Minor not to dry out The 20 cubic hectometers of the rivers and their suspended solids do pose a problem of long term landing which can be solved as was done in Cartagena with the Rambla del Hondon which drowned the fishing port and diverted to the Mediterranean The 2 cubic hectometres of black water from PP and PSOE municipal sanitation are the most serious problem And we come to the 8 cubic hectometres of agricultural irrigation which are irrelevant and it is the excuse that this government was seeking and the consensus is progressing one to comply with its dogmatic agenda and another to throw balloons out to continue to chair and criminalize the farmers of Levante with useless and purposeless laws like the one they want to pass today By the way all groups of ecologists in the Murcia Region lied that farmers were guilty of the supposed degradation of the Lesser Sea because they poured 90 cubic hectometers at it The face of reality was given by the ministry itself and Tragsa with a demolishing study that reduced the catastrophic expectations of these groups by leaving it alone on 8 cubic hectometres Conclusion from VOX we propose the following solutions cheap fast effective and definitive irrefutable for VOX in any government or agreement First the opening of the throat and its maintenance at the levels of the fifties or sixties considered the golden age of the Mar Menor This government has closed it to create an alleged ecological hecatombe in an area where they do not govern and are guilty of the death of tons of fish who died looking for oxygen in the throat of Marchamalo which they had closed Secondly install mandatory rain separative sanitation in all PP and PSOE municipalities in the area which are the major culprits of what is spilled Thirdly the construction of a perimeter ditch around the Sea Minor whose preliminary draft we have already brought here which makes nitrate filter brine etc Fourthly draw up a zero salm plan allowing farmers to install ventilators to dispose of all these products And fifthly the diversion of the ramblas to the Mediterranean So far the simple quick and cheap solutions that VOX proposes in the face of its delirious totalitarian projects for this area of Spain such as the one they bring here today and which we will repeal in the next parliamentary term from the Government of Spain There are already many state autonomous and even European administrations with competence over the Mar Menor and the adjacent territory of its basin as well as public actions in the field of urban planning and the environment for the reporting and prosecution of possible crimes against ecological heritage as well as the use of the Prosecutor 's Office the Seprona etc. which make this initiative a toast to the sun This ILP is more wasteful and more legislation rather than managing well with existing instruments and without increasing public spending There is no more pretension than to create a new anti-democratic and totalitarian chiringuito that operates outside the laws and the suffrage of the Spaniards as I will explain below The first time I was aware of this initiative was in Murcia in the square of Santo Domingo when a group of people collected signatures to save the Sea Minor A crowd gathered around the table lent themselves in good faith led by good intentions to sign that request for help to save this unique enclave without further proof of what they were signing I had the occurrence of asking and I was stunned when I was told what the signatures were for to give legal personality to the Mar Menor I thought it was such nonsense that I continued to walk thinking that such a legal misconception would have no way until today that they bring here this nonsense dressed in popular initiative supported by all the ruling extremism and the shameful submission of the People 's Party to the suspension of the rule of law in this area of Spain depending on it among other rights private property and free enterprise As nothing that has happened lately in the Minor Sea is innocent I saw that they repeated the typical left wing move that we have seen so many times in this Parliament to present extreme left wing activists as independent technicians in the matter to be discussed We saw it in the Commission of the COVID when the independent expert was nothing less than Monica García of More Madrid and here they repeat played They catch a specialist person also dressed as an independent expert together with other people all known activists of Podemos and try to bring back the deception that what is presented here is a peremptory necessity and a social demand endorsed by scientists when it is nothing more than an attempt to create a new chiringuito dominated by the extreme left to steal funds to squander our pockets and take advantage of the good faith of citizens escaping any democratic control I fully agree with you on one thing that you say in the explanatory statement that all measures all ideological laws all attempts to perpetuate the problem in order to fill themselves with the subsidies proposed by the left the anti-system ecologists and the progress consensus have served no purpose And to avoid it they bring us another chiringuito like all those who have been creating for decades so far in the form of expert groups observatories and other words As I said moreover it is a legal nonsense but you who teach VOX about democracy do not care very much because you skip the laws to the bullfighter as in this case article 35 of the Civil Code and a comprehensive and profuse Spanish and European legislation that invalidates your proposal without entering into all the terrible for the freedom it hides In its proposal they question the rule of law by saying that environmental law no longer serves to protect nature and that alternatives to the law which is the foundation of the democratic state must be sought They give rights to the Mar Menor which is similar to when Caligula wanted to appoint his horse Incitatus consul of Rome I guess we 'll soon see him listed for voting or signing contracts at the Mar Menor itself They create chiringuitos where they have the decision making majority about the environment people like you who do n't answer to anyone about their management and stuff themselves with our money The rights of fish crustaceans plants organisms and the different elements that integrate and interact are fundamental to you in equality or superiority in relation to the exercise of fundamental human rights in the area To be equal in rights to animals to be devoid as they have done in other legislative nonsense of any vestige of humanity of any value to the miracle of man 's life of everything that makes us exceptional and unrepeatable and underpins the freedom and democracy of each of us to be equal in rights and obligations to plants and pets If we leave them we will soon see a cat or a horse voted with the Mar Menor in that collective madness in which they find themselves Laws in which it is cheaper to haul a machete to a human being than to cut off the ear for hygiene to a pet You use the Sea Minor for your globalist plans and climate agendas which prohibit transfers That is why they want to ban agriculture in the Minor Sea to close de facto the transfer of the Tagus because simply they no longer have any land to water VOX will always denounce their manipulations and attacks on freedom Only VOX can close your bars and quickly solve the problems of the Sea Minor that all of you have created on the basis of bad faith incompetence or cowardice and we will do so without the agency of placement of incompetents who slip our pockets because only VOX is left Thank you,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,34.877983,-9.676033,10,good afternoon first saw popular legislative

#LuisGestosoDeMiguel,"Good afternoon This motion is the result of an amendment to the budgets within the so called Framework for Priority Actions for the Recovery of the Sea Minor With it they intend first to create a technical office for the conservation of this enclave with millionaire endowment and that they say it will be composed in principle by two officials and public enterprises but later on they already speak of contracted personnel that I imagine it will be composed of their usual associates and it will be another agency of placement of plugs and another unusable chiringuito more than will fix only the pocket of its graceful components They speak of subjecting their operation to the totalitarian ILP of the Mar Menor that we will take to the courts because it is an attack on the Constitution and the freedom and only aims to carry out a communist experiment with which to abolish freedom in that part of Spain by means of a chiringuito dominated by the extreme left and by characters and associations that do not present themselves to the elections to govern the legal personality of the Mar Menor and by the way its municipalities apart from the Government the administrations and the popular vote abolishing private property because they intend to make them houses of the beach an administrative concession and freedom of enterprise consecrating the disparate that ecosystems and animals are on equal rights with man who ceases to be the protagonist of the laws which are humanized Human life is devalued relativized as in all its laws This is the emergency they 're talking about This chiringuito will study in 2023 the deadlines for the implementation such as the framework of priority actions of the Government which are so high priorities that they need a chiringuito to see if they have begun two years after announcing them with great propaganda And finally if you finish the previous bicoca your plug in will continue to operate to spread what they call the Mar Menor brand But the proof that you 've never stepped on the Lesser Sea is when you end up saying that your goal is to close the artificially created gorges to avoid what you call sweetening Given the chiringuito and its intention to end the gorges I 'm going to give the keys to what the climate emergency is or I do n't know what they call it the Sea Minor Of the 630 cubic metres of the Sea Minor they are lost by evaporation and filtration every year 220 cubic metres and only by the gorges 190 cubic metres enter If we do the nonsense they say it 'll dry out in less than four years That 's a climate emergency but it 's getting them out of the government as soon as possible too With the closure of the gorges which are the canals linking the Mediterranean with the Lesser Sea which you opened and regenerated and which today you have closed and whose key has swallowed the minister you intend to artificially create an environmental hecatombe turning the Lesser Sea into a sunbathing with its green waters for lack of circulation That minister who never comes to the things of the Mar Menor being secretary of state with the government of Zapatero dredged in 2011 the golad Marchamalo with the joy of the director general of Sustainability and secretary general of the Communist Party in Murcia Pedro Antonio Ríos who boasted of the positive that it was for the Mar Menor to have cleaned the throat and reused its 22,000 cubic meters of sand in regenerating the beaches That 's how you spend it coherently Secondly with the closure of the gorges and the artificially created hecatombe with elabonan never better said the criminalization of Murcian agriculture They blame farmers for their negligence in managing to dismantle their farms and create a subsidized economy of captive voting in the area because they no longer give up Thirdly they intend to eradicate this agriculture from the Cartagena countryside by abolishing the transfer of the Tagus by the way of the facts since it would no longer be necessary to have no fields to water The problem is that the People 's Party remains its counterpart Therefore in just one year we will rule in Murcia and Spain we will abolish its liberticid laws and close its chiringuitos we will open the gorges as in the sixties we will make a perimeter filtration ditch we will impose separational sanitation we will eliminate the brine and we will divert the ramblas to the Mediterranean Because there 's only VOX left and more Spaniards know it every day Thank you very

#FerreroRoberta,Mr President ladies and gentlemen this is the last decree law to be converted by this Parliament It 's all very singular and unreleased We are in the election campaign everything is very fast and the period is worrying I refer in particular to the crisis especially of an economic nature My personal opinion is that today we must demonstrate more than ever our seriousness and our sense of responsibility by converting an important decree- law which is worth over 17 billion euros The Lega Group has worked on improving issues left unresolved by the decree with the submission of amendments and trying to share common themes with the other groups We have strongly proposed solutions to the problems of superbonus 110 In particular mediation has enabled us to reach agreement on the amendment on joint responsibility which is the crucial issue that has blocked the transfer of tax credit to households and businesses At least this problem will be resolved here in this House Our amendments accepted in the Commission contain simplification measures in the area of exceptional transport and installation of photovoltaic systems as well as provisions in favour of the municipalities Of course much remained outside the decree I am thinking in particular of the issue of drought which could be addressed here However I hope that the appeal on the agenda on which the Government has committed itself will be accepted in the next aid decree Let us return to Parliament 's responsibility in converting the decree which let us not forget contains measures which are certainly inadequate but necessary I would like to point out that this measure extended the 30 cent discount on fuel excise duties to 20 September It will be little but who this summer has been in countries like Spain and France has been surprised positively that there the fuels cost and cost just 30 cents more than Italy In addition the cancellation of the system charges on household bills was extended to the fourth quarter Also in this case it may be a small measure in the sense that we know very well that the household bills have increased enormously but if you do not convert this decree also decays this measure that still goes to help the families The social bonus for electricity and gas has also been strengthened even though we have learned what we know For this reason my appeal to Parliament is always to be concrete going to see the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulations that are adopted here In the real world this measure faces great difficulties because families have problems obtaining it because of the ISEE communication mechanism paradoxically in fact it is automatic only for citizens income recipients while families have great difficulty getting this bonus The possibility for companies to provide corporate benefits of up to 600 euros has also been raised This is good because wages and salaries are losing purchasing power very quickly Our idea which I also expressed in an amendment that I proposed is to be able to combat inflation and to act accordingly on the tax wedge giving the employer the opportunity to provide tax free increases I mean that when a company spends 100 euros on an increase it is impossible for the worker to receive about 40 euros in the paycheck So you have to think about taxing what you want to give the worker extra They are all measures that can be improved but we can not do without them With another amendment we had asked to give a further possibility of remission of the deferred payment of the maxirate at the end of July of the scrap-b We have also proposed to eliminate the deadline of 30 September as regards the superbonus 110 on the villas These are all measures which the next so called aid b measure should take into account I would just like to end by saying that it takes a great deal of sense of reality at the moment with respect for families and businesses that really see inflation rampant The government must therefore find solutions to this situation which I would venture to call dramatic In conclusion I would like to thank all my colleagues offices Commissions 5a and 6a and their respective Presidents for the great work they have done over the years,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,F,27.71568,-16.186306,10,mr president ladies gentlemen last decree law converted

#VallardiGianpaolo,"Mr President I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak about an issue which is certainly on the agenda of all citizens namely the debate on food in these days I take this opportunity to greet and thank on behalf of the Government the Undersecretary Centinario who together with Minister Patuanelli has been working on this subject for some time I would like to say that we are working on a very important subject the one we are debating today the nutri-score and the ten year Farm to Fork plan It is this new vision of food and how to consider respect for the environment from here to the next deadlines seen by the European Commission The European Commission wants us to reduce emissions into the atmosphere often and willingly by blaming farmers and a little bit of food in our country which they are calling into question with the nourishing score I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on Agriculture because we have achieved a sharing and it has not been very difficult to do so I warmly thank all its components one by one because everyone in a unanimous way has signed the commitment to go against the form of labelling let 's call it that of the nutri-score with which we Italians with our Made in Italy and our Mediterranean diet have absolutely nothing to do with it 17.08 Followed by Mr Vallardi Our initiative is to safeguard the great quality of the production of our farmers to which my compliment really goes because we are the country of biodiversity in Italy I remember that we have over 7,000 edible plant species We therefore do not understand why with the nourishing score often and willingly our products are labeled with the red bubble The emblematic case is that of olive oil which initially got the red bubbles and now the orange bubbles I can understand that if we drink a liter of olive oil it probably hurts us but if we use a spoon or two we know and we have always known that it does us very well Perhaps also for this reason we can understand why with the Mediterranean diet and especially with Made in Italy we are perhaps the longest lived country in the world I say perhaps because we are little exceeded by Japan that as longevity exceeds us perhaps a year and not more If we are the second country in the world for longevity it means that we eat well that the made in Italy must definitely be safeguarded and that the nourishing score has absolutely nothing to do with our food system I would like to make these quick comments to the Government because I am convinced that it will follow us in this initiative firstly because we are right secondly because the Committee on Agriculture has proved to be as compact as ever thirdly because if we are all united in a granite way and we are all working in one direction perhaps we can come up with it in relation to the European Commission which I would like to remind you did not allow citizens to eat crickets more than a month ago after allowing worms and grasshoppers to eat You understand then that perhaps the European Commission is on the wrong track Already in advance I would like to thank all those who will join this motion I hope that we will all work in one direction which is to enhance the great work and quality of the products of Italian farmers all of which must be defended together",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini

#VallardiGianpaolo,VALLARDI L SP PSd Az Mr President I greet the Undersecretary Centinario the Government and all my colleagues present at the debate on the resolution on issues relating to the minimum vital flow of rivers and streams important for the world of agriculture but above all for the environment I would really like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for their work Yes we voted unanimously but the subject is not at all simple As we have heard from the speeches in general but also from the explanations of vote it is not a simple subject on the one hand there is the survival of the world of agriculture and on the other hand the will of the many ecologists who in my opinion rightly want an ever better environment It is clear that there is water flowing in our rivers at stake it is not an absolutely simple subject at a very difficult and very delicate time of climate change which we have been hearing about for several years now We listen to a lot of discussions on this issue and a lot of people say that we have to fight climate change I do n't think we can fight climate change but we have to manage it something quite different This must be done absolutely because Italy among the European countries is perhaps the most affected by climate change We have seen them we are suffering them in the world of agriculture there are so many damages that our farmers and our farmers have suffered in recent years but the worst of the problems is the increase in drought in our territories About 20 of our territories a very important figure are at risk of desertification Given the lack of water flow in our rivers the salt wedge is climbing making it very difficult to cultivate land near the mouth of the river and therefore the sea We need to better manage the water resource in our country I remember that in Italy over the entire surface about 300 billion cubic meters of water fall every year There are many but we have a significant problem we cannot contain even 10 percent of these 300 billion cubic meters of water not even 30 billion cubic meters because we do not have water works and invaded enough to contain this water It would be very simple to have the water available and then be able to irrigate the fields but we are not able to manage the water resource What then I think it 's also quite simple almost elementary to solve the problem We must intervene economically as stated by the National Association of Consortiums for the management and protection of the territory and irrigation waters Anbi which I would like to thank for the great work it has done A work that we also did in the Committee on Agriculture with the survey on the water situation of all Italian consortia We have a leopard spot situation which is generally sufficient However we have understood from this resolution that a lot of money must be invested We have not invested many I address the Government represented here by the Undersecretary Centinario but Minister Patuanelli certainly knows that the money we have made available for the irrigation of our territory for the invaders is not at all sufficient We have not allocated a billion euros between the PNRR and the last budgetary manoeuvre we have put 960 million in order to manage the invaders in the country while it would take four times as much I believe that we must consider this calmly on everyone 's part I remember the fairy tale of Esopo 's cicada and ant in this country we are perhaps a little too cicadas we spend a little too much money in things that can also be useful but we cannot give them to everyone indiscriminately and then where they actually serve as for agriculture the money available is not there There is what I personally think is a fairly simple mathematical equation agriculture plus water gives us food but the same does not happen without water and we absolutely need food today more than ever The bad facts that are happening in the war between Russia and Ukraine have made us understand how much we need agriculture in this country they have made us aware of how much Italy does not have self sufficiency for food supply We must recover food sovereignty in this country they ask us to produce more corn they ask us for more grain because we discovered that we mainly imported soft wheat almost completely from Russia or Ukraine However how can we ask ourselves to do more agricultural production when we do not have enough water for everyone That little water we have available if we contend with civil use our aqueducts and our people and I remember how much we must invest in the aqueduct system of water management since in the national average more than 30 of the water consumed by our citizens before being consumed is dispersed because the pipelines are broken and lose 30 or 40 percent of the aqueducts depending on where they are are broken You have to invest it is easy to recover water We need to invest in agriculture 4.0 we need to invest in new irrigation methods we need to invest in invades because the water in our country comes yes I will always remember the 300 billion cubic meters of water but at the wrong time it comes too much when we do n't need it and then when we need it we do n't have it It is therefore very simple to solve the issue money is needed Before concluding my speech I would like to reflect on a debate that we had in the Committee on Agriculture when it was said that we would not present any other draft legislation because it was running out of time for the legislature Well I think we have time to get the money back I can think of the famous coach Vujadin Boskov who says that the game ends when the referee whistles Here let 's think about this In my opinion before the end of the parliamentary term whistle arrives we must absolutely find the money to invest in the world of agriculture on irrigation in favour of all our farmers That is why the Lega Group will vote in favour of the measure,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,30.807554,-14.250762,10,vallardi l sp psd az mr president greet undersecretary centinario government colleagues present debate

#DeCarloLuca,Mr President I personally and the whole of the Brothers of Italy Group are extremely pleased that we are finally talking about nutri-scores without us bringing this issue to the attention of the public and of Parliament The other two times both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate the appeal had come from the opposition It is pleased that this time it is a Senate Commission that understands its importance and submits to the House a document that gathers the will of all political forces no one excluded to put an embankment not only ideological but also scientific to this absolute nonsense of the streetlight label that someone would like to pass as a scientific We had denounced it already a year and a half ago and brought to the attention a few months ago and today it is finally the heritage of the whole Assembly and political forces how absolutely anti-Italian and against Italian products this subtle attempt disguised as protection of public health Moreover objectively we have seen many attempts to exploit public health also in Italy and we have not had to wait for the European Commission or a part of the European nations to realize that this use of health is being used a little bit when there are no arguments and health is the only glue that allows political forces to maintain their status Now focusing on the Farm to Fork strategy we would not only have a direct criticism of the nourishing score but also something to say about certain more ideological than useful attestations such as those that the Farm to Fork document states We have denounced from the first moment the placing of constraints on Europe without looking at what nations do much more polluting and less attentive to the environmental issue which are among other things those to which in the coming years we should think about how to feed There is a clear contradiction which strikes quite a bit between the rules that we self impose in Europe to protect the environment and the exponential increase of the population around the world In fact even if we respect the environment as much as we need to start to feel like something that is one with us and not something third compared to us we have to ask ourselves how we can then feed a population of the world that is growing absolutely Otherwise we risk writing beautiful pages of anthology and philosophy and then not being able to make sure that all even the countries we call today in the developing world are able to develop as our thousand year old European civilization has managed to do in recent years I am talking about this because it seems clear to me that there has been more ideology than innovation in the document before us more attention to the merely consensual aspect than to a true and in depth analysis of what food production should be and above all what should be at their base namely agriculture I 'm a little out of the nourishing score theme I remember in fact that the nourishing score did not generate great interest today because we all realized the importance of healthy food It has not risen to the honours of the news because in this it has read a strong penalty of the agricultural sector which among other things would translate in the immediate but simply because this instrument penalizes the entire Italian supply chain from agriculture to those who make exports from the houses of transformation to those who care to maintain the territory Here we have succeeded as a nation system and not only through politics It is true that Brothers of Italy brought the theme to the attention of the Assembly but it is equally true that there are people in the Ministry who have sounded the alarm bell on the subject since 2018 Therefore we who would like to boast that we were the first to raise the issue do not realize that inside the Ministries there were already people who knew of the danger of what was happening and they are the same people who are helping us to clearly manifest the antiscientific nature of these operations but also the solution This is perhaps the first bell that should ring that is to say that we have such professionalism in Italy today that not only allow us to warn the danger first but even allow us with the elaboration and with the help of so many private companies to elaborate the answer to these problems The nutrinform battery is in fact the answer to these problems and is the result of the great participation of all the political subjects of all the technical subjects and also of private subjects that have made themselves available Federal the University of Luiss all people who built our position against the nutri-score If it had been a merely political position of opposition between states and between nations most likely the interests that have dominated until now those nations in which the nutri-score has flourished would have massacred us from the point of view of scientific evidence Today however we must thank the great technical work we have done in the Ministries I thank the Undersecretary Centinario for thanking in this case the entire structure Clearly someone must have the intellectual honesty to tell you things when they do n't work but to tell you that we Nazione Italia regardless of who is in the government today can count on absolutely valid professionalism To these however we must add other professionalism that allows us a higher step that is to increase innovation in agriculture to return to the yields of 1984 to cite a classic example that I always remind everyone In the year in which the farmer was painted as in the famous film by Pozzetto Il gioco di campagna in Italy the production per hectare of corn was higher than that of the United States It means that programming and innovation had been done by someone in previous years dragging them to the 1980s Today we must start from there from that concept of innovation which does not mean forgetting tradition but simply means having the tools to bring agriculture back to the level it deserves that is to a primary sector not only in name but also in general consideration Also because clean and sustainable agriculture is what our farmers already do gentlemen Wanting to take something for example we should not apply methods that resemble those that are used whenever the Ministry of Economy and Finance intends to make an intervention on the Municipalities that is the famous linear cuts that regardless of what the savings of the mayors have been are penalized both the good ones and those that as they say have not beaten a nail and for ten years perhaps have financed the potato festival every year constantly increasing its resources I see the same thing on the agricultural front we cut and demand from all the same decrease for example the use of plant protection drugs when we all know that Italy is the sixth country in the world for the gradual use of plant protection drugs I do not know one farmer who poisons his own soil in full awareness of the fact that the next year he has to go back to work on it no one kills himself in agriculture However there are even more global challenges such as climate change which must enable our farmers to have those instruments even chemical ones unfortunately for a share until we find a natural system that replaces the chemical system As when a human body is ill even a plant even a field even a cultivation need interventions which are chemical for the first part and then transform into natural interventions as soon as science and research allow it This is where we have to go back to investing chemistry research innovation in order to bring agriculture back not to the Heidi period but to a respect for the land proper to our tradition but that today must be combined with a strong innovation which must bring back,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,34.765587,-18.887867,10,mr president personally whole brothers italy group extremely

#DeCarloLuca,The Ukrainian decree-law whose name is absolutely improper actually drags problems that are prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and it is probably the attempt to remedy at least towards public opinion twenty years of poor wrong or absent programming in the field of energy where a series of nos which we still see repeated and disconnected from the absolute reality of the facts have heavily conditioned the past energy policy of the nation No to drills before no to nuclear even before perhaps if it made sense in the eighties now we can safely free from any ideology sit down at a table and realize the energy policy of a nation without preconceptions and without ideological positions that then condition our dependence on other sources for twenty years The ecological transition is excellent Who is more environmentally friendly than someone who deals with the environment and therefore agriculture I do n't think so This is why the waste cycle in agriculture must be closed through agricultural products following all the rules to safeguard public health I do n't think anyone can question that But the fact that the cycle of rejection and the circular economy pass also through the valorization of what then agriculture leaves is an absolutely objective fact it is part of ecology and it is what happens normally in nature All these repeated nos have put us in a condition of great dependence also from the exquisitely agricultural point of view so much so that the important increases of fertilizers 170 percent of the feed 90 percent of the diesel 129 percent strongly condition our enterprises that they will find only a limited benefit compared to the burdens that they will suffer To say it is not Luca De Carlo who could be accused of partisanship because he is one of the senators who are in opposition but a report of the Agricultural Research Council and the analysis of the agricultural economy Crea according to which 30 of farms will have a negative income Before the crisis of these prices which is before the invasion of Ukraine only 7 of farms had a negative income Among other things there are great differences between the granivore farms which make great use of feed such as pig farming and perhaps even cereal farms compared to other farms I remind everyone that dairy farms for example are remarkably on their knees Many farmers today have chosen not to start the production cycle because they consider it uneconomical and do not buy pigs to make pigs All this in an already very difficult context arising from the problem of swine fever virus Among other things it has been known since 2014 that it would also land in Italy especially after the first evidence in Eastern Europe This problem was given a limited response with poor programming without going to the heart of the question concerning the containment of the number of wild boars that were the true viaticum of transmission of the virus I would remind everyone first of all to myself that the Senate Agriculture Committee itself had tabled a resolution to contain the number which was voted on last year well in advance of when swine fever occurred I leave aside the considerations of those who see a wild boar feeding their puppies in the center of Rome giving it a bucolic and almost affective vision seeing it as a form of restoration by the nature of the spaces that man has taken from it That is the failure of environmental policies because a wild boar forced to wander in the waste of the city center is a wild boar that no longer has a space on which to live in its natural environment So we can't pretend that the cause has become the problem That is where we should act but I repeat we must act not with the belly but with the programming It is not the immediate consensus that will give answers to energy and agricultural policies It 's programming what 's good for the nation today What we decide today could be unpopular but it could also be what our children will need in 20 years time So let 's stop running behind the easy consensus of those who like most on a post and focus on what needs to be structural interventions We certainly cannot do this alone it is true but we must do it in Europe with what has hitherto been a political dwarf and a bureaucratic giant that has not facilitated the national states but indeed has put the poles in the way of their development I am referring to those who have decided knowingly that we should no longer produce in Europe especially in the agricultural sector and that raw materials should be bought where they were cheaper and the same policy as the one that dismissed this attitude as naïve This was not a naïve attitude but the failure of twenty years of agricultural policies in Europe which also heavily influenced our producers Think of the question of milk quotas which are now the subject of an amendment to this measure Our requirements are only covered by 85 of domestic production 15 is milk we take from abroad How is it possible that programming was right How is it possible that to date the value of that milk is paid in an anti-economic way A study of the Crea shows that the cost of producing a litre of milk is 46 cents of euro this before the war in Ukraine while the one that was cleared under normal conditions except where there are DOP productions such as Grana Padano is between 38 and 39 cents of euro Is this a sale below cost Yes it is Is this a system that can structurally stand No it 's not Doing these interventions is almost like trying to shovel evil with a glass without acting structurally where there are our great shortcomings I believe that the great structural reforms can be done not with a government within which there is everything and the opposite of everything but only with a government whether on the one hand or on the other that has a clear agenda a vision of the world over the next twenty years We do not need a government that follows the consensus or worse still the maintenance of its status quo,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,33.943104,-15.604747,10,ukrainian decree-law whose name absolutely improper actually drags

#DeCarloLuca,"Mr President I begin my speech with a political consideration I like Senator Ferrari believe that a national strategic plan to address such an important issue as water must be done with a strong and legitimate government Therefore I invite the Movimento 5 Stars to maintain the position and to pull the plug on this Government so that you can go and vote and finally have a government serious and legitimated by the ballot box So we 're perfectly on the line In order to return to the subject of information and I thank the Minister for his always precise and timely participation in the work of the Assembly it would seem strange that a nation like ours where there is more rain in Europe and there are more waterways we should discuss a water crisis We have 7.596 streams 1,242 of which are rivers and we have 342 lakes not to mention the fact that the Italian peninsula is bathed on three sides by seawater with the opportunity therefore to act as they do in certain parts of the world in which salt water is transformed into fresh water to be used for many purposes However this water crisis is only part of the crisis that is affecting agriculture today partly because perhaps the strongest blow that has been struck by our farmers has been the increase in traction costs those relating to fuels which have seen fishing and agriculture as a real waste on which we have not yet managed to put a piece of equipment and which sees the great concern of their operators The problem of the water crisis is also a major one because 85 of agri -food production comes from irrigation crops I remember that the use of water for agricultural purposes exceeds 60 while that of industry and energy is 25 and civil use as Mr La Pietra rightly mentioned is between 10 and 15 By the way at a time such as this ecological transition supposed or at least begun the water resource represents 40 of the green energy of this nation But precisely because of the drought energy losses are estimated or in any case decreases of an equally 40 thus placing a problem of type not only irrigation to the crops but also energy I say this among other things as mayor of a coastal municipality a municipality that has a portion of the lake for which it emerges annually the difficulty to match all the requirements from the water point of view the industrial one the tourist one the food one and the agricultural one Every year mountain lakes are severely penalized by a form of withdrawal a little for agriculture and a little for energy demonstrating how the blanket is already short during normal years and not only during the years of the crisis He rightly mentioned the Minister in 2003 2007 and 2017 almost a five year plan which is actually missing from us partly because drought or rather drought problems has caused damage for about 15 billion in the last twenty years Today there is the ballet about the cost of the water problem of 2022 the Minister cites 3 billion some 4.5 billion but in short it is of this order with sectors penalized much more than others think about the conditions of rice in Biellese and Vercellese but also in the Po Delta Products such as Carnaroli rice Arborio and others are clear examples not only of excellence but also of biodiversity whose valorization and care are one of the objectives we have set ourselves not only for environmental but also economic purposes in order to enhance those products that cannot be replicated in another part of the world The problem is wide and the premise I have made demonstrates it but the many speeches by my previous colleagues and above all that of the Minister also demonstrate it Therefore given the premises it should also be possible to give concreteness to the possible operations that we should do in order at least to try to alleviate the situation out of about 4.5 billion PNRR only 400 million are dedicated to new invaders which according to many operators including large trade associations and agricultural associations would represent a good start to make sure not only to have water always available but even to reverse that trend that Italy sees resounding taillight compared to those nations that manage to use the waters Veneto even my region is the one that has the ability to recover water only at 5 even 7 points below the national average And this is a huge problem especially for a region with a strong agricultural vocation Then there are the millions destined for the modernization and efficiency of irrigation systems In recent years it has been farmers who have made innovations on these systems It is also true that in our country there are not only large farmers there is also a galaxy of small entrepreneurs who may not be able because of the size of their company to access this type of contribution and therefore to improve their efficiency I say all this because in Italy there are already 526 dams and 20,000 small invaders However despite such a deployment of forces and realities the national average of the retained waters is only 11 Minister in my opinion you should try to beat your fists a little bit in Europe in order to be able to increase the resources of the Next generation EU and achieve greater flexibility with regard to state aid In fact between de minimis and other issues farmers despite being able to benefit from certain contributions do not actually land them In a nation then with an exposure on the coasts so large there is then to counter the salt wedge that is the phenomenon for which inside our rivers enters for 20 kilometers salt water thus depriving the irrigation capacity of the lands that are found near that water of a strong numerical component We should therefore implement the construction of anti-salt barriers consider finally the desalitors and understand through the studies of the nations that have already made them if it is now convenient and what the price will be that we will have to pay to have fresh water through the use of salt water There are experiments in this sense In Israel they have been doing this for a long time and diplomacy should work there to have available the technology that we do not have today and to realize with a mathematical calculation whether this is feasible or not All of our colleagues have focused on precision agriculture We must succeed in spending less and cultivating more We must increase production and not reduce it as the Farm to fork would like but at a lower cost The ecological transition is done through technological improvement and not through the happy decline Another important step is the recovery of rainwater We can't imagine this nation without a serious rainwater recovery program Minister we have put so many proposals on the table some of which are already on your agenda You unlike us have a chance to put them on the ground Do it not for you or this government but for the nation 's sake",#group.FdI,Fratelli

#DeCarloLuca,DE CARLO FdI Mr President our vote is absolutely in favour of this measure especially in view of the fact that those who speak come from a Province such as Belluno which does not have the possibility of intensive agriculture but which enjoys benefits and benefits from this law which in fact puts all small farmers and producers in a position to have aid and support It seems paradoxical however that today we are dealing with these albeit important issues when we have a national problem which is more related to supply self sufficiency and independence than to details such as those that can be zero kilometer rather than anything else I appeal to the Undersecretary I know that he is particularly sensitive to these issues so that we can really bring the church back to the centre of the village and put the primary sector back in that strategic and primary place that agriculture deserves but which deserves above all our agri-food industry which benefits most from our agriculture I would remind you dear Undersecretary that when you decide or make any kind of proposal which will go towards a greater form of independence and also a new vision of agriculture that puts innovation alongside tradition you will always find the Brothers of Italy Group as in this case favorable,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,32.7425,-18.785168,10,de carlo fdi mr president vote absolutely favour measure especially view fact speak come province belluno possibility intensive agriculture enjoys benefits benefits law fact puts small farmers producers position aid support seems paradoxical however today dealing albeit important issues national problem related supply self sufficiency independence details zero kilometer rather anything else appeal undersecretary know particularly sensitive issues really bring church back centre village put primary sector back strategic primary place agriculture deserves deserves agri-food industry benefits agriculture would remind dear undersecretary decide make kind proposal go towards greater form independence also new vision agriculture puts innovation alongside tradition always find brothers italy group case favorable
#RufaGianfranco,"Mr President my fellow senators I renew my doubts and I urge questions worthy of interest such as those who want the nutri-score and those who are structuring the Farm to fork If there are politicians but above all our producers and producers who have many doubts I do not understand why there are associations acting as lobbyists who are in favour of this devious mechanism which is also easy to understand but very cowardly It is a method that compares coca cola to olive oil because they are two liquids as if I compared a shark to a red fish because they are two fish It is therefore a method against excellence on a request already well packaged and conditioned and it is annoying that among the associations that are part of Euroconsumers there is also Italian Other consumption in favor of the nutri-score with 377,000 members who I think do not know that this is part of an international network that the BEUC to which it is registered does not accept billing also 200 million per year and seems to be investigated also in Panama papers Besides them there are also online newspapers always linked to them therefore to think wrong is sin but often you guess as someone said And then there are wealthy wealthy people who push for artificial steaks and then produce them in bioreactors consuming not only energy but also water There is above all one fact if Italy does not accept the nutri-score it is also an objective reason because our diet UNESCO heritage allows a higher longevity in Europe a better life expectancy Germany for example is seventeenth and the lowest index of obesity than in France another country that wants the nutri-score has increased by 145 from the eighties to today There is to worry instead about infant obesity that is increasing precisely because it is watering down and polluting the Mediterranean diet That is precisely what we do in our Commission the defence of the Mediterranean diet and I thank all the members of the Agriculture Commission starting with our President Vallardi because we are defending the more than 1.5 million companies that allow us 15 of GDP in Italy with over 500 billion turnover We have also done enough with the Government we have achieved some results the defence of balsamic vinegar of the milk supply chain we have lowered excise duties on beer set up a fund for African swine fever obtained an increase from 105 to 160 for the fund for farms damaged by atmospheric adversity Still five million to save beekeeping 20 million plus 56 million for gastronomic excellence 500,000 euro for aromatic plants 25 million for the promotion of wine We defended Prosecco from Prošek and the Italian Chianti label we put two million for the distribution of food we wanted the register of agro-mechanicals and we also wanted a fund of five million for the purchase of machinery and software for agriculture 4.0 We do this because we put our face on and we do it with the undersecretary Gian Marco Centinario a prepared person therefore this is also our task to be in the government The food is narrator of Italy and if we do not defend it we will lose smells and flavors that have made us grow healthy The Farm to fork from the farm to the table is desirable if it is from Italian farms to tables all over the world and not the other way around It is like the history of energy we make it produce in France and we buy it at a higher cost There are doubts Some of the Farm to Fork methods are good reduction of pesticides and antimicrobials fertilizers loss of nutrients but as the Department of Agriculture of the United States of America says you even have to import fruits and vegetables practically the Mediterranean diet A greater demand would entail a higher cost a greater shortage of products and pollution of the Mediterranean diet and that is how much we risk being caused by the Farm to fork Then there is the other huge problem of Italian sounding which could be even more relevant We already lose 100 billion compared to 50 billion from Made in Italy We must therefore also pay attention to the contradiction that exists in Europe when trade agreements are signed with Mercosur where it is polluted and where imports are permitted Nutri-score and Farm to fork are therefore commendable projects but Italy can do without them if our Mediterranean diet is affected

#LaPietraPatrizioGiacomo,THE PIETRA FdI Mr President Mr Senator allow me first of all to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the work we have done and in particular Mr Vallardi for the sensitivity shown in wanting to involve the opposition in the drafting of a joint document to which we have joined firmly It could only be otherwise because when we talk about national interest and the defence of national interest we have never failed our support and our contribution The defence of our agri -food industry also corresponds to the defence of national interest not only from the economic point of view for the great value that the sector represents for national GDP but also because our agri-food is the result not only of the entrepreneurial capacity of many farmers farmers and processors but also of our culture and our traditions I would also like to thank the Undersecretary Centinario and Minister Patuanelli who is not present for the commitment they are showing and for the efforts they are making both at national and European level to defend our Made in Italy Allow me Mr Undersecretary also to stigmatize the fact that I do not remember and do not revisit the same commitment from the rest of the Government or from one part of it You see Mr. Undersecretary the defence of agro food also goes through economic policies of support and enhancement of the sector Unfortunately I say we cannot flag the fact that in the last budget law the resources for agriculture have doubled compared to the previous law when in absolute terms on a maneuver of more than 30 billion we can only reach a few hundred million as direct resources for the sector of course I am talking about direct resources It can not be said that it is believed in the sector if the PNRR invests in agriculture just over 6 7 billion on a Plan of about 300 billion Not only is there little economic attention but I am also thinking of the banking system where our farmers fishermen and farmers find enormous obstacles to access to credit In summary Undersecretary despite his commitment and despite the commitment of the Minister we do not think that the Government as a whole invests substantially in this sector which represents almost a quarter of national GDP So Mr Undersecretary I do not even see a foreign policy which is aimed at protecting national interests and protecting the sector I am thinking for example of fishing I would like to give an example to everyone where there is no strong policy to protect our fishermen and defend our seas I am thinking of relations with the countries of North Africa and with the countries of the Adriatic On the contrary we often represent in this sector the soft belly of a Europe that has left the fishing sector in the Mediterranean to its fate while defending ocean fishing by the sword And I could go further Instead we come to the subject of the motion I would like to stress how the way in which we have to deal with the Farm to Fork strategy that is pragmatically has been highlighted without letting ourselves go to often ideological environmentalist enthusiasms I say this in particular to those colleagues who are dealing with the environmental issue but do not have a practical view of the problem We have written this clearly reporting important studies such as that of the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the Joint Research Centre which warn of the danger that a farm to fork driven strategy can paradoxically create negative effects for our economy The figures are clear a substantial reduction in European agricultural production from 7 to 12 depending on the extent of the application of these strategies an increase in consumer prices by about 17 a substantial decrease in production and a large increase in costs which will put our farms in difficulty an increase in imports from non-EU countries where controls are very low as we know then creating those conditions in the rest of the world such as deforestation and an increase in mass production with even greater use of chemistry which we are trying to curb here in Europe Some taxes such as the 10 allocation of agricultural land to biodiversity must also be re-discussed and analysed on the basis of cost and benefit principles This provision in my view is even more damaging to our national agriculture which apart from specific geographical situations does not have a large amount of land available The morphology of most of the national territory already has green corridors and areas for biodiversity in itself and we cannot therefore apply this provision in a linear way I am thinking of the many hilly areas where there are numerous crops where the land is used up to the last meter and where moreover there are already uncultivated natural areas that can allow the passage or the protection of biodiversity I am thinking of the imposition of 25 increase in agricultural land for organic farming Great purpose but we have a duty to safeguard the quality of food as well as to guarantee everyone the possibility of feeding on healthy and guaranteed products We know that organic production substantially reduces the yield of the land consequently there will be an increase in costs I personally believe that we cannot create such an agriculture that we then have to divide between A series and B series consumers i.e. consumers who can afford expensive products compared to consumers forced to feed on poor quality food from other countries On this too we will have to reflect and not accept impositions that do not take into account the specific characteristics of Italy where organic or not there is a high quality of our agricultural products The desire to impose the nutrition labelling system Secretary of State aims at the type approval of products without taking into account their true contribution to an overall food system So much has already been said about this and many of my colleagues have well explained what it means which is why I will not repeat myself However I would like to point out that it is important for us to use the nutrinform battery system which in contrast to the nourishing score can actually give serious information to the consumer in order to evaluate the purchase of a particular product according to their food needs That is why we wanted to insist that the mechanism should include a commitment to pursue initiatives to promote this type of labelling and also to introduce new testing systems including through the creation of specific apps to have more data and to be more convincing towards the European community I also stress the importance of point 5 which few have highlighted where the Union is urged to adopt specific clauses to prevent imports of products that do not reflect the criteria of environmental economic and social sustainability an altar unfortunately on which we are paradoxically sacrificing so many of our companies We 've been talking about civilization duties for a long time but we 're not listening Much more could be said Mr Undersecretary but I would like to invite you if you give me a moment of attention to pay great attention to asking for the full support of the whole Government of the risk that we are running inherent in this system of the formal emergency that economic and commercial policies are applied in Europe as well as unfair even hostile and aggressive especially with regard to us that they are going to alter the competition of the market by favouring some economies and penalising others moreover in clear contradiction with the founding aims of the Union itself On this point in defence of national interests of our agriculture and of our agri-food you will always find us ready For these reasons I announce the vote in

#LaPietraPatrizioGiacomo,THE PIETRA FdI Mr President today finally ends the obstacle course of this measure which with the fourth reading in the Senate we can say that it will be finally adopted I say this because it is important and also to emphasize listening to the speeches of so many colleagues as is highlighted by the importance of agriculture but I am addressing the Government and my colleagues in the majority beyond the words and all the compliments we give to our farmers and our farmers it would be appropriate to be even more concrete because basically concreteness is also measured with how much resources the Government makes available to agriculture Unfortunately in the various measures that we have seen from the budget law to the PNRR these resources are not adequate neither at the level of this sector which is defined as primary but which is also fundamental for our economy The draft law that we are finally going to approve at the fourth reading in a definitive way is certainly an important step a framework law in fact that puts order to the organic production sector in our nation because as has already been pointed out and as we have said so many times in the various explanations of vote and in the various interventions that we have done also in the previous readings it is an important sector for Italian agriculture as it is for the whole of Europe There was therefore a need to put black on white and to codify a whole series of issues in order to allow our companies to work quietly There are important aspects that have been mentioned the organic brand the constitution of the districts the resources for promotion but I would like to invite my colleagues to give a little thought together with me Be careful not to pursue false myths as well By this I mean that we certainly cannot think of concentrating agriculture entirely on the organic sector because as we know organic farming has a much lower yield than the traditional one which should instead be encouraged through investment and research in order to enable it being in turn an important sector to produce enough food to feed our population The world population is approaching in the coming years the nine billion people who must be fed and I do not think it is fair to them nor to our fellow citizens because I have heard many of my colleagues say that this is an important niche that there are people who are willing to spend I believe that this is true but I think it is equally important to ensure that all citizens are able to feed properly because we cannot however think that we then have A and B series citizens who on the basis of their economic possibilities can feed better or worse than others This is a very important social reasoning which is particularly close to my heart It is therefore good that this bill has regularised the whole sector but let us be careful about these aspects Today unfortunately the situation that has erupted in Ukraine the war that some of you have already mentioned leads us to a reflection regarding the food supply of our country because there is not only an energy problem but we also have one that we will have to face and on which we will have to confront with regard to food self sufficiency Today about 25 of the durum wheat we import comes from Ukraine and Russia you understand that this together with the agricultural policies of Canada the United States and Australia also has a heavy impact on costs but basically it must lead us to reflect on what we are doing in our country to achieve self sufficiency in food at least in certain sectors Unfortunately we do not have it in any area but there is no national strategic plan for food security today On this we should confront each other and we must invest resources and certainly have a vision all united for the next few years Having said that I would also like to make clear some of the things that have happened in the course of this provision Moreover I am pleased that Senator Cattaneo has accepted the rewordings proposed by the Government because from here too a unanimous act and a commitment are born so that the nuances that still remain in the bill can be corrected As Brothers of Italy we have always supported its approval as I told you because the sector certainly needs it However we have always fought the equalization that exists within the law between biodynamic and biological so much so that at second reading we had proposed in the Committee on Agriculture amendments for the repeal of paragraph 3 of Article 1 which were rejected However we agreed with all the other group leaders that we would not have tabled amendments in this House to facilitate the process of the measure On that occasion Senator Cattaneo tabled amendments on which we in line with the line we had in the Commission voted in favour The measure went to the Chamber and an amendment was made to article 1 but unfortunately as has already been pointed out to article 5 which concerns the technical table of the Ministry for Organic and to article 8 which concerns the national plan has still remained the reference to biodynamics I want to hope that it is a forgetfulness of a non-political character but a drafting error the correction of which was prevented by the haste for the approval of the House and for the fourth reading in the Senate I do n't want to think that it 's a way to get the biodynamics out of the front door and then bring them back in the window by involving a representative of this category at the technical table and also recognize it within the national plan for the resources that need to be distributed As I said I am pleased that Senator Cattaneo presented this agenda and accepted the rewordings because it is clear that there is a clear commitment from the Government to ensure that we can vote on the timely amendments to Article 5 and Article 8 of the law which will be tabled in the next steps I will not repeat so many things that have been said partly because we have repeatedly spoken about this subject I therefore announce the vote in favour of the Brothers of Italy Group,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,32.251072,-19.212965,10,pietra fdi mr president today finally ends obstacle course measure fourth reading senate say finally adopted say important also emphasize

#LaPietraPatrizioGiacomo,Minister we have listened to your report so many numbers so many resources but the truth is that our agriculture is dry There is no water and we do not have the opportunity to distribute even the little water that exists in the most economical way possible to our farmers I say this to you Minister you have made a point which unfortunately as we may recall has been repeated many times now I remind you of the various water crises that there have been serious drought crises 1997 2002 2012 and 2017 which was the worst Some 5 billion damage has been estimated for these crises almost half due to the 2017 crisis and all the time politics questions has to intervene and the so called drought decrees come out The draft came out almost a month ago then there was some rain and it disappeared This is not the right attitude that politics must have There are plans and projects but we should try to apply them Let me give you some examples but not before a brief note In the draft decree that has circulated we do not know if it is the definitive one because we are now in such a chaos for which it is objectively difficult to make any kind of prediction there was also reference to a Commissioner whom you mentioned in your reasoning The Commissioner is a useful figure if he has the opportunity to operate but that is not enough A national plan is also needed to identify the water needs the structures necessary for the country system and within a national framework the specificities of each individual territory Indeed as you know almost 90 of national water consumption is absorbed by agriculture industry and electricity production Only 10 percent is about drinking water on which I will make a small note later In order to do this the Commissioner who must have the power to act and overcome all the various levels of governance which are so many at national level and which do not allow a precise framework to be found but there must also be this plan which we do not see today As I have already said the Commissioner must really have the powers to act I hope this is not a Commissioner like the one provided for in the decree on African swine fever since we have solved absolutely nothing What to do You Minister mentioned the consortia and you are right However I would remind you that more than a year ago the Agriculture and Food Production Commission of the Senate approved an assigned deal that made a very clear picture of the situation of reclamation and irrigation consortia You said in some cases that you did n't find the design ability but already in that assigned deal and in that resolution we had written that these problems were there Why not also look at the work being done This is the fundamental fact never look at it I would have liked to give some more thought but time is tyrant and it is ending The plans are there there are pond plans and there might be the possibility to stimulate the recovery of city waste water with purifiers Let 's think of some cities ruled by the center left for over seventy years I give you the punctual example of Pistoia where the center right came to power after seventy five years where there are still neighborhoods that are not connected to the sewers and do not have drinking water and where wells are used That is what we must do True 50 percent of the pipes lose but refer to 10 percent of the water used We must adopt a plan on which to act and ensure that at last there are not only speeches but also real and effective works,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,30.234934,-15.38896,10,minister listened report many numbers many resources truth agriculture dry water opportunity distribute even little water exists economical way

#LaPietraPatrizioGiacomo,THE PIETRA FdI Mr President Mr Senator ladies and gentlemen it is undeniable that we are experiencing a particularly complex moment which for many reasons has a negative impact on the agricultural system and beyond A conflict is taking place on the European territory between Ukraine and Russia an economic situation already dramatic in itself because of the pandemic has struck us dramatically in recent years in terms of health with negative consequences also on the productive sector climate change causes increasingly extreme events In this context rules laws and directives are inserted at different times at times when normality if we want to call it so could allow us to make choices that unfortunately today we must have the courage and I add the wisdom to change so as not to make the situation even worse The act under discussion goes in this direction Basically we ask the government to postpone the entry into force of the rules for the implementation of the ecological outflow of watercourses in place of the minimum vital outflow which I want to emphasize still remains in force I do not retrace the administrative history of the various provisions I merely point out that in this context this act is indispensable in order not to further preclude the withdrawal of water We must give priority and have responsibility Let it be clear that we care about the environment and the ecosystem of the waterways so much so that the rules of the vital minimum runoff are there and remain but today we have to deal with a changed situation We therefore need to understand the reasons for this request and this act We have said that the conjunction of certain situations is creating a perfect storm for the management of the national water system The pandemic has created many problems blocking for two years the majority of ordinary and extraordinary interventions Because of the health regulations many offices have been closed or with reduced staff design suspended everything slowed down to properly focus on the health emergency But now we have to make up for lost time The Russian aggression against Ukraine has led to an exponential increase in the costs of energy and raw materials The sanctions have also caused a negative impact on our companies to which we must try to give concrete answers Today Europe realises that there is no food sovereignty Italy is aware of how dependent it is on imports so it has rightly decided to increase the cultivated hectares and for this reason more water is needed Climate change is now characterized by extraordinary and sudden events sometimes with excessive rainfall sometimes with prolonged drought periods such as what we are currently experiencing with months of drought and a winter period that has seen little snowfall and that in view of the forecasts will continue with a summer with scarce rainfall making the situation even worse In all this the entry into force of the ecological outflow is involved a further regulatory criticality that must be postponed at the moment In the Commission we have understood the consequences of the entry into force of this principle and after having audited in just over two months many subjects we have drafted this document to be submitted to the Assembly 's opinion to engage the Government in some actions to be carried out to deepen the impact of the entry into force of the rules of ecological outflow but essentially to extend by two years from the entry into force of these rules and to make further investigation into this matter also with a view to the problems described above in order to make it all more sustainable Of course the management of water resources which invest different sectors from agricultural irrigation to civil use from artisan industrial use to the production of electricity I remember that in recent months the production of hydropower has dropped by 50 because of the drought in place and not least the protection of the environment cannot be based only on the problem of the subject matter of this document but should have a wider spectrum of action with a direction cabin that can better coordinate all the actors involved in the management of water resources from the regions to the authorities of the basin from the territorial areas to the municipalities from the societies owners of the networks to the consortia Mr President allow me to make a reflection which concerns in particular the parliamentary work and the management of the same by the Government which is not careful I use an understatement not only to the opposition 's proposals but to the work of the same Commissions In October 2020 in the Committee on Agriculture we unanimously approved if I am not mistaken the report on the deal allocated to problems relating to reclamation and irrigation consortia and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur at the time Senator Trentacoste for the work he has done In that report the Government committed itself to several points and I quote the most important ones the revival of the strategic role of the reclamation and irrigation consortia in the management and defence of the territory and its resources in the contrast to the hydrogeological risk and in the support to the national agriculture a revision and strengthening of the model of government of the consortia that consolidates the role of the farmer and the direct beneficiaries of the consort activities the adoption of measures aimed at the strengthening of the National Plan invaded in order to complete the work of execution of the already partially realized works to prepare the study of a plan of dredging of the invades and of care of the watercourses that allows to recover the volume of water collection All actions that if put on the field today would have allowed us to tackle the water problem certainly with greater tranquility All this could not be done that report did not come to this House and so we could not give these guidelines that would have been fundamental today to solve the problem of water Similarly to make a further point if the agricultural damage deal which was approved in the Commission had been brought to the Chamber perhaps the SAP emergency could have been dealt with differently President politics I say this to the representative of the government must also prevent and not only deal with emergencies when they can be foreseen I say this also in order to stigmatize how this heterogeneous majority renounces to discuss measures not only of common sense but also necessary in order to ensure the precarious balance between the various political forces that make up it As always we as Brothers of Italy make our contribution and guarantee our support for all those measures that we consider useful and necessary for the nation For all these reasons I announce as already expressed in the Commission the positive vote of the Brothers of Italy Group,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,28.861444,-16.031296,10,pietra fdi mr president mr senator ladies gentlemen undeniable experiencing particularly complex

#LaPietraPatrizioGiacomo,THE PIETRA FdI Mr President I will be very brief but I would at least like to have time to explain the reasons why the Brothers of Italy abstained on certain articles I immediately declare that we will vote in favour of this measure and give it our responsibility because it is a text that can certainly make a positive contribution to our farmers and because small local produce can represent an increase in income that can certainly help those farmers farmers and fishermen in disadvantaged areas However I must also say that a common sense provision had come out of the Senate while the changes that have been made to the House have in fact distorted the provision in its essential foundations I am thinking of the amendment of point a of paragraph 1 of Article 1 which strictly binds to compliance with the sanitary regulations and controls I am thinking of the deletion of point b of the same paragraph in which the principle of marginality is deleted That is why we voted in favour of abstaining Another key element is the deletion of paragraphs 3 4 and 5 of Article 4 on the PPL mark It was a way of helping farmers to characterize their product both direct and processing and also of adding value to consumers Finally I would like to stress the further concern raised by the amendment to Article 7 where many paragraphs have been abolished which actually represented the way to lower this law within the local productive realities which for centuries have been the place of the production of many of our articles In conclusion I repeat the positive vote of the Group of Brothers of Italy assuming that it is still preferable to have an instrument albeit imperfect as this bill comes out to make available to the territories rather than to delay the entry into force of this measure,#group.FdI,Fratelli d'Italia,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,31.62206,-19.213953,10,pietra fdi mr president brief would least like time explain reasons brothers italy abstained certain articles immediately declare vote favour measure give responsibility text certainly make positive contribution farmers small local produce represent increase income certainly help farmers farmers fishermen disadvantaged areas however must also say common sense provision come senate changes made house fact distorted provision essential foundations thinking amendment point paragraph 1 article 1 strictly binds compliance sanitary regulations controls thinking deletion point b paragraph principle marginality deleted voted favour abstaining another key element deletion paragraphs 3 4 5 article 4 ppl mark way helping farmers characterize product direct processing also adding value consumers finally would like stress concern raised amendment article 7 many paragraphs abolished actually represented way lower law within local productive realities centuries place production many articles conclusion repeat positive vote group brothers italy assuming still preferable instrument albeit imperfect bill comes make available territories rather delay entry force measure
#BergesioGiorgioMaria,Bergesio L SP PSd Az Mr President Mr Undersecretary Italian agri-food is synonymous with excellence In 2020 Italy confirmed itself in the first place of the European Union to 27 for added value of agriculture with over 31.4 billion euros ahead of France 30.2 billion and Spain 29 billion Also in 2020 there was an average increase of 9.7 in the consumption of the product symbol of the Mediterranean diet such as extra virgin olive oil fruit vegetables up to pasta Fruit with an increase in purchases of 11 percent is the leader of the expenditure classification in the second place extra virgin olive oil where consumption increases by 9.7 following the high profits recorded by the pasta made with wheat 100 percent made in Italy Remember that the Mediterranean diet has been recognized as an intangible heritage of UNESCO because of its peculiarities based on the balanced consumption of food that belongs to the culture and the millennial tradition of our country which is characterized by its varied heritage of biodiversity It is therefore unjustified to work to put in place systems that should be characterized by the right information to consumers for proper nutrition but that are actually more conditioned by ruthless market logics that are based solely on economic interests I refer explicitly to all these additional labelling systems designed and patented by private agencies and which union bureaucrats would like to impose on all countries regardless of the respect for the traditions and food cultures that have always characterized and made unique the more than 100 European peoples As far as the food regime is concerned this Europe also thinks in a sterile and aseptic way based solely on quotas and measures For example the nourishing score system even if it reaches the consumer in an immediate way providing in a simple way the information required with the use of colors and letters actually bases its judgment on the elaboration of complicated systems based on algorithms that condition the judgment of the consumer relying only on some nutrients such as salt and fats without making a more articulated reasoning based on the right portions and doses to be taken during a food day Hence the paradox of seeing rejected products such as our Parmigiano Reggiano and extra virgin olive oil while at the same time they are promoted carbonated and sweetened drinks this is a real shame This system does n't seem to get stuck in front of anything After meat and cheese now wine is also under attack a drink that has belonged for millennia to the history not only of Italy but of the whole of Europe In fact the ultra processed products and those that can be reworded and built in the laboratory to ensure that the components are all within the palettes established by the algorithm In this way it will be easy for example to get a seasoning with a green nourishing score putting that amount of fat maybe vegetable to give flavor without raising the score too much as well as that little salt that is enough to be within the limit that would trigger the next point a little protein that compensate for that pinch of extra fat and voila the dressing is served This is not the Mediterranean diet With a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil which will have a yellow label an alert signal of the nourishes score instead a salad is seasoned in a healthier and more pleasant way The large organized distribution can amplify the phenomenon and influence the choices The risk is that greener products are promoted as safe to fill the trolleys with food that could not always have optimal quality Ultimately if the nourishing score has been conceived as a tool to combat overweight it is believed that on the contrary it favours an increase in the consumption of ultra- processed foods which will appear green and healthy but are not Moreover it does not focus the attention of the consumer on the necessary portion of food and does not contribute to proper food education since it penalizes better food It is news of these days that France proposes to add a sixth letter the F associated with the black colour to classify the drinks containing alcohol even in small quantities it is very serious if we think that this is due to the fact that in the wine there is a very small amount of alcohol among other things very reduced from 5 to 15 percent maximum which would give it a danger connotation so as to denounce its carcinogenic effects This is a real strategy of terror that is based on increasing the right fears of consumers without entering into the merit of the due differentiations that must be made between the use and the abuse of a food In the light of this set of evidence we consider it of great importance that the national scientific community in particular nutrition experts and those who deal primarily with the issue of obesity intervene in the debate taking place at Community level stressing that on the basis of the evidence available the package front labelling system proposed by the Italian Government called nutinform battery should be considered the most appropriate to increase the nutritional knowledge of the public and consumers and to provide consumers themselves with the information necessary to deal with it with more preparation and therefore probably with a better result the theme of the prevention of

#BergesioGiorgioMaria,"Mr President Minister drought damage is extraordinarily important We know that drought is not just a matter of this year for our country We started from afar at the beginning of the 2000s in 2003 the first very serious year of drought then 2017 and in part 2021 and now 2022 a very dramatic year In the last ten years the estimates were about 10 billion euros of damage due to drought in our country Only this year we are already talking about over 3 billion according to Coldiretti's estimates This means starting immediately with an important mechanism that of refunds to farmers which must be compensated for these damages But let us start with the measures that we are able to implement We have asked as the Lega Group already in the last decree the one on which we will have the confidence tomorrow to include the extension for 20 of fuel costs as a tax credit a measure which is included only for fishing but which must also be provided for agriculture and for the whole year Let 's make things easy and that can be accomplished Indemnization however also means adding important measures for credit implementing Ismea 's guarantees giving the opportunity to make liquidity more large for companies for our 740,000 farms Minister we do not want to contradict you but you made an important step in your speech and we have followed very carefully with reference to this notorious decree Well we 're not on any side jokes This decree should have been issued by the government for twenty days and so it was not But above all you tell us that we will see whether this decree will cover as I believe we have all read in this House the commissioners and submissaries for the management of the water emergency It now says that reference could be made to the structure of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers I do n't know if you 're referring to Casa Italia or some similar structure but I think if we activate these structures we 're not going anywhere We need to give clear responsibilities to well identified figures very carefully and to take the situation into their own hands and solve the problems Otherwise drought in our country will not be just a question of 2022 There are the great theme of the cleanliness of the riverbeds that of the recovery of the spaces of the invaders the theme of the detachment of the basins of the existing dams to be cleaned and of the increase of capacity In our territory there are structural problems and you know it well because the 1980 studies said that in our country the need for invading had to be 17 billion cubic meters to date we are at 11 billion cubic meters but potentially the need for hydro has increased and we would need 20 billion for agriculture So we 're traditionally behind In the Committee on Agriculture as President Vallardi who is sitting next to me and the rapporteur Senator Taricco know we have started a path to discuss and analyse a national irrigation plan But it is essential that the Ministry of Agriculture together with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and the Ministry of Sustainable Infrastructure and Mobility take the situation into account It takes a clear and orderly plan to draw up but let 's start with simple things things that exist We have seen that in these days the National Association of Bonifices and Irrigations ANBI has presented a plan to realize 223 small invaded 655 million cubic meters of capacity that could irrigate 430,000 hectares for a value of 3,25 billion Let 's start with this Let 's start doing these things because they become fundamental The ANBI has made this proposal which may or may not be pleasing because it is an expression of the reclamation and irrigation consortia but it has an important value because it is working very hard on it In addition to this there is also the National Union of Municipalities Communities and Mountain Authorities UNCEM which has made five important proposals efficiency planning encouragement concert the realization of these themes that come to the other side In my opinion there is a stimulus It is true that there are problems Just think of the mutual fund for catastrophal emergencies Minister this year in our country if only one farmer wanted to make sure for the drought he could not do it because no insurance company assured him the farmers wanted to do it but they could not Multi-risk insurance which is very important does not cover drought unfortunately it covers floods and other disasters such as storm and wind damage which is fine but not drought We know that on 21 July the company will be set up by Ismea who will manage the famous appropriation of 700 million euros per year and then through the SIN will also partially enter the Ministry of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policies What we are asking you from now to the end of the year is to activate this procedure the Agriculture Commission and the House will agree with you because we need clear answers on compensation to farmers We cannot think that even in 2023 no one will be sure about the drought because it means making a huge affront I conclude Minister by quoting one of your words on The Messenger today On the theme of water and drought I 'm a little tired of a country that talks talks and does n't You are right but think if the Minister is fed up what do our voters everyone think and what do farmers think I therefore ask you for an enormous effort to tackle the problem with President Draghi and with the Government because otherwise the drought emergency will become a disaster for all Italian agriculture",#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,27.673557,-16.382053,10,"mr president minister drought damage extraordinarily important know

#BergesioGiorgioMaria,Mr President some of the data I am going to list are important in order to frame the issue that we are dealing with here today in this House Only 3 percent of the planet 's water is sweet and only 0.9 percent of it is represented by liquid surface water lakes streams rivers ponds readily usable by vegetation and life forms Although it covers 70 of our planet water is a finite and irreplaceable resource Water uses in Italy are as follows 54 per cent for agricultural and irrigation purposes 28 per cent for civil and drinking 20 per cent for industrial and 5 per cent for energy purposes Italy is in second place in the European Union for water withdrawals for drinking use with about 152 cubic meters per capita per year that is twice as much as the European average and is in the first place in the world and in Europe for consumption of bottled mineral water with a per capita consumption of 200 litres per year despite a quality of Italian water supplied by the very high network and recognized in most of the world Without water there can be no life and there can be no agriculture In Italy 85 of agri -food crops are irrigation the availability of the water resource is therefore essential to keep the quality agricultural system alive without which the competitiveness of Made in Italy agri-food and the vitality of most of our territories are at risk Water generates one fifth of the national gross domestic product but Italy is at the last places in the European Union for investments in the water sector investments on the water network are an average of 40 euros per inhabitant per year compared with over 100 euros per inhabitant of the European average The estimated increase in the invading capacity needed by the country to meet water needs during the period of scarcity is 5 billion cubic metres With a view to sustainable management of the water resource as the European Union also calls for projects and actions must be promoted that take into account the specific characteristics of the most fragile territories of our regions and encourage flexible management of ecological defluxes and encourage the evolution of the agricultural sector towards a model that involves the use of more efficient irrigation techniques Above all it is of fundamental importance the realization of invasions that allow on the one hand to face the lack of availability of water resources and on the other to protect the territory in case of extreme events such as floods that now more and more frequently devastate our peninsula The ecological transition in the use of water resources a path dictated by Community strategies and which we have very clear requires a great commitment and a great investment effort on the part of the water supply chain For the next five years the estimated requirement is about EUR 10 billion In this context as a Parliament we must support the increase in storage capacity In our country 89 percent of rainwater flows directly into the sea without being reused We must realize these small and medium invaded in order to give strength and energy to the destination of water to a plurimo use to what is civil human use to irrigation to industrial to the production of energy to the rolling of the floods In short there are a number of aspects that are absolutely binding and necessary to achieve a better usability of the water With this resolution the need to prevent national agricultural production for which measures have already been envisaged for the increase in production from being penalized by a combination of problems arising from the dramatic drought situation which since last autumn has hit the most important hydrological basins of the country to which are added the possible deleterious effects of the transition towards the new methodology of calculation of the minimum flow out vital to ensure the maintenance in the watercourses of the ecological outflow in support of the achievement of the objectives of environmental quality of water bodies under the framework directive on water This framework directive on water has been transposed in Italy by legislative decree of 3 April 2006 n. 152 the so called TUA single environmental text and provides for the definition with a special decree of the Minister of the Environment and the protection of the territory and the sea of the criteria aimed at guaranteeing the minimum life flow into the bodies of water providing that all the derivations of water still in place are regulated by the granting authority through the provision of releases aimed at guaranteeing the minimum life flow of water bodies With the decree of the Director General for the protection of the territory and waters of the Ministry of the Environment of February 2017 the guidelines for the updating of the methods of determination of the minimum vital outflow in order to ensure the maintenance in the watercourses of the ecological outflow have been approved The application of calculation methodologies unfortunately involves in the light of the studies carried out so far a significant impact on the derivations that beyond the climatic trend will be subject to serious restrictions such as to lead to a possible failure to meet the irrigation needs of the entire territory with inevitable repercussions on agriculture the environment and also on tourism the industrial sector and the craft sector We therefore propose the achievement of the experiments delaying for this purpose the time limits for adapting the water releases of the existing derivations for a period of at least two years allowing within the same period the realization of activities of analysis of hydraulic and climatic data as well as socio- economic studies for the identification of interventions also structural aimed at preserving the food safety of the population and the maintenance of the economic system of the Country without prejudice to the respect of the previous discipline on the vital minimum outflow in force until 31 December 2021 We also call for an immediate commitment to the Government and Parliament to find the appropriate financial resources to support the study and analysis activities needed to complete the transition from the minimum vital outflow to the ecological outflow We also call for the adoption of a strategy for regulating water consumption that aims immediately at the realization of collection works for the reduction of water collections and the increase of the water release of the invaders of the water basins considering also to intervene on domestic uses through interventions aimed at water saving and consequently also energy saving Subsequently in the medium to long period we also call for the adoption of compensatory systems for the implementation of consumption so as to allow the allocation of suitable financial resources for the realization of new and more efficient aqueducts with automatic reading and innovative systems the implementation of the capacity to invade the water basins and finally the realization of new invades I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Food Production of the Senate President Vallardi and all my colleagues for their efforts We have been working on this since October 2021 I also thank the National Association of Consortiums for the management and protection of the territory and irrigation waters Anbi its president and director the authorities of the basin the environmental organizations the Regions the Ministries and all those who have carried

#BergesioGiorgioMaria,"Mr President European policies aimed at improving the sustainability of the agricultural and agri -food system cannot fail to take account of the peculiarities of our production system The most dramatic effects of current climate change are being measured on agriculture This summer 's severe drought is bringing companies to their knees which are facing an unprecedented water crisis We are talking about a historical drought harder much harder than that of 2003 and 2017 The estimates speak of 3 billion damage already caused by this drought The wheat being harvested is among the least at risk crops with an expected drop of no less than 30 percent Added to the loss is the 170 increase in the cost of fertilizers and the price of agricultural gas oil almost tripled in one year Fruit and vegetables soy and corn are the most endangered crops Rice deserves to speak to itself Without rain the administrations of Pavia Novara and Vercelli will have to choose between the preservation of the harvest and the rationing of water for civil use The consequences are serious and dramatic also for energy production already in distress due to the gas crisis Over 175 municipalities in Piedmont 36 in Lombardy and 14 Emilia Romagna are served by Civil Protection As far as the hydropotable service is concerned the situation is now a real emergency For agriculture and farms especially the North and the Centre they are suffering this dramatic climate change Italy however let us be clear is in the European context the country with more water with 302 billion cubic meters of rain per year of which 53 billion cubic meters usable of these however we manage to store only 11 percent that is 5.3 billion cubic meters We have a great wealth of watercourses 7,594 lakes 324 and over a thousand large groundwaters but at the same time we have a lack of infrastructure never renewed since the war 600,000 kilometers of water supply which on average lose 42 percent of water Irrigation then in Italy is a fundamental condition for having a competitive agriculture on the global markets and consequently an agri-food system of excellence In fact to be threatened is also the competitiveness of the agri -food made in Italy already hit by the increases in energy costs resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and those of raw materials these events that combined with the climate emergency in place risk creating irreversible damage to the Italian agri -food system The Italian model is at the heart of the debate on green policies developed within Europe The sector is one of the most competitive at European level yet the project seems to be to bring about a dismantling in the name of a universal diet based on the consumption of synthetic and ultra- processed foods from vegetable meat to milk made with fermented proteins Italian meat is born from the systems of breeding that for safety sustainability and quality are among the best in the world making it a food of absolute excellence whose consumption is indicated in a healthy and balanced daily diet As for synthetic milk we are talking about putting into crisis over 25,000 stables a sector that in our country is worth 16 billion between harvesting production and processing We therefore call on this House today through this intervention to act in a structural way primarily by investing in the modernisation and security of European water networks with a view to stimulating actions in the implementation of small invaders Today the catch capacity is 11 percent that is we have 11 billion cubic meters of water invaded in our country think that according to the 1980 studies the need was to be 18 billion More than 45 of the resources are missing from the appeal On the other hand the particularly important National Recovery and Resilience Plan offers € 1.320 billion to the irrigation system The problem is that this amount must only be used for efficiency and extraordinary maintenance no new plants can be built From this point of view too we call on the Government to have this funding changed in Europe especially in the light of the future CAP because there is also an important link on these issues We are on the side of our farmers producers consumers for food and above all the quality of our products and production and if we have water we must contain it to use

#BossiSimone,Minister I would not like to be repetitive because on this subject which is dear to me I made a speech at the end of the sitting a few days ago and something has moved at least in part of our country from the mountain to the plain However the communities affected are still many and there is still a great need for water Today the agricultural world is aware of what is happening and perhaps farmers are the only ones who are really aware of it Unfortunately politics is not unfortunately politics is still coming late If it does n't rain it 's no one 's fault for Christ 's sake and I emphasize it and repeat it But if rainwater as much or as little as it is is always wasted and it has been for decades not since yesterday it is certainly the responsibility of all those who have not wanted to see a bit more of their noses If we turn on the TV and radio every day we hear the usual things the climate is changing the glaciers are melting there is global warming In the midst of all these phrases the only really important thing we do is pretend not to hear them fresh water is a precious asset it is the only good that can give us life today and we are wasting it every day What do we do to safeguard water We have 20 in the North and 40 to 60 in the South Central waste of drinking water due to deterioration of the water supply and nobody does or says anything We only notice the problem when the water is n't there Is it possible that none of the thousands of experts we have in Italy and we really have many experts in everything have ever thought of making a water collection system in the invaders at the lowest point that is the Po Valley They make them in the mountains and we do n't do them downstream And then we complain that the water does n't come from the mountains This is insane Minister I will tell you more at a particular moment like this those few far sighted projects that exist of collection invades realized in the plain that we have done in the fifties and sixties we do not even use them I quote an example that I have before my eyes near my house that I know very well in my territory there is the famous or infamous navigable canal a work never finished started and remained there in the middle of the countryside We 're talking about 13 kilometers of water on concrete shores a 40 metre wide and 4 metre high canal In this phase of severe water crisis in my territory has not been used Do you know why Minister The bureaucracy did not allow use in emergency What was the use of spending thousands of public money on works that are not used in the moment of need You see Minister I am addressing you because you are here although we understand that we are talking about a problem that we have been carrying for years and that persists I do not think we can tell farmers today we did not have any water we do not give you any money and if we give it to you you have to be content with what we are giving you It 's not just uncomfortable it 's also annoying We urgently need a refreshment of all I repeat all the losses of the agricultural world and not as we did with the Covid giving money a lot to everyone throwing billions We need a serious compensation fund I hope it will come as soon as possible because it must be agreed with the trade associations and based on three basic criteria product estimates damage quantification short term and long term repercussions On these three fundamental pillars then we go to compensate for all those activities that have the right to do so not one more and not one less This makes a serious country this makes a serious political class Today 's damage in Italy is estimated at 4.5 billion of these alone in Lombardy we speak of 2.2 billion loss We are talking about 20 percent of companies that have harvested zero The estimate is almost over 20 percent of the total loss and 40 percent of the other farms which is between 35 and 45 percent of the first sowing crop loss If we are aware of the damage that farmers and agriculture are experiencing we may be able to understand what will happen to us shortly And today it is absolutely necessary to help that agriculture and that agricultural world to get out of this drought related crisis If you will allow me Minister with the PNRR we cannot miss the great opportunity to renew our country to the challenges in step with the times not throwing away money in useless projects but investing them in projects that really serve our country,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,32.0989,-13.1339655,10,minister would like

#BossiSimone,BOSSI Simone L SP PSd Az Mr President unfortunately today after just one month of irrigation the situation in Lower Lombardy is before everyone 's eyes It is a situation that I call not serious but dramatic The agricultural world is aware of what is happening and perhaps the only one who realizes it Of course if it does n't rain it 's no one 's fault for God 's sake but it 's not to blame or to find a culprit that I decided to do this surgery I have decided to take the floor today because I am making myself and the House the fear of a whole supply chain the agricultural one that if it does not produce today tomorrow will have nothing to put on our tables Faced with images of dry fields and bare production I wonder why if the agricultural world does not want to give up and is not giving up politics has already given up It is not enough to take refuge behind the compensation measures contained in the decrees that will be issued Northern farmers are still calling loudly speaking for mountain basins to let go of water to save at least that part of production and cultivation that can still be saved today Let 's not talk about 20 years of irrigation and water We 're talking about a few weeks We 're talking about about 20 days of water The day before yesterday I met the farmers from Coldiretti who took me to those camps I saw their frantic eyes in front of the dried crops I have seen in their eyes resignation for the abandonment by the institutions Speaking to them I have decided to speak and to speak in this House Mine is an appeal to the Ministry the Minister and the Presidents of the Region because still a part of the harvest could be saved intervening not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow but today and immediately Eighty percent of the crops of mulched corn and hay fodder are missing at the appeal Stable meadows are permanently compromised and in addition to economic loss we also lose an important biodiversity heritage There will also be serious repercussions for the feeding of herds of cattle and some farms will be forced to reduce the number of animals unable to guarantee their food It is therefore necessary to immediately release all the water invaded in the alpine basins which on June 26 amounts to 182 million cubic metres I say this because there are rules that establish the priority agricultural use of water compared to other uses agricultural drinking domestic and energy use Without food the energy will be of little use We absolutely cannot afford to delay the release of the alpine basins is the largest voice of national GDP,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,30.82088,-15.523028,10,bossi simone l sp psd az mr president unfortunately today one month irrigation situation lower lombardy everyone 's eyes situation call serious dramatic agricultural world aware happening perhaps one realizes course n't rain 's one 's fault god 's sake 's blame find culprit decided surgery decided take floor today making house fear whole supply chain agricultural one produce today tomorrow nothing put tables faced images dry fields bare production wonder agricultural world want give giving politics already given enough take refuge behind compensation measures contained decrees issued northern farmers still calling loudly speaking mountain basins let go water save least part production cultivation still saved today let 's talk 20 years irrigation water 're talking weeks 're talking 20 days water day yesterday met farmers coldiretti took camps saw frantic eyes front dried crops seen eyes resignation abandonment institutions speaking decided speak speak house mine appeal ministry minister presidents region still part harvest could saved intervening tomorrow day tomorrow today immediately eighty percent crops mulched corn hay fodder missing appeal stable meadows permanently compromised addition economic loss also lose important biodiversity heritage also serious repercussions feeding herds cattle farms forced reduce number animals unable guarantee food therefore necessary immediately release water invaded alpine basins june 26 amounts 182 million cubic metres say rules establish priority agricultural use water compared uses agricultural drinking domestic energy use without food energy little use absolutely cannot afford delay release alpine basins largest voice national gdp
