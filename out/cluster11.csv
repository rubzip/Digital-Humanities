#CalderoliRoberto,Mr Calderoli rapporteur Mr President first of all as we approach the conclusion of our work I note and I thank you for that that in an hour and three quarters this Senate has revolutionized a regulation for the second time in my opinion not only with numerical adjustments but also improving the functioning of the Senate Then we stop at what are proposed almost as religious battles Personally I am completely alien to the battles of religion because I do n't believe it but I think there is a principle of common sense that must be used whenever something is done I have made an assessment of a first version of Mr Maiorino 's amendment which directly introduced important amendments into our Rules of Procedure which I do not think can be dealt with in a forum like this because they should be contained in a Rules of Procedure something As rapporteurs and as a Junta we have expressed a favourable opinion on a reformulated text which I want to clarify why the speeches both in support and against do not correspond to the content of the amendment The amendment aims to include an additional article whereby the Presidency Council then the next one sets out the general criteria it does not just say how to amend the Rules of Procedure so that in the institutional communication and in the activity of the administration it is ensured that the gender distinction is respected in language i.e. by avoiding the use of a single gender in the identification of functions and roles while respecting the principle of equality between men and women I heard his friend and colleague Schifani say that it is right to leave the freedom of choice I am voting for this amendment precisely in order to leave the freedom of choice because today if I use a single genre I have already established that the other genre cannot be used So I want the President to call himself the President if he likes him whether he is a man or a woman and the President woman calls herself the President I would not be the President in my case because I will never be the President Everything is then entrusted to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure which will make proposals which will return to the House for possible transposition into the text of the Rules of Procedure of what we have stated in general terms So we do n't do religious battles and move on,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-8.95048,-13.735401,11,mr calderoli rapporteur mr president first approach conclusion work note thank hour three quarters senate revolutionized regulation second time opinion numerical adjustments also improving functioning senate stop proposed almost religious battles personally completely alien battles religion n't believe think principle common sense must used whenever something done made assessment first version mr maiorino 's amendment directly introduced important amendments rules procedure think dealt forum like contained rules procedure something rapporteurs junta expressed favourable opinion reformulated text want clarify speeches support correspond content amendment amendment aims include additional article whereby presidency council next one sets general criteria say amend rules procedure institutional communication activity administration ensured gender distinction respected language i.e. avoiding use single gender identification functions roles respecting principle equality men women heard friend colleague schifani say right leave freedom choice voting amendment precisely order leave freedom choice today use single genre already established genre cannot used want president call president likes whether man woman president woman calls president would president case never president everything entrusted committee rules procedure make proposals return house possible transposition text rules procedure stated general terms n't religious battles move

#AugussoriLuigi,Please Senator Augussori Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Thank you Mr President I would say that there will be two obvious advantages greater clarity of the text and more streamlined work in this House as a result of the fewer votes needed Secondly it is envisaged that the filter committees Constitutional Affairs and Budget Committees should express their opinion only on the amendments adopted and therefore downstream of the Commission 's work on the substance and no longer upstream of all the amendments which have sometimes been tabled in an instrumental and massive manner and with subsequent texts 2 3 4 etc This will enable the work of the Budget Commission to be considerably lightened with the important possibility of applying greater discernment on the truly significant amendments and will bring greater fluidity to the Commission 's work on the substance which today is too often subject to continuous stops and go and to the results of what is a genuine roulette The third amendment which is probably the most important political amendment provides that the Budget Commission should no longer be required to give an opinion against the amendments to which the technical report does not come From the next legislature in fact the Government will be required to transmit the technical report within five days of the request If this is not transmitted there is no more automatism which involves the presumption of honesty or lack of coverage but it will be the Commission that evaluates it in full autonomy as it is right that it is in a sovereign Parliament It comes to fall therefore the alibi behind which the Ministries were used to hide so as not to allow the discussion of unpleasing themes Let us therefore return to reaffirming the supremacy of the elected of the people over the bureaucrats of state A final chapter of the reform is aimed at countering the misconception of those who once elected relocate from one group to another as shipwrecked in continuous search of the landing place on a happy island A number of disincentives including economic ones are put in place to counter this practice As an example of what is happening in the European Parliament the figure of the non-attached to any group is also expected for the elected senators who are now only in use for those under the rule of law This means that those who by abandoning their Group cannot join another Group let alone the Mixed Group are classified as such Those who are expelled from their Group will be granted three days to join an existing Group Non-members will be guaranteed areas of intervention and participation in the Commissions but not the economic prerogatives provided for the Groups It is also expected to be more rigid for the formation of new groups and components of the Mixed with clear and non-negotiable criteria with the typical alchemies of the First Republic The new wording provides that new groups may be formed only if they are composed of 9 senators instead of 6 as we have seen will be the new ordinary minimum number representative of a party or political movement of which they take the mark which in the legislature has submitted its own candidates to the parliamentary elections or to the European Parliament resulting in the election of its own representatives Therefore the new groups can only be set up at real parties Other changes always aimed at discouraging transformation provide that the decline from office is extended to the Quaestors and to all members of the Councils With regard to the Assembly of Elections and Immunities the allocation of the Presidency to a representative of the opposition is strengthened stating that this condition must continue throughout the term of office under penalty of forfeiture and not only occur at the time of election Finally Article 5 presents a final provision always aimed at discouraging transfers to another parliamentary group in which it is envisaged to amend the discipline of contributions to the Groups both to curb the phenomenon of mobility concerned and to achieve savings in expenditure for the Senate I 'm gonna do a little writing ma'am I sincerely regret what happened just now to the amendment tabled by Mr Maiorino the reformulated text was genuinely balanced our Group supported it and on the request for a secret vote as we have seen it did not give support We voted in favour of the amendment but I regret to see what has happened in this House namely that the necessary quorum has not been reached Too bad years and years of struggles were thrown into the basket I would point out however that in the field of the enlarged centre left alone wide field wide field as you wish I have found the absence of 18 senators I wo n't name them Anyone who wants can look for them Well I have to say that battles right or wrong and this is a fair battle are fought and won on the ground Otherwise it 's mere demagogy Obviously those 18 senators do n't have to account to me we would miss but they will have to make it to their electricians if anything In conclusion Mr President we believe that this report as dismissed by the Junta

#AugussoriLuigi,Mr Agussori L SP PSd Az Mr President as I was anticipating earlier there are problems in Article 5 In other words there are amendments which have been transformed into agendas which are missing in the file I am referring to Senator Parente 's amendment 5.3 the amendment to be voted on remains in the file but in fact it has been withdrawn turned into an agenda and approved The same is true of Senator Vitali 's amendment 5.5 with the famous table which at the request of the Government has been transformed into an agenda and then accepted It 's not in the text Then there are the amendments 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 and 5.10 of which the text 1 has remained in the dossier which has actually been exceeded by a text 2 which has been transformed into five agendas all of which have been adopted Therefore for Article 5 the file is completely wrong,#group.L-SP,Lega-Salvini Premier,IT,#orientation.RRF,M,-19.67981,-12.311166,11,mr agussori l sp psd az mr president anticipating earlier problems article 5 words amendments transformed agendas missing file referring senator parente 's amendment 5.3 amendment voted remains file fact withdrawn turned agenda approved true senator vitali 's amendment 5.5 famous table request government transformed agenda accepted 's text amendments 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 5.10 text 1 remained dossier actually exceeded text 2 transformed five agendas adopted therefore article 5 file completely wrong
