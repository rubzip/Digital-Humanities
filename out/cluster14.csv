#JoséMaríaFigaredoÁlvarezSala,"Thank you very much Madam President We are debating the section of the General Budgets of the State referring to the Ministry of Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge and the previous speaker Mr. de Podemos comes and talks to us about the virtues of communism and I am impacted impacted not only because he defends communist ideology itself but because he speaks about communist ideology in a forum that includes ecological transition climate etc Communist ideology is a murderous criminal ideology Throughout history and we go back and forth Pol Pot murdered 1.7 million people in cold blood in Cambodia all the men who had glasses killed them for the mere fact of being able to read Yesterday 's Communist Mr. Podemos laughs but you would have been killed in Pol Pot Cambodia Stalin killed at least 23 million people directly and immediately Mao killed 78 million people It is the communist ideology criminal and murderous ideology that moreover has most attacked the climate of human history They were able to dry a sea the Aral Sea for their madness to cultivate cotton in the area they reduced a sea and turned it into a pool of hypersalinity Are those the communists who come here to talk about the weather Those The communists responsible for the greatest nuclear accident in man 's history the Chernobyl accident for operating a nuclear power plant in terrible conditions where in addition to making energy they used to generate atomic fuel for their nuclear weapons A warlike murderous criminal and frontal enemy ideology of the climate And they come here to teach us lessons Do you really have so little shame to talk about here You are the hypocrisy and the personified lie It is important for the Spaniards to understand that if this item of the General Budgets of the State referred to the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge is approved as it is Spain loses Spain sinks and the future of Spain will paint increasingly darker Why Because in the end this Ministry of Ecological Transition does all it does with this budget item is impose and place its agenda on us I 'll explain myself They come here and they tell us no we have to stop polluting we have to stop emitting CO2 because there is climate change in the world and our farmers are suffering But still understanding the argument Spain emits 0.7 of the world 's CO2 Does it make sense that our farmers cannot use their diesel tractors Does that make sense Does it make sense that our farmers cannot grow barley or wheat in Spain and instead we have to import it Do you really believe that what is cultivated in other parts of the world does not emit the same CO2 that is emitted here Does it make sense for Catalonian pig farms to close down to directly import pig production from China Do you think that pig production does n't pollute What happens is that you Mrs Ribera are exporting Spanish production you are moving it to other countries of the world which are the ones that get rich Meanwhile our workers for example those in the Upper Horns of Asturias which are now going to close will go to the street those in our car factories which produce around 12 of Spain 's GDP will go to the street And in return Mrs Ribera those jobs will be located in Morocco Algeria or any other country in the world Our workers will have gone to the street and at best we will reduce global CO2 emissions by a regrettable 0.7 In addition it is important for all Spaniards to know and understand that Spain is one of the least CO2 emitting countries in the world Spain is below the EU average per capita emissions where the average emissions are 5.7 tonnes of CO2 per capita while Spain is around 4 In turn Europe is the region of the world that emits less CO2 per capita and per euro of gross value added in its GDP In conclusion despite being one of the most efficient countries you force our industry to close force the countryside to stop cultivating and in return do n't bring us anything because when you come and tell us about the drought again buying the argument Spain has pulled on average almost 30,000 cubic hectometres of water Those 30,000 cubic hectometres of water on the one hand for the higher quantities of the Albufeira Convention that we passed to Portugal and on the other for the quantities that are poured from the Ebro to the sea will allow us to triple the surface of irrigation that we have in Spain And that Minister could you promote it but no it does not promote it what you promote is to distribute money to your friends through IDAE with grants of 13 million euros while spending on salaries and salaries 15 that is of the most inefficient we can imagine at the Biodiversity Foundation 8.5 million at the Biodiversity Foundation for real investments 14 million Forests Without Borders 30,000 Eurites Fademur 129 000 Eurites the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces 172 000 Eurites So one after the other one after the other you give to the various chiringuitos that I have been able to quickly collect about 37 million euros and instead of favoring our industry our field and our productive sectors what you do is favoring your friends Please ask the Spanish whether we want their nonsense or whether on the contrary we want a reasonable energy policy which is what you should bring us here Thank you so much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,32.94145,24.67037,14,"thank much madam president debating section general budgets state referring ministry ecological transition

#SantiagoAbascalConde,Thank you very much Madam President Mr. Sánchez you have spoken for an hour and a half and you have said many things but it is essential that we begin by saying one It does n't matter what you say in this rostrum in fact it does n't matter what you say And while it is outside the debate that is before us today it is worth remembering a few words those that said philosophy must return to the classrooms That is the commitment of the Government studying it is vital to understand each other and to develop critical thinking that will help us to face injustices These are his literal words of the year 2018 and the government has just guaranteed the disappearance of the philosophy of the classrooms Mr Sánchez Mr. Sanchez you fight up to philosophy perhaps because you do n't want the schoolchildren to know who Socrates was because the sophists killed him,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,37.368458,18.335255,14,thank much madam president mr. sánchez spoken hour half said many things essential begin saying one n't matter say rostrum fact n't matter say outside debate us today worth remembering words said philosophy must return classrooms commitment government studying vital understand develop critical thinking help us face injustices literal words year 2018 government guaranteed disappearance philosophy classrooms mr sánchez mr. sanchez fight philosophy perhaps n't want schoolchildren know socrates sophists killed
#SantiagoAbascalConde,Mr. Sanchez I admit I can't help it You come up here and talk to me about training What do you want me to call you Dr. Sanchez or Dr. Sanchez Or are both titles as fraudulent as your government presidency I have to say with concern I understand that it is a waste that you have missed a very good occasion today speaking of borders of security of talking about what is happening to our compatriots in Melilla at this very moment As you intervened at nine and a half hours the Melilla fence has been attacked by two thousand people illegally who have passed over our guards and our police probably because another one on this occasion the one in Morocco has once again perceived the weakness of our Government and our institutions as well as Putin It is a good time that you have failed to say that in Spain too we have serious problems and that our own army could deploy on our southern border in Ceuta and Melilla to defend the territorial integrity and security of our compatriots even if you laugh And it is also a good time for you all to rectify and come back to the point that Ceuta and Melilla are under the protection of the Atlantic Alliance Mr Sánchez I will reiterate what I have said to you because you have given me the feeling that my message has not been made clear to you I have told you that you are not credible not reliable that your Government is not respectable You have appealed to international legality which has been violated by Putin Of course but it is done by a president who before appealing to international legality should be able to respect the constitutional legality that he has violated and that he has been accredited in three rulings of the Constitutional Court You have appealed to unity and I do not know what message you can get to Ukraine or to the European institutions with a government clearly divided and faced right now Therefore you are not credible and I say this with concern because you have made reference to the calls you have made to the Ukrainian President to the various calls you have made and I have bothered to read the thanks that the President of Ukraine has made on social networks during the last days of all the international leaders who have called him from the American or European Union leaders and even our neighbors in Portugal and there is no reference to Mr Sánchez 's call They may have the concern of a firm and clear position of the Government of Spain taking into account what its partners are who sit on the blue bench and in those red seats where Putin 's Communist allies are On the other hand I am not going to refute each and every one of the lies that you have raised about VOX in this rostrum and that you consistently raise on most occasions with the help of the media in relation to our international alliances or in relation to our position before the refugees There is no discrimination Mr Sánchez is that we distinguish between those who are refugees and those who are not we distinguish between refugees who flee from war and who must be welcomed and those waves of men sent in a well premeditated manner to destabilise nations and to assault borders we distinguish it perfectly Mr Sánchez there is no discrimination whatsoever On the other hand even if I 'm not going to answer all your lies I do want to give you a thought Did the VOX lie strategy work for them Do VOX demonization work for them Because they 've been perpetrating since 2018 and we have 0 voting intent At each general choice the backup of VOX increases to 10 to 15 and you continue to lie and demonize VOX Already in the polls we are over 20 stepping on their heels and very soon ahead of you Mr Sánchez because the Spaniards are sick of their lies and that you insult millions of voters with the demonisation they make of VOX That said Mr Sánchez I am going to say goodbye with the literal words of a socialist we have communists in the government and having communists implies a distancing mistrust and a distance from the first Western powers The president of the United States is told that if he gives data to Spain that data can reach Venezuela Cuba Russia or Iran because there are ministers of political parties who share that ideology We are the only country in Western Europe that has communists in the government and a parliamentary majority based on all the issues that can further horrify a democratic government We have communists alliances with terrorist groups and then they are part of that majority not only separatist parties but parties linked to Colombian narco guerrillas which is the case of the Communist Party a Secretary of State who is a member of the Government that has been a lawyer for Colombian guerrillas in their negotiations What else this socialist asks can we expect from our allies who have a distrust and a rejection of what we can represent Well these are the words of that socialist to whom you have expelled from Spanish socialism Mr

#IvánEspinosaDeLosMonterosDeSimón,Thank you Madam President I begin by drinking water to overcome the drink that the secretary general of the Communist Party accuses us of communists which is the last thing I needed to see in this House So far the Comedy Club Go talk to your communist friends around the world with the FARC with the Venezuelans with Putin 's allies and with Putin who is his ally but do n't come here and make jokes because that 's already in very bad taste Look we 're talking about the state of the nation debate It is a debate that has been taking place since 1983 as has already been said in this House Except in electoral years it has been an annual meeting in which we have always been able to take stock of serious things not what we are hearing now about what is happening in this country With Felipe González the debate on the state of the nation came to be held ten times Mr Aznar and Mr Zapatero celebrated it in six Mr Rajoy in three but Pedro Sánchez resists calling It has been four years but it has not given us time as the secretary general of the Communist Party tells us because it has been a little hasty There has n't been time in four years Well that 's why of course it 's not because of lack of conviction The very words of Mr. Pedro Sánchez are very eloquent I remind them when they were in the opposition because as they do not remember and they then said in the opposition Pedro Sánchez himself A lot of transparency law he said but the government confirms that this year there will be no debate on the state of the nation I mean Mr. Sánchez was in favour of celebrating it At that time when he said so it had only been seven months since the formation of this Government not seven years Nor should it be for lack of reason to justify it because there is plenty to justify this debate such as the policy of the pacts of this Government which is proving lethal for Spain all that is needed is to listen to the Secretary General of the Communist Party We have not just digested that Spain is the only country in the civilized world where there are communists in a government this is something we have very easily normalized Sánchez has given the rule of law to people like you Mr Santiago you who have never believed in the Constitution or in freedom or democracy He has approved pardons for people like you who have never believed in the nation either He has allied himself with ages people like you who have the past that you have and that we all remember All just to approve their budgets He has signed the departure of Spaniards from the classrooms of the schools of Catalonia He broke the one size fits all Social Security box He has surrendered by signing the departure of the Civil Guard in Navarre Why talk about your economic policy It has placed Spain as the most backward country from the crisis in the Western world The unemployment rate is again the highest in Europe GDP suffered the biggest fall in Europe Moreover I will repeat this to the Socialists because they have not heard it well the biggest fall in GDP since the Civil War and it is not Franco 's it is yours Socialists to put on how you put on Inflation is 7.4 the highest in thirty three years The debt is the highest in history the Spaniards are more indebted than they have ever been Institutional deterioration is rampant The Democracy Index 2021 has gone from considering our country a full democracy to calling it defective a real shame for all Spaniards Violence and crime have returned to our neighbourhoods and we have suffered the greatest migratory invasions since the years of the Green March Spain has seen its weight sink into the world until it became the laughing stock of the West partly because of the fear generated by the fact that we actually have the only government in the civilized world with communists within it I could go on because the reasons for this debate remain but Pedro Sánchez does not want this House to debate the situation in Spain and precisely that is the most obvious reason for the deep and systematic disregard of the government of Pedro Sánchez for this House and for the role of the legislature The juggling of Congress and its postponement to a secondary and marginal role in Spanish politics represents only the tip of the sanchest drift iceberg which is nothing more than the continuous and permanent deterioration and destabilization of State institutions which puts them at the service not of a government and a party but simply of an individual Pedro Sánchez We have warned on many occasions we have suffered a rapid devaluation of our institutional framework and that must ignite all the alarms We have seen it with the Prosecutor 's Office with the attempts to submit to the judiciary with the taking of power of the Court of Auditors with collaborationism of course with the Attorney General 's Office with the CNMC with the partisan use of CIS or Spanish Broadcasting and of course with the none of the transparency laws to which Pedro Sánchez himself referred Those of us who believe in democracy know that with the maintenance and integrity of the good functioning of our institutions we play a great role We therefore believe that this debate is appropriate I am concerned yes that VOX has on many occasions been the only voice that has been heard in this House to denounce the things that this Government has been doing the only one who has obtained the protection of the Constitutional Court in defence of the need to maintain the control activity of the Government during the confinement the only one who has denounced the abuse of the Royal Decree Law by this Government the only one who has been denouncing the absence of ministers in the control sessions to the Government or the only one who has not ceased to denounce the blackmail that it means sending to Brussels a recovery plan without having approved it in this house which is who should have approved it,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,33.00853,24.570757,14,thank madam president begin drinking water overcome drink secretary general communist party accuses us communists last thing

#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen The representative of Esquerra referred earlier to the poem of Salvador Puig Antich about which silence did not gag his name Silence has gagged the memory of Mrs. de Esquerra who forgot that he was executed not because he was an anarchist but because he had killed a policeman The policeman was Francisco Anguas and was twenty four years old I imagine you recognize him because he spoke many times from this rostrum It is of course José Calvo Sotelo He was killed by socialist policemen who that same night tried to kill also José MaríaGil Robles but they did not find him at his home In other words in this regime that its law presents as a luminous democracy destroyed by fascism law enforcement officials killed opposition leaders By the way Calvo Sotelo does not count as a victim for the purposes of this law because his period of application starts on July 18 and he was killed on July 13 With this skillful cornering of the times they manage to ignore the 3,000 victims of political violence of the period 1931 1936 a violence starred mostly by the left and in which stand out the 1400 dead of the evil so called Revolution of Asturias in fact failed attempt of socialist coup d'état against the previous electoral victory of the right That revolution was led by Francisco Largo Caballero and Indalecio Prieto among others which has not prevented both of them from having statues in the New Ministries Another socialist the great Julián Besteiro then said to them You will come to power if you arrive soaked and red in blood This is a law that VOX will repeal if it comes to the government By the way it is a pity that the People 's Party with an absolute majority does not derogate from the previous law it is a pity that the People 's Party does not repeal the Andalusian law of equivalent content today We will repeal it because it is a law worthy of Orwell and Orwell wrote in his book 1984 The party could extend its hand to the past and say that such or such event had never occurred This was much more horrible than torture and death so far the date And in fact erasing the victims of conservative Spain 's media from public memory is like killing them for the second time No one in this whole session has yet talked about the victims killed by the Popular Front in the 1930s So I 'm going to remind you of some deaths that according to your law never happened He 's less known he 's Florentino Asensio",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,38.55361,21.859407,14,"good afternoon ladies gentlemen representative esquerra referred earlier poem salvador puig antich silence gag name silence gagged memory mrs. de esquerra forgot executed anarchist killed policeman policeman francisco anguas twenty four years old imagine recognize spoke many times rostrum course josé calvo sotelo killed socialist policemen night tried kill also josé maríagil robles find home words regime law presents luminous democracy destroyed fascism law enforcement officials killed opposition leaders way calvo sotelo count victim purposes law period application starts july 18 killed july 13 skillful cornering times manage ignore 3,000 victims political violence period 1931 1936 violence starred mostly left stand 1400 dead evil called revolution asturias fact failed attempt socialist coup d'état previous electoral victory right revolution led francisco largo caballero indalecio prieto among others prevented statues new ministries another socialist great julián besteiro said come power arrive soaked red blood law vox repeal comes government way pity people 's party absolute majority derogate previous law pity people 's party repeal andalusian law equivalent content today repeal law worthy orwell orwell wrote book 1984 party could extend hand past say event never occurred much horrible torture death far date fact erasing victims conservative spain 's media public memory like killing second time one whole session yet talked victims killed popular front 1930s 'm going remind deaths according law never happened 's less known 's florentino asensio"
#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,He was Bishop of Barbastro in 1936 and on July 22 those who in your opinion defended democracy cut off his testicles and left him bleeding for a whole night He died forgiving his murderers we bring him here as a representative of the 6800 priests and nuns and tens of thousands of segros killed by whom in your opinion they defended democracy and human rights This is Melquiades Alvarez They will recognize you because there is a bust of yours in the hallway and it is that you presided over this House He founded the Liberal Democratic Republican Party but his republican status did not save him from being killed by Republicans in Model Prison By the way of the eight ministers of the Republic killed in the Civil War seven were killed by the Popular Front The deaths of Alvarez and Asensio do fall within the time frame covered by the rule but their exclusion from the status of victims is determined by the manicheo approach of the explanatory statement in whose light the law must be interpreted a explanatory statement explaining that the Republican side represented democracy and human rights and how could the good people 's side commit any crime The understanding underlying the whole law is that victims must by definition be left wing and right wing victims For all this this is a totalitarian law not only because of the way it divides the Spaniards and their ancestors into good and bad but also because of the way it seeks to suppress the natural diversity of opinions on historical issues In a free country citizens are free to reach their own views on history on the basis of their own readings In a free country historians are free to disagree You seek to suppress this plurality by imposing by decree a sectarian historical account But they are also going to pass this law by the hand of Bildu and Bildu has demanded the extension of the period of application until 1983 You are batasunization the memory you are assuming the historical account of the extreme left a story according to which the Transition did not really exist the Transition would have been nothing more than a continuation of Francoism by other means and what is more serious the 388 murders committed by the ETA between 1976 and 1983 would become interpretable as democratic resistance to Francoist governments of Adolfo Suárez or Felipe González Article 4 of the law states that the law is based on the right to moral reparation of the losers the losers of 1939 We believe that the vanquished side has already been restored to its rights by numerous laws of the 1970s and 1980s Military graduations right to pensions buildings were returned to the unions and left wing parties There was a true reconciliation prepared by gestures of concord from decades ago For example the declaration of the Communist Party of Spain in 1956 in favour of reconciliation between the Spanish or the approach given by the Franco regime to the celebration of the twenty five

#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,It was a non-sectarian approach an approach that does not emphasize victory or war but the twenty five years of later peace and prosperity As for the Valley of the Fallen which we do not know if you intend to destroy or merely resignify well it does not need resignification because from the beginning it was a monument not to the Franco victory but to the last twinning of the fallen on both sides beyond death That is why it is not presided over by a statue of Franco what presides over the monument is not a statue of Franco it is a cross Ladies and gentlemen 146 of our predecessors who occupied these same seats were killed in the Civil War 75 were killed by the People 's Front 71 were killed by the national side to which would have to be added 33 executed in the post war processes On their behalf we ask you not to pass this law Do n't resurrect a cainism that cost us so much We will recover the spirit of the Transition,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,39.80689,20.81999,14,non-sectarian approach approach emphasize victory war twenty five years later peace prosperity valley fallen know intend destroy merely resignify well need resignification beginning monument franco victory last twinning fallen sides beyond death presided statue franco presides monument statue franco cross ladies gentlemen 146 predecessors occupied seats killed civil war 75 killed people 's front 71 killed national side would added 33 executed post war processes behalf ask pass law n't resurrect cainism cost us much recover spirit transition

#FranciscoJoséContrerasPeláez,Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen In 1974 a year before Franco 's death Dolores Ibarruri the Passionary gave an interview to a French magazine There he said the following We have waited for 39 years we may have to wait for some more but I promise you that after our revenge will last 40 voices 40 years This 40 times 40 reminds me of the thousand year old Reich thing does n't it But what I want to say to you gentlemen of the left is that initiatives like the one you bring us today seem to give fulfillment to the Passionary 's promise because they are not inspired by compassion but by the desire for revenge the need to rewrite Orwellian history and the pathological claim to win at last the Civil War after 83 years of its end That 's why we 're going to vote against it We will always vote against initiatives of historical hemipléjica memory that pay tribute only to the dead of one side while ignoring the other In fact the purpose of such initiatives is not to pay tribute to the dead but to fix in the minds of all Spaniards an equation that says Right Killer Left Victim By the way the reconstruction of the facts they include in their GNP leaves much to be desired I recommend reading the definitive work on the fall of Malaga and La Desbandá which has been written by the Professor of Contemporary History of the University of Malaga Antonio Nadal who has devoted 30 years of his career to researching those facts For example why do n't you tell us what happened in Malaga in the months preceding the capture of the city by Franco 's troops when Malaga was at the mercy of militias of the Popular Front who murdered 3406 people according to the meticulous account of Angel David Martín Rubio for the mere fact of being Catholic or right wing They did not burn any church because they had all been burned in May 1931 Well eight thousand of those militiamen eight thousand militiamen fled to Almería on the Malaga road as Franco 's troops mixed with civilian populations approached That 's not what I 'm saying or Nadal 's saying This is stated in the report containing the conclusions of the investigation conducted by the Government of the Republic itself after the fall of Malaga The report speaks of deaths from hunger deaths from exhaustion Interestingly there 's no talk of bombing deaths In other words La Desbandá seems to have consisted basically of a great humanitarian catastrophe motivated by the logistical unprevision of the republican side In fact the apocalyptic version of La Desbandá as a deliberate massacre is based on the testimony of a single person the communist doctor Norman Bethune who has been evoked here several times who was not on the road he was in Almeria that is at the point of destination by the way he was expelled from the Red Cross years later for dishonest behavior towards the nurses But let us imagine that you were right and that indeed the Francoist side had committed war crimes against the refugees by bombing the road We stand out from you in admitting the crimes on both sides Why do n't they make initiatives that embrace our sides that include the victims of both sides If they did we would be willing to try to believe that they do so by seeking peace piety forgiveness and not sectarianism In this sense I make a suggestion to you Why do they not declare a place of democratic memory in addition to the Malaga road the ravine of Can Trinxet There passed in February 1939 another withdrawal the definitive after Franco took Barcelona and a column of militiamen who guarded forty two prisoners on the national side was stopped in this ravine on February 9 1939 The French border was already very close the war was already lost to the Republican side and they could have taken them to French territory and freed them there But no the militiamen preferred to shoot the forty two prisoners among them were the bishop of Teruel Anselmo Polanco and the military commander of Teruel Colonel Rey d'Harcourt Any initiative that consists in using the dead almost ninety years ago and only those on one side to turn them into the political weapon of the present is nothing more than to sow hatred again among Spaniards and they will never count on us to support this Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,39.62258,20.904066,14,good afternoon ladies gentlemen 1974 year

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much Mr President Do n't worry today I did n't bring the iron bar and the chain with which the emigrants beat the police no need All I had to do was teach them the fork so that all of you would cry out Wow a weapon that has brought the VOX one Preliminary question Mr President Putin 's tyrant is applauded and supported by the Puebla Group to which several ministers of this Government and a Secretary of State belong Nothing more to add This motion as a result of the urgent inquiry we presented last week is a further consequence not the cause of the serious situation in Spain and Europe It is not necessary for us to retell the ten lies that we had to point out from this rostrum last week at least I will announce them so that they have no doubt One Ceuta and Melilla are not Morocco they have never been and never will be Two refugees are not peaceful refugees they are violent assailant young people from our borders Three Morocco does not help border control Morocco collaborates with these jumps Morocco blackmails in exchange for money to the Government of Spain Morocco causes an invasion by substitution in the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and in the Canary Islands Four the fence is not safe As has already been said here today the minister has been putting the appropriate means both in the fence itself with the so called inverted combs or as proposed by this group raising the fence to the necessary two meters and now hurry and run tells us that in three months he will solve it Five the agents of the state security forces and bodies the National Police the Civil Guard the local police of Ceuta and Melilla do not have the appropriate means and when they have them like the anti-disturbing means they are not allowed to use them Six pseudo NGOs are not humanitarian NGOs they are part of the plot of the human trafficking mafias who use human tragedy as a business Seven the Armed Forces can play a very important and very necessary role in the control of our borders they are trained and have the means for mass control you just have to give them the order Eight NATO the North Atlantic Treaty does not protect the borders of Europe the borders of Spain in Ceuta and Melilla because they are squares that are not covered as requested by this group by Article 6 and as my colleague Rocío de Meer reminded the People 's Party the solution is not to open the borders with the inclusion of Ceuta and Melilla in the Schengen agreement but in Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty Nine it is not true that the media inform about what is happening in our cities of Ceuta and Melilla but manipulate that information always demonizing the agents criminalizing them and making it seem like those who assault do it with roses and flowers rather than with forks and iron bars And finally illegal immigration is not good illegal immigration causes labor saturation of public services the other is good legal immigration The amendments of the People 's Party and the Citizens Party to our motion are clearly rejected The People 's Party turns its absurd position into a contradiction to the same motion we heard a few minutes ago It tells us in its amendment that we have to withdraw the paragraph in which we say that there must be collaboration involvement of the Armed Forces in border control and they have just said in the previous motion that what is needed is coordination with the Armed Forces Agree among the different sectors of your party Of course the participation of the Armed Forces is necessary Of course we will not accept that amendment And to Citizens what am I going to say Smoke The only thing that is correct is what he repeats in his motion and the rest incongruity Here what we are talking about and that is the important thing is respect for national sovereignty and security that which is lacking in Europe that sovereignty and that respect for the security of the borders that we are demanding for the Ukrainian people for the terrible genocidal invasion of the tyrant communist dictator of Putin For that freedom for the Ukrainian people that sovereignty and that respect for the borders that the ministers and government partners do not want to respect by supporting Putin from this group we say that we want a Europe with secure borders that we want a Europe where the sovereignty of nations is respected And to all the globalist progress of the extreme left of the left and of the cowardly right that buys the globalist discourse we tell you that Europe will only survive if it has strong nations that defend themselves from permanent threats And security is also talking today about security in the streets internal security in our nations That 's why we say No to the youth gangs that are causing violence on our streets not to the menas that are causing violence on our streets and not to the illegal illegal and violent immigrants who have assaulted our borders and who are causing insecurity on our streets And to talk about security of course is also to talk about energy security which is why this Saturday thousands of Spaniards millions of Spaniards are going to concentrate before all the municipalities We want energy security energy sovereignty so we do n't depend on any outside satraps that can cut our electricity gas or oil And we want food security so that our farmers and farmers can feed Spain and we do n't have the risk that foreign products will ruin them or that foreign political decisions will close our borders And finally we want legal certainty so that there are no coupsmen who give coups d'état and governments who indulgate that security and sovereignty ladies and gentlemen is what it is security at our borders,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,34.441494,19.010973,14,thank much mr president n't worry today n't bring iron bar chain emigrants beat police need teach fork would cry wow weapon brought

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,"Thank you very much Madam President Minister this urgent inquiry could have been carried out a month ago six months ago eight months ago a year ago two years ago and sadly if you continue in the government it would be repeated in two six or eight months or one year and it would be worse and worse We have already talked about this we have already denounced this but I will only refer to what has happened and hence its urgency in the last week When Mr Sánchez taught us about the importance in defending the borders of Europe when he denounced the illegitimate invading aggression of the satrap Putin only Santiago Abascal president of the political party that is already Spain 's second political force in intent to vote denounced what was happening at the same time on the borders of Spain an assault of 2500 illegal immigrants 450 of whom managed to enter Meanwhile her representative the government delegate in Melilla was calmly gathered to teach the Civil Guard commanders gender ideology lessons What a big issue when they 're assaulting a border The next day the minister on Thursday last week had already bet 4,000 illegal immigrants on the mountains of Morocco on the Gurugu From that assault of 1200 they managed to enter about 400 And just yesterday Minister they assaulted another 200 of those who managed to enter 50 Result almost a thousand illegal immigrants have entered absolutely violently across the southern border of Spain the southern border of Europe in Melilla There are half a hundred wounded agents and about 5000 white weapons have been collected by the State Security Forces and Bodies iron forks bars chains boats with live lime Minister I would like to speak today not for you who knows it perfectly well but for the Spanish political and public opinion on behalf of our group to denounce the ten flagrant lies to which your Government the partners of your Government the progress consensus and the media on pay of all of you reiterate over and over again First great historical lie Ceuta and Melilla are not Morocco Ceuta and Melilla have never been Morocco and Ceuta and Melilla will never be Morocco because before Morocco existed specifically 541 years before Morocco existed Ceuta was already part of the sovereignty and national territory and 460 years before Morocco existed Melilla was already a Spanish city Second big lie It is not true that they are peaceful refugees they are violent young people They are not women they are not children they are not elderly they are young violent perfectly organized who assault with rusty and sharp iron claws with chains with iron bars with live lime They are not as we are unfortunately seeing poor Ukrainians who fled women children elderly and sick from the invasion of Putin 's communist satrap They are perfectly organized young men of military age Third big lie It is not true that Morocco cooperates That 's not true Morocco is preparing and organizing the assaults as it pleases it according to two clear objectives The first you know it well Minister is economic blackmail to Spain Every time he pressures Spain they run out of the government to offer new sums of money such as the 30 million euros paid to him last year 30 million euros when there was an assault of 10 000 illegal immigrants in Ceuta or the 26 million that they have just approved for off road vehicles for the Moroccan government after the last assaults at the border And the second objective is the demographic pressure they carry out on Spanish cities to achieve an invasion by substitution so that there will come a time when the number of Moroccans in those cities is higher than that of Spaniards and to claim as their own cities that are not The CNI has already told us in a report which you know so well Morocco does not cooperate it is a latent threat Fourth big lie It 's not true that we have a secure border Only 850 meters from the 12 kilometers of the border of Melilla have the height of 10 meters and the sufficient control systems that avoid the jumps Those famous inverted combs that were going to put as a mid-coastal in the rest of kilometers have been put only in one part and in all the places where they are missing is where they have jumped In addition you know that there is a budget of 32 million euros What are they waiting for to execute him With 32 million euros the Spanish border between Melilla and Ceuta would be almost entirely shielded I say 32 million when I just mentioned that almost 50 million have been given to the Moroccan satrap Fifth lie It is not true that our agents are sure as much as you run down to take the picture with them neither the Civil Guard nor the National Police nor even the local police They have insufficient human resources even if you send in timely reinforcements There is no permanent supply they do not have riot control material they do not have vehicles with a water launcher they do not have the appropriate vests or regulatory helmets not a 20 year old helmets that break as we could see at the first blow with a chain they do not have passive safety they do not have adequate vests or anti-corruption material That 's why there are fifty officers injured Friday It is not true that they are humanitarian NGOs They are part of the human trafficking mafia that mafia you know that in Africa collects huge amounts of money from immigrants before the jump and their families in debt for life And then there are the pseudo NGOs on the other side doing the effect called and charging for every emigrant they pick up at the border There 's a business on one side of the border and a business on the other side They are the same the same NGOs that I could see the other day in Melilla bet on a small mountain waiting for the place of the jump because they know it perfectly and photographing and filming the actions of the agents who then properly cut filtering to the media only the part that interests them that is when the agents defend themselves from the brutal aggression that they are suffering with forks They are the same Minister the same pseudo NGOs that pressure governments to empty Melilla 's CETI yes the one they emptied a little while ago Do you remember Two unprotected ships that left the port of Melilla and went to the port of Malaga opened the door and released them there without any police control Do you remember It was 1500 You 've emptied the CETI I was there and the workers told me as soon as they empty the CETI there will again be assaults That said and done at two weeks they were jumping That 's the business they have that 's the effect called Seventh lie It is not true that the Armed Forces cannot have a very necessary and very proportional participation The Armed Forces Minister you know it too I have been told by the military commanders the police commanders regularly receive mass control courses have anti-disturbing material and are perfectly prepared in the Navy Infantry in Regulars in the Legion Why do n't you give the order so there 's 1500 or 2,000 soldiers with anti-disturbing material helping in the jump Eight It is not true that Ceuta and Melilla are protected by our allies in the North Atlantic Treaty It 's not And when we have recently requested in the Senate that a petition be made for its inclusion under the umbrella of Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty they have voted against his Government and all the partners of his Government It is not true that the Armed Forces on just reciprocity with their NATO partners are fulfilling the commitments of the Cardiff Summit to maintain a 2 defence budget Do you know what Morocco is in Yes you do It already carries 3.2 of annual gross domestic product in defence expenditure Do you know where Spain is You know that too We do n't get to 1.02 a year Faced with this violation of our defence capacity the enemies of Spain are also exploited Nine great lie It is not true that the media neither the 1 nor the 2 nor the Fourth nor the Sixth nor any with the exception of many exceptions are telling the truth They manipulate the images they take out only the court that interests them they never take out when the agents are assaulted and wounded And I ask you here publicly Minister to give the order that always not only when the situation is overrun all the images of the fixed video towers on the borders of Ceuta and Melilla which take out the helicopters of Civil Guard and National Police and especially that it equips all the agents of individual GoPro cameras so that they can film all the performances Tenth lie Minister It is not true that illegal immigration is good for Spain That 's not true They do n't come to pay our pensions they cost us a fortune They do n't bring wealth They do n't pay taxes They destabilise the labour market But that 's what the mafias are interested in because that 's how they have cheap labor to work in the field to work in the industry They are the new slaves of the 21st century In addition Minister the public services of the Spaniards are saturated hospitals health centres are saturated public security services are saturated because these public security services are needed The issue of illegal immigration is being addressed and other issues such as insecurity on the streets are being neglected In addition they generate insecurity And finally social services are also saturated Do you know what is true Minister Do you know what a fine truth is that neither your media nor your political propaganda will ever be able to shut up That you are doing a so called brutal effect that is calling on the whole of Africa to storm the border that you are unprotecting the borders of Spain and that you have therefore unprotected the Spaniards Thank you very much",#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,33.678886,18.949883,14,"thank much madam president minister urgent

#FranciscoJavierOrtegaSmithMolina,Thank you very much Madam President The facts that we were able to see both in Melilla and through the explanations of the lieutenant colonel of the Civil Guard and from the vision of the different videos are as follows on 24 June there is a violent assault on the border of Spain the southern border of Europe perfectly coordinated massive and disproportionate to the number of our agents and provided in their response First an assault is not a legal entry it is not an entry allowed by a border crossing enabled for this purpose Therefore those who stress the need for attention to possible asylum applications are once again carrying out an obvious so called effect which says that any border can be assaulted by any point violently and that this gives them all kinds of rights Second it was a violent assault It was noted that once again and it is not the first Minister I myself in this rostrum presented to your ladies and gentlemen the forks before whom Members of your own party exclaimed how you are allowed to enter this Chamber with weapons axes electric radials forks sticks with sharp tips of iron and clubs all kinds of blunt material were used And he was violent also in the result fifty five officers wounded with bruises with breaks and one of them was unconscious Third it was a perfectly coordinated violent assault The image we have seen on other occasions It gives the impression that they had been instructed by military units Perfectly coordinated the advance changing successively the place of attack or assault some directing the assault others harassing the agents throwing stones throwing sticks on other occasions living lime others proceeding to the opening of the holes with radials and while some covered the front others working at the entrance and others proceeding to the massive entrance to the assault with the aim of reaching our territory In addition to coordinating the assault was absolutely massive It 's not random It is no coincidence that 2500 assailants decide to come one day at the same time and at the same point It is therefore an assault with a numerical superiority which they know perfectly well and which gives them a clear advantage over the security forces and bodies of the State which have the duty obligation and responsibility to ensure the security of all Spaniards and therefore to ensure our borders And fifth it was an absolutely disproportionate attack on the number because as I say compared to the 2500 assailants on the other side at the best of times adding to the Civil Guard the National Police and the local police there were 120 officers There were moments when we could appreciate in particular when they were breaking one of the doors as on one side on the side of Morocco there were about 1500 assailants and on the Spanish side only twelve brave agents of the Civil Guard And we defend the response of our agents once again as we have already had to defend in this very rostrum by referring to other assaults on our border and therefore assaults on our national sovereignty as we also had to defend from this rostrum their response to other assaults and attacks on our national sovereignty as was the coup d'état in Catalonia in 2017 where our agents also had to suffer that violence and that disproportionate number Mr Minister what you cannot say as Minister of the Interior is what you have just said that there were more than 120 agents and boasting about it I say there were only 120 agents in front of a brutal avalanche of 2500 violent assailants What you can't say as you just said was that there was an important deployment because there were drones a helicopter that had to leave the service to go refuel because there was no other one to support it and only 120 agents at best One of the great lies that you have given to those who hate Spain the separatists the thugs the friends of the terrorists is that they can go on saying that they had died in our territory I 'm going to tell you something that no one in this House has told you and that they probably wo n't tell you What if there were them what Is it that those of us who suffer an assault are responsible for themselves in that assault who die violent people whether our agents for saving their lives make legitimate use of force In this case there were no dead but believe me minister if there were no dead it was a miracle It was a miracle because in the face of a totally brutal avalanche they could have been killed in Spanish territory But here the dead those who appeared dead in this case yes were very alive and we could see in the images I will tell your lordships that they did not have the opportunity to see and all the Spaniards how some of those dead resurrected They had violently jumped the border and our agents tried to remove them from the accumulation of assailants By passing out they were placed on one side of the road so that the health services could come and oh surprise we all saw in the cameras how the slightest carelessness of our agents got up and ran out to CETI Those are the dead we had in our territory To all those who have accused our state security forces and forces I would like to hear them claim dead demand and denounce police violence and negligence against Morocco not our Civil Guard or our National Police The result Minister is that abandonment which you have been subjected to at the border with Spain because you tell me that there were 120 agents when as we have seen on the Moroccan side there should probably be between 500 and 600 agents Minister in an assault of 2500 illegal immigrants our forces and state security forces can say very loudly that they managed to get only six hundred to jump into Spanish territory and managed to return reject to 470 Thus of the 2500 only 130 managed to enter the territory and creanos if the Government were not theirs and ours of those 130 there was not one left right now in Spanish territory Minister I would like to end with two questions The first one of justice congratulating the forces and security forces of the State the Civil Guard the National Police and the local police of Melilla for their professionalism for their loyalty to Spain for their courage And I want to say to you Minister that you are not worthy of the magnificent agents we have in Spain That 's why you must resign And you must resign because you have abandoned them not because of the slanders that the coup groups terrorists and flounders pour against you and your Government but because you have abandoned our agents on the border with Spain Thank you very much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,32.93662,18.943804,14,thank much madam president facts able see

#IgnacioGilLázaro,Thank you Madam President Minister we knew you were a bad minister but you have shown us today that as a diviner it is even worse The facts are the facts Inadequate material and human means temporary patching of troops when circumstances tighten as now inability to adequately defend our police and civilian guards because you forbid them from using anti-disturbing material and a systematic erratic policy turned into fact called are the causes of the events occurring at the southern border And the bottom line is that above all some of you allow yourselves to doubt the proven professionalism of our bodies and security forces It is intolerable that the Communist faction of the Government following the wake of certain NGOs serving the interests of the mafias demand resignation and investigation for what happened in Melilla It is absolutely intolerable it is inconceivable that you make certain statements simply trying to disguise reality to protect yourself It is inconceivable that the director general of the Civil Guard should stand in Melilla and recommend tranquillity because she says that according to her all the mechanisms of the State have worked perfectly when in just two days almost a thousand sub-Saharans have entered or that you dare to literally describe the policy with Morocco as perfect and adequate when the facts prove otherwise the police unions deny it and it is also known that in Morocco no one enters or leaves if Morocco does not want to Today there is an emergency situation on the southern border You know that it will be accentuated in the coming months and VOX already demands the deployment of our Armed Forces in defense of the southern border a policy of firmness with Morocco and the demand to NATO of the guarantee of defense of our cities of Ceuta and Melilla if that is the case That is essential as much as throwing this erratic and useless government away,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,34.155556,19.89188,14,thank madam president minister knew bad minister shown us today diviner even worse facts facts inadequate material human means temporary patching troops circumstances tighten inability adequately defend police civilian guards forbid using anti-disturbing material systematic erratic policy turned fact called causes events occurring southern border bottom line allow doubt proven professionalism bodies security forces intolerable communist faction government following wake certain ngos serving interests mafias demand resignation investigation happened melilla absolutely intolerable inconceivable make certain statements simply trying disguise reality protect inconceivable director general civil guard stand melilla recommend tranquillity says according mechanisms state worked perfectly two days almost thousand sub-saharans entered dare literally describe policy morocco perfect adequate facts prove otherwise police unions deny also known morocco one enters leaves morocco want today emergency situation southern border know accentuated coming months vox already demands deployment armed forces defense southern border policy firmness morocco demand nato guarantee defense cities ceuta melilla case essential much throwing erratic useless government away

#MaríaTeresaLópezÁlvarez,"Thank you President Lord Great Marlaska do n't be frightened you 've seen me go up to the rostrum and put a scared fugitive face that you do n't know where to run Do n't worry calm down please although I understand that it 's not easy for you as it's the lockdown of Morocco a country for you partner and friend that promises to contain illegal immigration in exchange for a few bizums of millionaire amounts to then leave you totally unprotected and even guilty when the misfortune produces in the area bordering the sea with the Moroccan village of Beni Ensar In other words the tragedy occurs in the fence yes which Morocco has installed by reusing the concertinas that you removed from the fences of Ceuta and Melilla to put its feathers inverted some feathers inverted that by the way so much headache are giving it The area that is close to the so called Chinese neighborhood in Melilla is also an area where there are still no inverted combs its great failure Anyway to what I was going what a small move the Alawite king has made It is what you have to rely on in a country with little scruple and much arrogance which you are not able to stop Because those two thousand immigrants traveled a hundred kilometers to reach first Mount Gurugu and set up their camps there until they waited for the moment of the assault and then headed for the Beni Enzar area adjacent to Melilla And when is the performance of the Moroccan gendarmes taking place to stop that avalanche All these immigrants leave organized at six in the morning from the skirt of Mount Gurugú and from there to the vicinity of the Beni Enzar border there are more than 5 kilometers Could n't the Moroccan Police act there Did you have to wait until they got to Beni Enzar to see dawn on the way at six in the morning In short Morocco is taking the plunge plundering the pocket of Spain and Europe by making the paripé on foot pretending to be a police officer of legal immigration and you are there justifying your policy and your friendship with the Alawite Kingdom Mr Marlaska Spain cannot leave immigration control and the protection of its sovereignty in the hands of a third country let alone a country which has already shown that it is not reliable As much as you and your official statistics regarding immigration flows continue to conceal the actual number of immigrants who entered Ceuta between 17 and 18 May 2021 the reality is that it is and more than twelve thousand illegals entered Ceuta in less than forty eight hours and it was the Moroccan gendarmes who pushed Moroccan subjects to cross Ceuta And at the height of absurdity you leave Morocco control of immigration By the way none of your subsidized media has helped much in this scheme They all published that the tragedy was in the Melilla fence And the NGOs who also profit from public money have not helped him either In fact for example in 2022 the Spanish Refugee Aid Commission received a subsidy from the Ministry of Inclusion Social Security and Migration of € 23750,000 But it is one of those non-governmental organizations that accuses you of using violence to defend our borders In the face of this pressure I imagine that you will have already planned to increase the subsidy a little further in the State General Budgets by 2023 a little wo n't you Mr Marlaska And for your sake those who have sat you on the bench of defendants today to explain are your other partners these partners who are the life insurance of this government to stay in power coups separatists and heirs of ETA You 're surrounded by the best of every house Mr. Marlaska Of course Mr Marlaska that in the VOX Parliamentary Group we regret each and every one of the deaths that occurred on the Moroccan border on 24 June and anyone that occurs in the Mediterranean but Minister it will not be VOX that excuses you because it is your portfolio and this government that implements open door immigration policies that only cause the arrival of massive and disorderly illegal immigration that sows chaos and produces a so called ferocious effect a so called effect that could be observed that same 24 June when all all except your president who did so with delayed effect despite having a caterva of eight hundred advisers of whom four hundred are Presidency we saw the images so lamentable so terrible and so inhumane of the two thousand illegal immigrants who tried to jump the border fence of Beni Ensar with Melilla with more than thirty dead and so many injured But you and I both know that a few days before this avalanche there was a transfer of immigrants from the Melilla CETI to the peninsula and that in these cases it is precisely the NGOs that warn of the low occupation of the CETI making appeals to the mafias and putting into effect what is being translated into tragedy days later You have come to make massive transfers out of the CETI of Melilla up to one hundred and twenty immigrants a day and this only a few months ago in March of this year Wow Mr. Marlaska March just when two attempted assaults on Melilla 's fence also took place in one day Not one but two in March 2022 after you pulled one hundred and twenty immigrants out of CETI They want to give the image that none of the CETI in the cities of Melilla and Ceuta are collapsed producing that so called effect which goes away from their hands with dramas like the one that made him appear today On my last visit to the temporary immigration centre in Ceuta where I asked for information on various aspects concerning the departure of immigrants to the peninsula they assured us that the departures were between ten and twenty illegal per week always keeping the same number of residents In other words every week the same number of illegal immigrants enter the city from CETI in Ceuta to the peninsula I encourage you in your reply if you are going to use it to tell me the exact number of immigrants who have moved from the CETI of Melilla and Ceuta to the peninsula in these years to the head of the Ministry of the Interior it is certainly a very interesting figure And while I wait for your answer here I show a headline El Faro de Melilla March 3 2022 The CETI welcomes 150 migrants after the transfer to the peninsula of 600 in months Congratulations Mr Marlaska you will pass on to history as the minister who never had to the temporary residence centers of saturated immigrants thus contenting NGOs who rarely fulfil the laudable purpose they claim to be defending and who are necessary co-operators of this illegal trafficking in persons thereby enriching the mafias who traffic in human lives both by land and by sea And that Mr. Marlaska I do n't say To a parliamentary question from the VOX Parliamentary Group the Executive provides us with data reflecting a gradual increase year after year in criminal organizations engaged in illegal immigration If we have fourteen criminal organizations dedicated to the trafficking of immigrants accounted for in 2016 we have increased to sixteen in 2017 twenty six in 2018 and thirty in 2020 and we do not have the data of the current number since the statistics have remained in the year of pandemic To date therefore the number of such organizations has doubled as a result of the data they have offered us Congratulations Mr Marlaska congratulations again with you in the Ministry of the Interior the criminal organizations are rubbing their hands literally And congratulations Mr Marlaska you will also pass to history as the Minister of the Interior who produced the effect called voracious and lamentable causing more deaths on both sides of the fence And once I 've congratulated you on being covered in glory in this legislature I 'm going with another aspect We have already said that the deaths occurred on the Moroccan border Therefore the possible violation of human rights denounced by these NGOs and those formations that claim to defend human rights one of which represents in this House ETA 's heirs who took away life the main human right almost a thousand people small is the legitimacy of their denunciation was not on the part of our forces and security forces of the State so they can not be asked for any responsibility That first of all and secondly that 24 June you have acknowledged the facts were perfectly organized and violent Listen our National Police and our Civil Guard in defense of our borders and our sovereignty are in a much smaller number than the assailants They sell anti-disturbing means you leave them in many cases without that material in the vans without effective protective equipment and find themselves with the assault of thousands of armed migrants armed with hooks with hooks with sticks with hooks with shears to

#MaríaTeresaLópezÁlvarez,Thank you very much Mr. Great Marlaska you 've shown that you 're keeping the guy as good as you can with justifications for one another and with lies for another Cheer up you 've got less to run away from But really the only thing I had to tell you about what ministry CETI manages when I told you about immigrant transfers from CETI to the peninsula Do you also want to drain the bulk of those transfers Entering your exhibition I do not know if you have yet to know that we are talking about a matter of defense in the face of the attack of thousands of immigrants to Spain And in the face of those attacks you your Government do not react Well yes by inaction in many cases or by action against in many others I say inaction because it did not give me time in my previous speech to teach you how you defend the border of Melilla in the two assaults that took place in March this year in twenty four hours Onda Tuit Zero Melilla March 3 ten and two minutes in the morning Advance Dozens of sub-Saharan immigrants have managed to access Melilla this morning through the area between the Chinese neighborhood and the Muslim cemetery First tweet from Wave Zero Second tweet by Onda Zero Melilla March 3 ten and twelve minutes in the morning ten minutes apart Nine days of equality begin in the Civil Guard Command Ten minutes difference between one tweet and another will you explain it to me Because this is because in the face of the organized and violent attempt of hundreds of immigrants in March at the Melilla fence you force the Benemerita agents to be on a course on equality while the rest of the troops play their lives on foot without material and without reinforcements Very enlightening of the protection that this Government is doing from our southern border As enlightening as it is that you lie when you talk about reinforcements and the truth ratifies you Mr. Marlaska Interior leaves the squares of 114 civilian guards unreplaced in the fences of Ceuta and Melilla Who do you want to fool Minister Let 's see that entering Spain illegally with violence cannot be a right and the Executive far from admitting the error and implementing a firm immigration policy that seriously protects our borders what it does is allocate public money to feed mafias and NGOs eating that monster from the trade of people fed by the deaths in the ditch and by the sea Human trade will continue as long as this Government does not act firmly As long as they continue to allow the subsidized proliferation of NGOs they will continue to defeat the mafias and as long as that happens they will continue to obtain barbarism Minister with those deaths of immigrants who come to Spain invited by their executive deceived under the promise of a better life and you will continue to obtain barbarism too in those neighborhoods In short chaos everywhere Mr. Marlaska And when he continues to leave our civilian guards on the border and when the Ministry of the Interior has published the vacancies at the national level and we see and see the agents that to top it off he does not take out a single vacancy for the protection and surveillance units of the border perimeter and therefore again acts out of inaction because you bet not to increase the staff of the Benemerita to defend our homeland from violent attacks Faced with this we can only come to a conclusion you this government are an accomplice to the mafia of human trafficking and you can now put all the anti-trepa meshes you want and all the inverted feathers you want that the problem is not the design or shape of the fence because the immigrant who wants to enter illegally is going to make the weapon necessary to stand up and jump Therefore the problem is your open door policy the problem is the so called effect induced by those policies the problem is the subsidies to NGOs increasingly numerous and in increasing quantity for such unhumane purposes as you have shown here today you trying to justify the unjustifiable The problem is their lack of readiness to strengthen our state security forces and bodies at the southern border The problem Mr. Marlaska is you The problem Mr Marlaska is your Government which so wretchedly protects our homeland from the invasions that are being suffered by land and sea,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,F,33.06926,19.53132,14,thank much

#VíctorManuelSánchezDelReal,Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen He 's still shaking with Mr. Mayoral I do n't know what to take but he 's excited Go for God with the demagogy that brings us to this Congress Thank you very much Mr. Mayoral I was coming with good intention because I was going to say how good is the left it 's very good the left is how to say it spectacular incredible wonderful funky great it 's good at one thing but quiet that I 'm not suddenly suffering a sudden conversion I 'm not falling off the horse on the way to Damascus and I 'm not going to speak in Latin although speaking of Spanish Radiotelevision one would have to swear in Aramaic but I have n't had a sudden conversion You are good at one thing because you can be carriers of some absolutely perverse ideas you can have the wrong ideas you can be deeply wrong and you can on top be destructive with everything you touch but you are good at one thing and I admit it propaganda You the left the independenceists are very good at propaganda I 'm really telling you I 'm telling you honestly And I recognize that capacity for the infection of that propaganda in everything they touch It 's infectious in the negative sense do n't come to me that I can keep telling you things It is infectious in negative dirty staining sometimes with the complicity of those who have frightened them I do not know why you have been afraid for so many decades some who once said to be conservative or liberal I do not understand because facing you is very simple with the word with the truth and putting you in front of the mirror of what you do For decades the fear of what they will publish has constrained the political decisions of some groups in this House The desire to go out on the cover of a medium progresses the weekend has led to sympathies and deliveries But I want to make one point for you you will be very good at propaganda but from three years to this part of this House there is a group that does not surrender there is a group that will not give up the arguments there is a group that will face you and that before the media controlled by the left and today we are talking about the public media we will be as uncomfortable as we can so that you have this cultural battle so fun because you were bored before we arrived A few days ago we questioned the minister of propaganda as well major plumber of the kingdom and asked him about independence about the impartiality of Spanish Radiotelevision and how he was going to keep it independent and impartial He did n't answer he put us down from a donkey let go of everything he could say We have data that up to four times has met the outgoing president of Spanish Radiotelevision Mr Pérez Tornero outgoing and hurtful in Moncloa with the Secretary of State for Communication A very simple question of cultural battalion does Spanish Radiotelevision depend on the State Secretariat of the Government of Spain The answer is no no no no no no no no no no no So four small meetings in Moncloa have made clear the interplay that you on the left have so that one of your propaganda axes is Spanish television And secret meetings also with the presidential candidate who the other day in parliamentary office was unable to deny that those meetings had taken place Did Mr. Sánchez send Pérez Tornero the president of Spanish Broadcasting The answer is obviously of course yes and now the secondary actors are on stage Some secondary actors who are those who were already on the board of directors thanks to the quadruple person you know PSOE PP Podemos and my dear gentlemen of the PNV who as I usually tell you are in all the sauces For the Spaniards who are listening to us there was a merit contest and they managed that of those you have put in the one who had the best note was in position number 12 The seventeenth the twenty first the twenty second the thirty fifth and the thirty ninth Do n't worry Mr. Mayoral I 'm telling you 17 21 22 35 and 39 By the way suspense Because they had less than 50 Who was the first suspense The 56th Sure Podemos's was the first suspension had 56 of ordinal and was suspended because he did not even reach the note of 5 as neither did the current president in office They chose the real platoon of the clumsies and of course in clumsies what was going to come out A shameful deal What a cultural battle some have given a small battle through the media And not content with that you have created an organ which we could define almost as a soviet that you call a joint decision making body that will decide on what happens on Spanish Television no less than until 2026 I 'm a soviet Also Stalinist because it's for that for what To worship the image of the beautiful forgiveness of the leader ah yes well let 's say it because it cannot be more beautiful our leader who comes out of each and every circumstance pity or shout at him comes out beautiful thanks to interference on Spanish radios and public televisions That 's his propaganda We say two things The first article 20.3 of the Constitution is very clear the law will regulate the organisation and parliamentary control i.e. from here on of the social media dependent on the State or any public body If the Constitution is not clear we recall that the framework mandate says it has to be independence neutrality pluralism impartiality and rigour Ja ja ja ja ja y ja Six ya Neither independence nor neutrality nor pluralism nor rigour I 'm finishing up Just looking at the last few weeks you 've placed someone who was in the last row and I 'm not talking about the band And the paradigmatic case we have is not just Spanish Television If only in the last few weeks we have these scandals on Spanish Television what can be happening at the EFE Agency which has no parliamentary control even though Article 20.3 of the Constitution says so Look the EFE Agency has to have parliamentary control and this real propaganda state has to end before interference ends There are proposals there We appreciate the contributions that the People 's and Citizens Party has made to us and we are going to work for a compromise so that independence can be restored But look soon will come the days of freedom in the media especially in the public media and freedom of information in Spain not freedom of propaganda And in those days we will stop seeing how they march to the sound of their disgusting propaganda I guarantee that because it will happen because of course it will happen because it will happen very soon Thank you so much,#party.Vox,Vox,ES,#orientation.RRF,M,29.495403,22.787285,14,good afternoon ladies gentlemen 's still shaking mr. mayoral n't know take 's excited go god demagogy brings us
