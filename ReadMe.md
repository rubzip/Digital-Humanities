# Far-right Speech in ParlaMint

This repository contains the code for the project **Far-right Speech in ParlaMint**. 

Our aim is to perform an exploratory work to identify the most common topics in far-right parties and compare them in their different contexts.


## :pencil: Data

The data has been extracted and preprocessed from the [ParlaMint](https://www.clarin.eu/parlamint) dataset. 

We have extracted the speeches and interventions in the respective parliaments from alt-right parties of the countries: Spain, Italy, Hungary and Greece; from years 2021 to 2022. The final dataset is available on kaggle: [alt_right_parties_parlamint_2021-2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airalribalta/alt-right-parties-parlamint-2021-2022).
